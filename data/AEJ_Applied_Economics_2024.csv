AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Curse of Plenty: The Green Revolution and the Rise in Chronic Disease,Sheetal Sekhri and Gauri Shastry,"The rising rate of chronic disease is a leading driver of the global disease burden. Yet, its determinants are not fully understood. Exploiting the Green Revolution and its expansion in historically groundwater-rich Indian districts, we examine the unanticipated contribution of agricultural productivity growth to the rise in chronic, diet-related diseases. We find that areas with greater adoption of new staple varieties saw an increase in diabetes in men born after the introduction of high-yield crops. We find suggestive evidence that diet is an important mechanism, such as heterogeneous impacts with respect to dietary habits and increases in household calorie consumption.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220621
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Optimal Sin Taxation and Market Power,Martin O'Connell and Kate Smith,"We study how market power impacts the efficiency and redistributive properties of sin taxation, with an empirical application to sugar-sweetened beverage taxation. We estimate an equilibrium model of the UK drinks market, which we embed in a tax design framework to solve for optimal sugar-sweetened beverage tax policy. Positive price-cost margins for drinks create inefficiencies that lower the optimal rate compared with a perfectly competitive setting. Since profits mainly accrue to the rich, this is partially mitigated under social preferences for equity. Overall, ignoring market power when setting tax policy leads to welfare gains 40 percent below those at the optimum.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220407
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Distortion by Audit: Evidence from Public Procurement,"Maria Paula Gerardino, Stephan Litschig and Dina Pomeranz","Public sector audits are key to state capacity. However, they can create unintended distortions. Regression discontinuity analysis from Chile shows that audits lowered the use of auctions for public procurement, reduced supplier competition, and increased the likelihood of small, local, and incumbent firms winning contracts. Looking inside the black box of the audit process reveals that relative to comparable direct contracts, auctions underwent more than twice as many checks and led to twice as many detected infractions. These findings show that standard audit protocols can mechanically discourage the use of more regulated, complex, and transparent procedures involving more auditable steps.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220512
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,"Schoolgirls, Not Brides: Education as a Shield against Child Marriage","Hélène Giacobino, Elise Huillery, Bastien Michel and Mathilde Sage","We study the impact of a scholarship-based intervention aimed to reduce child marriage by fostering secondary education among adolescent girls in Niger. Using a large-scale randomized controlled trial, we find that after three years of implementation, the intervention led to large and positive effects. It halved both dropout and marriage rates and increased girls' and their parents' aspirations. Importantly, there is no displacement effect detrimental to the education and marriage status of nontreatment girls. Our results show that financial aid for education has the potential to transform adolescent girls' lives.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220443
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Expected Returns to Crime and Crime Location,"Nils Braakmann, Arnaud Chevalier and Tanya Wilson","We provide first evidence that variations in the expected returns to crime affect the location of property crime. Our identification strategy relies on the widely held perception in the United Kingdom that South Asian households store gold jewelry at home. Price movements on the international market for gold exogenously affect the expected gains from burgling these households. Using a neighborhood-level panel on crime and difference-in-differences, we find that burglaries in South Asian neighborhoods are more sensitive to variations in the gold price than other neighborhoods in the same municipality. We conduct various tests on neighborhood and individual data to eliminate alternative explanations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220585
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Unintended Consequences of Welfare Cuts on Children and Adolescents,"Christian Dustmann, Rasmus Landersø and Lars Højsgaard Andersen","This paper studies the effects of a large welfare benefit reduction on the children in the affected families. The welfare cut targeted adult refugees who received residency in Denmark, and it reduced their disposable income by 30 percent on average over the first five years. We show that children exposed to the welfare cut during preschool and school-age obtained lower GPAs, experienced reduced well-being and overall education levels, and suffered lower employment and earnings as adults. Children in their teens at exposure faced large increases in conviction probabilities for violent and property crimes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230519
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,When Dad Can Stay Home: Fathers' Workplace Flexibility and Maternal Health,Petra Persson and Maya Rossin-Slater,We study how fathers' access to workplace flexibility affects maternal postpartum health. We use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more flexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period and show that increasing the father's temporal flexibility—and thereby his ability to be present at home together with the mother—reduces the incidence of maternal postpartum health complications. Our results suggest that mothers bear part of the burden from a lack of workplace flexibility for men because a father's inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health cost of childbearing.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220400
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Paradox of Innovation Nondisclosure: Evidence from Licensing Contracts,"Gaurav Kankanhalli, Alan Kwan and Kenneth Merkley","Innovative firms must trade off disclosing to investors and maintaining secrecy from competitors. We study this trade-off in a sample of IP licenses mandatorily disclosed by US public firms, whose contents can be temporarily redacted. Hand classifying the redacted information, we find that firms with valuable IP in competitive markets redact IP information more often. Markets react positively to the redaction of IP information, consistent with theoretical predictions rationalizing a separating equilibrium in which nondisclosure signals more valuable IP. Our results suggest that credible nondisclosure partially resolves information frictions for innovative public firms when facilitated by sophisticated investors.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230046
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,"Preferences, Access, and the STEM Gender Gap in Centralized High School Assignment",Diana Ngo and Andrew Dustan,"The gender gap in STEM widens during high school due both to differences in student choices and institutional barriers to accessing STEM education. Using rich data from Mexico City's centralized assignment system and a structural model of high school choice, we document strong demand for elite STEM programs and relatively weak demand for non-elite STEM programs. Decomposition and counterfactual simulations demonstrate that most of the gap is due to gendered choices, with males more strongly preferring STEM. Test-based assignment restricts elite STEM access for females, who have lower placement test scores despite similar low-stakes exam scores.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220450
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Experience-Based Discrimination,Louis-Pierre Lepage,"I study discrimination arising from individual experiences of employers with worker groups. I present a model in which employers are uncertain about the productivity of one of two groups and learn through hiring. Positive experiences lead to positive biases, which correct themselves by leading to more hiring and learning. Negative experiences decrease hiring and learning, preserving negative biases, which can cause persistent discrimination. The model explains prejudice as incorrect statistical discrimination and generates novel predictions and policy implications. I then illustrate experience-based discrimination in an experimental labor market, finding support for key model predictions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220466
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,"Noise, Cognitive Function, and Worker Productivity",Joshua Dean,"Noisy workplaces common in low- and middle-income countries can impair workers' cognitive functions. However, whether this lowers earnings depends on the importance of these functions for productivity and whether workers understand these effects. I study these questions with two randomized experiments in Nairobi, Kenya. I find a noise increase of 7 dB reduces productivity in a textile training course by 3 percent, impairs cognitive function, but does not affect effort. I also find willingness to pay for quiet working conditions does not depend on whether pay depends on performance, suggesting participants are not aware that quiet would increase their productivity.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220532
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,"Independent Media, Propaganda, and Religiosity: Evidence from Poland","Irena Grosfeld, Etienne Madinier, Seyhun Orcan Sakalli and Ekaterina Zhuravskaya","Exploring a drastic change in media landscape in Poland, we show that mainstream media can significantly affect religious participation. After nationalist populist party PiS came to power in 2015, news on state and private independent TV diverged due to propaganda on state TV, resulting in a switch of some of its audience to independent TV. Municipalities with access to independent TV continued to follow a long-term secularization trend, while municipalities with access only to state TV experienced a reversal of this trend. An online experiment sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the effect of exposure to independent news on religiosity.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220645
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Customer Capital Spillovers: Evidence from Sales Managers in International Markets,Bérengère Patault and Clémence Lenoir,"Expanding their customer base is crucial for firms to grow. This paper leverages sales managers' job-to-job transitions to better understand how buyer-seller relationships form. Combining unique French firm-to-firm trade data with matched employer-employee data, we perform an event study analysis that exploits the timing of sales managers' transitions from one firm to another for identification. We find recruiting a sales manager increases by 36 percent the probability to export to the buyers of her former firm. The expansion of the firm's customer base is detrimental to the buyer's former suppliers. Yet business stealing is partial; job-to-job transitions are not zero-sum.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220572
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Family Formation and Crime,Maxim Massenkoff and Evan K. Rose,"We perform a large-scale analysis of the impact of family formation on crime. For mothers, criminal arrests drop precipitously in the first few months of pregnancy, decreasing 50 percent overall. Men show a sustained 20 percent decline in crime that begins around pregnancy, although arrests for domestic violence spike at birth. A separate design using parents of stillborn children to estimate counterfactual arrest rates reinforces the main findings. Marriage, in contrast, is not associated with any sudden changes and marks the completion of a gradual 50 percent decline in arrests for both men and women.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220751
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Dynamic Response of Municipal Budgets to Revenue Shocks,Ines Helm and Jan Stuhler,"We study the fiscal and tax response to intergovernmental grants, exploiting quasi-experimental variation within Germany's fiscal equalization scheme triggered by census revisions of population counts. Municipal budgets do not adjust instantly. Instead, spending and investments adapt within five years to revenue gains, while the adjustment to losses is more rapid. Yet the long-run response is symmetric. The tax response is particularly slow, stretching over more than a decade. Well-known empirical anomalies such as the so-called flypaper effect may thus reflect a short-run phenomenon, while long-run fiscal behavior appears more consistent with standard theories of fiscal federalism.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220718
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,"Working Remotely? Selection, Treatment, and the Market for Remote Work",Natalia Emanuel and Emma Harrington,"How does remote work affect productivity and how productive are workers who choose remote jobs? We decompose these effects in a Fortune 500 firm. Before COVID-19, remote workers answered 12 percent fewer calls per hour than on-site workers. After offices closed, the productivity gap narrowed by 4 percent, and formerly on-site workers' call quality and promotion rates declined. Even with everyone remote, an 8 percent productivity gap persisted, indicating negative selection into remote jobs. A cost-benefit analysis indicates savings in reduced turnover and office rents could outweigh remote work's negative productivity impact but not the costs of attracting less productive workers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230376
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Persecution and Escape: Professional Networks and High-Skilled Emigration from Nazi Germany,"Sascha Becker, Volker Lindenthal, Sharun W. Mukand and Fabian Waldinger","We study the role of professional networks in facilitating emigration of Jewish academics dismissed from their positions by the Nazi government. We use individual-level exogenous variation in the timing of dismissals to estimate causal effects. Academics with more ties to early emigres (emigrated 1933–1934) were more likely to emigrate. Early emigres functioned as ""bridging nodes"" that facilitated emigration to their own destination. We also provide evidence of decay in social ties over time and show that professional networks transmit information that is not publicly observable. Finally, we study the relative importance of three types (family, community, professional) of social networks.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220278
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Fighting for Tyranny: State Repression and Combat Motivation,"Arturas Rozenas, Roya Talibova and Yuri M. Zhukov","We utilize over 100 million declassified Red Army personnel records from World War II to study how state repression shapes soldiers' motivation to exert effort in fighting. Exploiting multiple complementary identification strategies, we find that soldiers from places with higher levels of prewar repression under Stalin's rule were more likely to fight until death and less likely to shirk their duties, but they also received fewer decorations for personal bravery. The coercive incentives created by repression appear to have induced obedience at the expense of initiative and increased the human costs of war.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220085
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Activated History: The Case of the Turkish Sieges of Vienna,Christian Ochsner and Felix Roesel,"We show that history stored in collective memories and activated by political campaigns can create xenophobia and radicalization. Turkish troops besieged Vienna in 1529 and 1683 and pillaged individual Austrian villages, killing and kidnapping in the process. Attacked places remember those events well but never expressed aversion to Muslims until far-right populists started to campaign against Turks and Muslims in the mid-2000s. We find anti-Muslim sentiments and far-right voting surge in previously attacked places after the populist campaigns were launched, and Turkish communities decrease in response. Historical narratives in political campaigns can mobilize both beliefs and actions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190686
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Health Care Centralization: The Health Impacts of Obstetric Unit Closures in the United States,"Stefanie Fischer, Heather Royer and Corey White","Over the last few decades, health care services in the United States have become more geographically centralized. We study how the loss of hospital-based obstetric units in over 400 counties affects maternal and infant health via a difference-in-differences design. We find that closures lead mothers to experience a significant change in birth procedures such as inductions and C-sections. In contrast to concerns voiced in the public discourse, the effects on a range of maternal and infant health outcomes are negligible or slightly beneficial. While women travel farther to receive care, closures induce women to receive higher quality care.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220341
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,"The Impacts of Physician Payments on Patient Access, Use, and Health",Diane Alexander and Molly Schnell,"We examine how supply-side health insurance generosity affects patient access, use, and health. Exploiting large, exogenous changes in Medicaid reimbursement rates for physicians, we find that increasing payments for new patient office visits reduces reports of providers turning away beneficiaries: closing the gap in payments between Medicaid and private insurers would reduce more than half of disparities in access among adults and would eliminate such disparities among children. We further find that higher physician reimbursement leads to more office visits, better self-reported health, and reduced school absenteeism among the program's beneficiaries.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210227
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Patient versus Provider Incentives in Long-Term Care,"Martin B. Hackmann, R. Vincent Pohl and Nicolas Ziebarth","How do patient and provider incentives affect the provision of long-term care? Our analysis of 551,000 nursing home stays yields three main insights. First, due to limited cost-sharing, Medicaid-covered residents prolong their nursing home stays instead of transitioning to community-based care. Second, when facility capacity binds, nursing homes shorten Medicaid stays to admit more profitable out-of-pocket private payers. Third, providers react more elastically to financial incentives than patients. Thus, targeting provider incentives through alternative payment models, such as episode-based reimbursement, is more effective than increasing patient cost sharing in facilitating transitions to community-based care and generating long-term care savings.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210264
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Socioeconomic Disparities in Privatized Pollution Remediation: Evidence from Toxic Chemical Spills,Justin Marion and Jeremy West,"Governments often privatize the administration of regulations to third-party specialists paid for by the regulated parties. We study how the resulting conflict of interest can have unintended consequences for the distributional impacts of regulation. In Massachusetts, the party responsible for hazardous waste contamination must hire a licensed contractor to quantify the environmental severity. We find that contractors' evaluations favor their clients, exhibiting substantial score bunching just below thresholds that determine government oversight of the remediation. Client favoritism is more pronounced in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods and is associated with inferior remediation quality, highlighting a novel channel for inequities in pollution exposure.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220295
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Civil Service Exams and Organizational Performance: Evidence from the Pendleton Act,Diana Moreira and Santiago Perez,"We use newly digitized data to study the impacts of a historical reform that mandated exams for some employees in the largest US customs-collection districts. Although the reform improved targeted employees' professional backgrounds and reduced turnover, it did not lead to significant improvements in the cost-effectiveness of customs revenue collection. The incomplete reach of the reform was key for this partial success. First, the reform incentivized hiring in exam-exempted positions, distorting districts' hierarchical structure. Second, since we find suggestive evidence that districts' top managers mattered for performance, not changing their appointment method might have constituted a missed opportunity for improvement.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220284
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,When Individual Politics Become Public: Do Civil Service Protections Insulate Government Workers?,Morgan Foy,"This paper examines whether the civil service system protected state bureaucrats from political interference following a recall petition against the governor of Wisconsin. I find that most classified workers, who were covered by the state civil service laws, were paid equally by signing status following the public disclosure of the petition list. Conversely, signers in the unclassified service, a smaller set of government positions, were paid about 3 percent less annually relative to nonsigners in the postdisclosure period. These results indicate that the civil service insulated qualified bureaucrats, while uncovered workers faced retribution.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220723
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Public Information Is an Incentive for Politicians: Experimental Evidence from Delhi Elections,"Abhijit Banerjee, Nils Enevoldsen, Rohini Pande and Michael Walton","Two years prior to elections, two-thirds of Delhi municipal councillors learned they had been randomly chosen for a preelection newspaper report card. Treated councillors in high-slum areas increased pro-poor spending, relative both to control counterparts and treated counterparts from low-slum areas. Treated incumbents ineligible to rerun in home wards because of randomly assigned gender quotas were substantially likelier to run elsewhere only if their report card showed a strong pro-poor spending record. Parties also benefited electorally from councillors' high pro-poor spending. In contrast, in a cross-cut experiment, councillors did not react to actionable information that was not publicly disclosed.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220088
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Great Migration and Educational Opportunity,"Cavit Baran, Eric Chyn and Bryan Stuart","This paper studies the impact of the First Great Migration on children. We use the complete-count 1940 census to estimate selection-corrected place effects on education for children of Black migrants. On average, Black children gained 0.8 years of schooling (12 percent) by moving from the South to the North. Many counties that had the strongest positive impacts on children during the 1940s offer relatively poor opportunities for Black youth today. Opportunities for Black children were greater in places with more schooling investment, stronger labor market opportunities for Black adults, more social capital, and less crime.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220079
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Evolution of Local Labor Markets after Recessions,Brad Hershbein and Bryan Stuart,"This paper studies how US local labor markets respond to employment losses that occur during recessions. Following recessions from 1973 through 2009, we find areas that lose more jobs during the recession experience persistent relative declines in employment and population. Most importantly, these local labor markets also experience persistent decreases in the employment-population ratio, earnings per capita, and earnings per worker. Our results imply that limited population responses result in longer-lasting consequences for local labor markets than previously thought and that recessions are followed by persistent reallocation of employment across space.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220132
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Impact of Benefit Generosity on Workers' Compensation Claims: Evidence and Implications,Marika Cabral and Marcus Dillender,"Leveraging unique administrative data and a sharp increase in benefit generosity in a difference-in-differences research design, we estimate the impact of workers' compensation wage replacement benefits on individual behavior and program costs. We find that increased benefit generosity leads to longer income benefit durations and increased medical spending. Responses along these two margins are equally important drivers of increased program costs, collectively increasing program costs 1.4 times the mechanical increase in costs. Using these estimates and an estimate of the consumption drop among injured workers, our welfare calibrations suggest that a marginal increase in benefit generosity would not improve welfare.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220032
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Spillovers without Social Interactions in Urban Sanitation,"Joshua Deutschmann, Molly Lipscomb, Laura Schechter and Jessica Zhu","We run a randomized controlled trial coupled with lab-in-the-field social network experiments in urban Dakar. Decision spillovers and health externalities play a large role in determining uptake of sanitation technology, with decision spillovers being largest among households that don't receive significant subsidies. There is no evidence that the spillovers are explained by social forces in general, nor by specific social mechanisms such as learning from others, social pressure, or reciprocity. We do find evidence of a fourth, nonsocial, mechanism impacting decisions: increasing health benefits. As more neighbors adopt the sanitary technology, it becomes more worthwhile for other households to adopt as well.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220047
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Human Capital Effects of Access to Elite Jobs,Huayu Xu and Achyuta Adhvaryu,"We study the human capital effects of access to elite bureaucratic jobs in Taiwan, where performance on an examination determines entry into the civil service. Historically, quotas for successful applicants were set based on the 1948 populations of individuals' native provinces in mainland China. This resulted in a higher probability of success on the exam—and, thus, greater access to elite positions—for descendants of certain migrant groups. These preferential quotas were replaced in 1962 with a uniform admissions policy. Using this variation, we find that the incentives created by preferential quotas increased human capital and improved long-run economic outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220340
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Consumer Protection in an Online World: An Analysis of Occupational Licensing,"Chiara Farronato, Andrey Fradkin, Bradley Larsen and Erik Brynjolfsson","We study the demand and supply implications of occupational licensing using transaction-level data from a large online platform for home improvement services. We find that demand is more responsive to a professional's reviews than to the professional's platform-verified licensing status. We show some evidence that consumers view licenses and reviews as substitutes. We confirm the generality of our findings off the platform in an independent consumer survey. Combining state-level licensing regulation data with platform microdata, we find that more stringent requirements are associated with less competition, higher prices, and no increase in demand or consumer satisfaction.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210716

Munk, Martin Nybom, Yuri Ostrovsky, Sumaiya Rahman and Outi Sirniö","We use linked parent-child administrative data for five countries in North America and Europe, as well as detailed survey data for two more, to investigate methodological challenges in the estimation of absolute income mobility. We show that the commonly used ""copula and marginals"" approximation methods perform well across countries in our sample, and the greatest challenges to their accuracy stem not from assumptions about relative mobility rates over time but from the use of nonrepresentative marginal income distributions.

We quantify the extent of redistribution—the reduction from pretax to posttax inequality—and estimate the contribution of redistribution in explaining differences in posttax inequality. We find that differences in pretax inequality drive most of the differences in posttax inequality between France and the United States, and that changes over time in both countries are mostly due to changes in pretax inequality. We highlight that the concept of redistribution can be empirically misleading for judging how policies reduce inequalities.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220023
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Intergenerational Mobility in India: New Measures and Estimates across Time and Social Groups,"Sam Asher, Paul Novosad and Charlie Rafkin","We study intergenerational mobility in India. We propose a new measure of upward mobility: the expected education rank of a child born to parents in the bottom half of the education distribution. This measure works well under data constraints common in developing countries and historical contexts. Intergenerational mobility in India has been constant and low since before liberalization. Among sons, we observe rising mobility for Scheduled Castes and declining mobility among Muslims. Daughters' intergenerational mobility is lower than sons', with less cross-group variation over time. A natural experiment suggests that affirmative action for Scheduled Castes has substantially improved their mobility.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210686

We find that Florentine society was more mobile than one would expect but also that multigenerational mobility was lower than implied by two-generation estimates. We reconcile these findings by showing their consistency with a model where wealth transmission is governed by an unobserved latent factor. We also show that, given our estimates, this model is compatible with the long run persistence obtained by previous studies.

Using a caseworker placement tendencies design and a novel dataset constructed by linking administrative records from multiple public agencies in Los Angeles County, I estimate that rapidly placing individuals in housing programs significantly reduces the likelihood of future return to the homeless support system, crime, and reliance on emergency cash assistance, yet it does not have a detectable effect on health services utilization.

We find a very high correlation of gender biases for teachers across their classes. We find a substantial impact of gender bias on student performance in university admissions exams, choice of university field of study, and quality of the enrolled program. The effects on university choice outcomes are larger for girls, explaining some gender differences in STEM majors.

Efforts to improve learning involve spreading information from government agents to farmers. We show that when compared to this government approach, informing private input suppliers in India about a new seed variety increases farmer-level adoption by over 50 percent. Suppliers become more proactive in informing potential customers and carrying the new variety. They induce increased adoption by those with higher returns from the technology. Being motivated by expanded sales offers the most likely motive for these results.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220037

Evidence from a Field Experiment,Hannah Trachtman,"Impact evaluations of behavioral interventions typically focus on target outcomes. Might interventions induce negative spillovers on other behaviors? I run a large field experiment in which individuals receive combinations of messages and incentives promoting two healthy behaviors, meditation and meal logging. I find that the interventions reduce completion rates of the opposite behavior by 19–29 percent. I find that interventions with larger target effects do not necessarily generate larger negative spillovers, and demonstrate implications for cost-effectiveness analysis. I investigate the mechanisms behind the observed spillovers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210788
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,SeaTE: Subjective Ex Ante Treatment Effect of Health on Retirement,Pamela Giustinelli and Matthew Shapiro,The paper studies the effect of health on work among older workers by eliciting two- and four-year-ahead subjective probabilities of working under alternative health states. These measures predict work outcomes. Person-specific differences in working probabilities across health states can be interpreted as Subjective ex ante Treatment Effects (SeaTEs) in a potential outcomes framework and as taste for work within a discrete choice dynamic programming framework. There is substantial heterogeneity in expectations of work conditional on health. The paper shows how heterogeneity in taste for work correlated with health can bias regression estimates of the effect of health on retirement.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210316
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,How the Internet Changed the Market for Print Media,"Manudeep Bhuller, Tarjei Havnes, Jeremy McCauley and Magne Mogstad","Combining rich data from the Norwegian media market with exogenous variation in the availability and adoption of broadband internet, this paper provides causal evidence on how the internet affected traditional print media. Broadband internet adoption triggered large reductions in print readership and circulation and equally large increases in online news readership. Despite strong substitution from print to online news consumption, newspaper revenues fell dramatically. Newspapers responded to this adverse technology shock along multiple dimensions, including cutting costs by reducing labor inputs and the physical newspaper size and changing the print product available to customers by reducing tabloid content share.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210689
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,"What's behind Her Smile? Health, Looks, and Self-Esteem","Francisco Gallego, Cristian Larroulet Philippi and Andrea Repetto","This paper examines how improving dental health affects economic, social, and psychological outcomes. In a randomized experiment, we provide a low-income group free dental care, including prostheses, and find significant and persistent impacts on men's and women's dental and self-perceived mental health. For women, treatment generates improvement in self-esteem, a higher likelihood of smiling when photographed, short-run improvements in employment and earnings, and improvement in partner interactions. We find no impact for men in these dimensions. Heterogeneity analyses suggest that treatment effects on labor market outcomes are larger for women with more severe visible dental issues at baseline.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210248
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Effects of Roads on Trade and Migration: Evidence from a Planned Capital City,Melanie Morten and Jaqueline Oliveira,"A large body of literature studies how infrastructure facilitates trade. We ask whether infrastructure also facilitates migration. Using a general equilibrium trade model and rich spatial data, we study the impact of a large, plausibly exogenous shock to highways in Brazil on both goods and labor markets. We find the highway system increased welfare by 2.8 percent, of which 76 percent was due to reduced trade costs and 24 percent to reduced migration costs. An implication of costly migration is spatial heterogeneity in benefits: the range of welfare improvement is 1 to 15 percent, as opposed to uniform gains with perfect mobility.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180487
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Improving Women's Mental Health during a Pandemic,"Michael Vlassopoulos, Abu Siddique, Tabassum Rahman, Debayan Pakrashi, Asad Islam and Firoz Ahmed","This paper evaluates a randomized, over-the-phone counseling intervention aimed at mitigating the mental health impact of COVID-19 on a sample of 2,402 women across 357 villages in Bangladesh. We find that the provision of two hours of mental support plus information on COVID-19 improves mental health ten months postintervention, leading to reductions of 20 percent in the prevalence of moderate and severe stress and 33 percent in depression. Our results suggest that this type of low-cost intervention ($14 per person) can be effective in providing rapid psychological support to vulnerable groups in times of crises.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210655
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Employment Effects of Ethnic Politics,"Francesco Amodio, Giorgio Chiovelli and Sebastian Hohmann","We study the labor market consequences of ethnic politics in African democracies. Using subnational georeferenced data from 15 countries from 1996 to 2017, we compare individuals from ethnicities linked to parties at the margin of electing a representative in the national parliament. Having a local ethnic party politician in parliament increases the likelihood of being employed by 2–3 percentage points. The effect is concentrated in the agricultural sector and mostly driven by self-employment, suggesting increased access to land as the main channel. We also show that religion and age are salient markers in African politics that trigger similar employment effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210579
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Impact of Cash Transfers to Poor Mothers on Family Structure and Maternal Well-Being,"Anna Aizer, Sungwoo Cho, Shari Eli and Adriana Lleras-Muney","We use newly collected data for 16,000 women who applied for Mothers' Pensions, America's first welfare program, to investigate the effect of means-tested cash transfers on lifetime family structure and maternal well-being. In the short term, cash transfers delayed marriage and lowered geographic mobility. In the long run, transfers had no impact on the probability of remarriage, spouse quality, or fertility. Cash transfers did not affect women's well-being, measured by longevity and family income in 1940. Given the lack of significant negative behavioral impacts, the benefits of transfers appear to exceed costs if they have—even modest—positive impacts on children.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210816
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Maternal Dengue and Health Outcomes of Children,Martin Foureaux Koppensteiner and Lívia Menezes,"We study the effect of maternal dengue infections on birth outcomes using linked administrative records from Brazil estimating maternal fixed-effect specifications. In contrast to previous studies, we find robust evidence for the negative effect of dengue infections on birth weight (BW). The effect is particularly pronounced at lower parts of the BW distribution, with an increase of 15 percent, 67 percent, and 133 percent for low, very low, and extremely low BW, respectively. We also document large increases in children's hospitalizations and medical expenditures for up to three years after birth.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210656
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Affirmative Action and Precollege Human Capital,"Mitra Akhtari, Natalie Bau and Jean-William Laliberté","Though racial affirmative action (AA) policies are widespread in college admissions, evidence on their effects before college is limited. We study a US Supreme Court ruling that reinstated AA in three states. Using nationwide SAT data, we separately identify positive effects of AA for Whites and underrepresented minorities. Using Texas administrative data, we find that AA narrowed racial gaps in grades, attendance, and college applications. Improvements in minorities precollege human capital and college applications are concentrated in the top half of the test score distribution among the students for whom the policy most increases the returns to human capital investment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210807
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Estimating the Distaste for Price Gouging with Incentivized Consumer Reports,"Justin Holz, Rafael Jiménez-Durán and Eduardo Laguna-Müggenburg","Thirty-four states prohibit price increases during emergencies, and individuals take costly actions to report violators. We measure experimentally the willingness to pay to report sellers who increase prices of personal protective equipment. Over 75 percent of subjects pay to report, even if others are willing to buy at those prices. We argue that reports contain information about a desire to prevent or punish third-party transactions at unfair or illicit prices. Reports are partially driven by a distaste for firm profits or markups, implying that the distribution of surplus between producers and consumers matters for welfare.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210428
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Unintended Consequences of Test-Based Remediation,David Figlio and Umut Ozek,"School systems around the world use achievement tests to assign students to schools, classes, and instructional resources, including remediation. Using a regression discontinuity design, we study a Florida policy that places middle school students who score below a proficiency cutoff into remedial classes. Students scoring below the cutoff receive more educational resources, but they are also placed in classes that are more segregated by race, socioeconomic status, and prior achievement. Increased tracking occurs not only in the remedial subject, but in other core subjects. These tracking effects are significantly larger and more likely to persist beyond the year of remediation for Black students.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210037
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Reversing the Resource Curse: Foreign Corruption Regulation and the Local Economic Benefits of Resource Extraction,"Hans B. Christensen, Mark Maffett and Thomas Rauter","We examine how foreign corruption regulation affects the economic benefits communities receive from extraction activities in the resource-rich areas of Africa. After a mid-2000s increase in enforcement of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), nighttime luminosity increases by 15 percent (5 percent) in communities within a 10-kilometer (25-kilometer) radius of affected extraction facilities. Cash-wage employment also increases significantly, suggesting that the economic benefits are not limited to electricity access. Consistent with foreign corruption regulation mitigating the political resource curse, we find that perceived corruption decreases following the rise in FCPA enforcement.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210408
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Impact of Youth Medicaid Eligibility on Adult Incarceration,"Samuel Arenberg, Seth Neller and Sam Stripling","This paper identifies an important spillover associated with public health insurance: reduced incarceration. In 1990, Congress passed legislation that increased Medicaid eligibility for individuals born after September 30, 1983. We show that Black children born just after the cutoff are 5 percent less likely to be incarcerated by age 28, driven primarily by a decrease in incarcerations connected to financially motivated offenses. Children of other races, who experienced almost no gain in Medicaid coverage as a result of the policy, demonstrate no such decline. We find that reduced incarceration in adulthood substantially offsets the initial costs of expanding eligibility.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200785
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Does Exposure to Other Ethnic Regions Promote National Integration? Evidence from Nigeria,Oyebola Okunogbe,"This paper examines how temporary exposure to a different ethnic region affects national integration, using original survey data from participants in Africa's largest national youth service program. Seven years later, participants randomly assigned to serve in a state with a different ethnic majority are five times more likely to live all across the country compared to those who served in their ethnic region. They have more interethnic romantic relationships and express greater national pride. Nevertheless, immersion in a different region strengthens participants' ethnic pride and favorable attitudes toward co-ethnics. The results suggest that national and ethnic identity can thrive together.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210266
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,At What Level Should One Cluster Standard Errors in Paired and Small-Strata Experiments?,Clément de Chaisemartin and Jaime Ramirez-Cuellar,"In matched pairs experiments in which one cluster per pair of clusters is assigned to treatment, to estimate treatment effects, researchers often regress their outcome on a treatment indicator and pair fixed effects, clustering standard errors at the unit-of-randomization level. We show that even if the treatment has no effect, a 5 percent–level t-test based on this regression will wrongly conclude that the treatment has an effect up to 16.5 percent of the time. To fix this problem, researchers should instead cluster standard errors at the pair level. Using simulations, we show that similar results apply to clustered experiments with small strata.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210252
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Informed Enforcement: Lessons from Pollution Monitoring in China,Sebastian Axbard and Zichen Deng,"Government regulations are often imperfectly enforced by public officials. In this study, we exploit the introduction of air pollution monitors in China to investigate whether real-time monitoring of policy outcomes affects the enforcement of existing regulations. Using assignment criteria established by the central government and new georeferenced data on local enforcement activities, we show that monitoring (i) increases enforcement against local firms, (ii) improves the targeting of enforcement, and (iii) reduces aggregate pollution. These effects are driven by officials facing performance incentives and are stronger when there is limited scope for data manipulation, suggesting that real-time monitoring improves top-down accountability.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210386
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Marginal Returns to Distance Education: Evidence from Mexico's Telesecundarias,Emilio Borghesan and Gabrielle Vasey,"This paper analyzes a large-scale and long-running distance education program in Mexico. We estimate marginal treatment effects (MTEs) for learning in math and Spanish in telesecundarias relative to traditional Mexican secondary schools using an empirical framework that allows for unobserved sorting on gains. The estimated MTEs reveal that school choice is not random and that the average student experiences significant improvements in both math and Spanish after just one year of attendance in telesecundarias. We find that the existing policy reduces educational inequality, and our policy-relevant treatment effects show that expanding telesecundarias would yield significant improvements in academic performance.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220065

Comparing the Impacts of Loans and Grants for Microenterprise Development,"Bruno Crépon, Mohamed El-Komi and Adam Osman","Is the type of financial support provided to businesses more important than which businesses receive it? Loans and grants can lead to differences in optimal investments and in scope for moral hazard. We randomize 3,293 business loan applicants into receiving a loan, cash grant, in-kind grant, or nothing. All treatments equally increase income, yet there are large differences within a treatment group with impacts concentrated at the top of the distribution. Those who succeed with loans are observationally equivalent to those who succeed with grants, showcasing that owner heterogeneity is more important than the type of support received in microenterprise development.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210683
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Gender Attitudes in the Judiciary: Evidence from US Circuit Courts,"Elliott Ash, Daniel L. Chen and Arianna Ornaghi","Do gender attitudes influence interactions with female judges in US circuit courts? In this paper, we propose a judge-specific measure of gender attitudes based on use of gender-stereotyped language in the judge's authored opinions. Exploiting quasi-random assignment of judges to cases and conditioning on judges' characteristics, we validate the measure showing that higher-slant judges vote more conservatively in gender-related cases. Higher-slant judges interact differently with female colleagues: they are more likely to reverse lower court decisions if the lower court judge is a woman than a man, are less likely to assign opinions to female judges, and cite fewer female-authored opinions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210435
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,The Value of Leisure Synchronization,"Simon Georges-Kot, Dominique Goux and Eric Maurin","This paper explores the extent to which workers are willing to trade hours worked for leisure time shared with their spouse. We use the fact that the number and timing of paid vacation days to which French employees are entitled vary in a quasi-random way from year to year along with the dates of public holidays. Self-employed workers do not benefit from public holidays, but we show that a large fraction of them substitute a day of unpaid leisure for a day of paid work whenever their spouse gets an extra day of paid leave.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220184
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Increasing the Cost of Informal Employment: Evidence from Mexico,Brenda Samaniego  de la Parra and Leon Fernandez Bujanda,"We estimate the effect of increasing the cost of informal jobs on formal firms' and workers' outcomes. We combine administrative records and household surveys and exploit exogenous variation in the cost of informality generated by over 480,000 random worksite inspections in Mexico. For informal workers, inspections temporarily increase the probability of being formalized at the inspected firm, but separations also rise. For formal workers, we find temporary increases in the probability of remaining formally employed at the inspected firm and in monthly wages. At the firm level, increasing the cost of informal jobs leads to persistently lower formal employment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200763
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,What Impacts Can We Expect from School Spending Policy? Evidence from Evaluations in the United States,C. Kirabo Jackson and Claire L. Mackevicius,"We conduct meta-analysis on a comprehensive set of studies of the impacts of US K-12 public school spending on student outcomes—estimating average marginal impacts and heterogeneity across contexts. On average, a policy increasing spending by $1,000 per pupil for four years improves test scores by 0.0316σ and college-going by 2.8 pp. Moving beyond averages, we use estimates of heterogeneity and observable policy differences to produce informative probability distributions of policy effects. Effects are smaller for economically advantaged populations, marginal effects of capital spending are similar to noncapital, and effects are similar across baseline spending levels and geography. Confounding and publication biases are minimal.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220279
AEJ: Applied Economics,2024,Employer Concentration and Wages for Specialized Workers,Anna Thoresson,"This paper studies how wages respond to a sudden change in employer concentration by using the deregulation of the Swedish pharmacy industry. The reform involved a substantial and policy-driven increase in the number of employers that varied by local labor market. Exploiting this variation, elasticities of wages with respect to labor market concentration are estimated between −0.025 and −0.061. The positive wage effects from reduced employer concentration are most prevalent for more mobile workers as well as younger and foreign-born workers. Overall, the paper finds that employer concentration matters for wages in a context where skills are industry specific.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210280

Exploiting timing and locations of the four cases diagnosed in the country, we show that heightened concern about Ebola led to a lower Democratic vote share and lower turnout, despite no evidence of a general anti-incumbent effect (including President Obama). Voters displayed increasingly conservative attitudes on immigration, but not on other ideologically charged issues. Our findings indicate that emotional reactions can have a strong electoral impact, mediated by issues plausibly associated with the specific triggering factor.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220030
