Journal of Public Economics,2025,Beliefs about inequality and the nature of support for redistribution,"Aljosha Henkel, Ernst Fehr, Julien Senn and Thomas Epper","Do beliefs about inequality depend on distributive preferences? What is the joint role of preferences and beliefs about inequality for support for redistribution? We study these questions in a staggered experiment with a broadly representative sample of the Swiss population conducted in the context of a vote on a highly redistributive policy proposal. Our sample comprises a majority of inequality averse subjects, a sizeable group of altruistic subjects, and a minority of predominantly selfish subjects. Irrespective of preference types, individuals overestimate the extent of income inequality. An information intervention successfully corrects these large misperceptions for all types, but essentially does not affect aggregate support for redistribution. These results hide, however, important heterogeneity because the effects of beliefs about inequality for demand for redistribution are preference-dependent: only inequality averse individuals, but not the selfish and altruistic ones, significantly reduce their support for redistribution. These findings cast a new light on the seemingly puzzling result that, in the aggregate, large changes in beliefs about inequality often do not translate into changes in demand for redistribution.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000489
Journal of Public Economics,2025,Avoidance Responses to the Wealth Tax,"Mariona Mas-Montserrat, Jose M. Duran-Cabre and Alejandro Esteller-Moré","As a consequence of the Great Recession, the Spanish government reintroduced the Wealth Tax in 2011. We exploit the variation in wealth tax exposure to analyse taxpayers’ responses to this reintroduction. While facing higher wealth taxes did not discourage savings, results indicate that a 0.1 percentage point increase in the average tax rate leads to a reduction in taxable wealth of 3.21% over 4 years. In particular, the reduction in taxable wealth comes from taking advantage of exemptions, mostly business-related. Thus, the reintroduction induced avoidance. Taxpayers also take advantage of the limit on tax liability through a change in their asset and income composition. By far, this latter source of avoidance accounts for the greatest impact on tax revenues (92.6%). The impact of these avoidance strategies on revenue collected was far from negligible, since according to our estimates they represent a 2012-2015 revenue loss of 2.75 times the 2011 estimated wealth tax revenues. These findings should be useful to policymakers and administrations considering the implementation of a wealth tax, as they illustrate the pitfalls to be circumvented.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000490
Journal of Public Economics,2025,The employment effects of a pandemic wage subsidy,"Michael Smart, Matthew Kronberg, Josip Lesica and Huju Liu","We estimate causal effects of a pandemic-era wage subsidy in Canada on job losses and business closures. Our estimates use administrative microdata and a regression discontinuity strategy to estimate the effects of marginal changes in the wage subsidy rate. The estimated net wage elasticity of employment was 0.05 to 0.22, implying a small employment effect of the program and an estimated fiscal cost per job saved of more than $185,000 per year. Subsidy payments caused a small but persistent reduction in business closure rates during subsequent waves of the pandemic, and increased earnings of existing employees. In all, our results suggest the subsidies did little to preserve job matches, but played a greater role in the overall social insurance response to the pandemic.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000568
Journal of Public Economics,2025,Unemployment and tax design,Albert Jan Hummel,"This paper studies optimal income taxation in an environment where matching frictions generate a trade-off for workers between high wages and low unemployment risk. A higher marginal tax rate shifts the trade-off in favor of low unemployment risk, whereas a higher tax burden or unemployment benefit has the opposite effect. Changes in unemployment generate fiscal externalities, which modify optimal tax formulas. A calibration exercise to the US economy suggests that optimal marginal tax rates and employment taxes are hardly affected if unemployment responses to taxation are taken into account.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272500057X
Journal of Public Economics,2025,"Gulags, crime, and elite violence: Origins and consequences of the Russian mafia",Jakub Lonsky,"This paper studies the origins and consequences of the Russian mafia (vory-v-zakone). Using a unique web scraped dataset containing detailed biographies of more than 5,000 mafia leaders, I first show that the Russian mafia originated in the Soviet Gulag, and could be found near the camps’ initial locations throughout the 1990s Russia. Then, using an instrumental variable approach that exploits the proximity of the Russian mafia to the camps, I show that Russian communities with mafia presence in the 1990s experienced a dramatic rise in crime driven by elite violence which erupted shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The surge in violence was indiscriminate with respect to the victim type. Furthermore, the effect of mafia presence on elite violence was smaller in places where either all or none of the vory were ethnic Russians, suggesting some degree of ethnic conflict within the criminal organization itself.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000593
Journal of Public Economics,2025,Two decades of top income shares in Honduras,"Giselle Del Carmen, Santiago Garriga, Wilman Ponce and Thiago Scot","This study constructs distributional national accounts for Honduras from 2003 to 2019, integrating household surveys, administrative tax records, and national account aggregates. It assembles comprehensive data on formal income for high-income individuals, including information on corporate shareholders, which allows corporate profits to be assigned to their owners. Findings reveal a high and persistent inequality: the top 1 percent highest earners received approximately 30 percent of total pre-tax income, placing Honduras among the most unequal countries in the world. Capital income, mostly undistributed corporate profits, represent close to half of income for the top 0.1% of earners, highlighting its role in driving top income dynamics. Finally, using a panel of tax records, we also document that not only inequality is mostly unchanged over two decades, but the identity of top earners is also persistent — over half of those observed in the top 0.1% will stay there in a three year horizon.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272500060X

Policymakers often prefer future policies to be sustainable, but are tempted to invest less when being in office. We find the equilibrium number of signatory countries to be higher than when preferences are time consistent, especially when the political environment is unstable and polarized and the international spillovers are limited. This model also explains participation in treaties whose mandates do not vary with the coalition size and why the coalition will not unravel if, for example, the US exits the Paris Agreement.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000702

Focusing on the largest protest movement in recent history, the wave of Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd on 25 May 2020, we show that protests are more likely to spill over between US counties when they are more closely connected within the Facebook network. To identify causal effects, we develop an instrumental variable approach that exploits local Facebook outages as a source of exogenous variation in the structure of the online network.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000714

We develop a model with two competing technological paths and analyse various regulatory interventions. The optimal regulatory approach depends critically on the magnitude of potential harm relative to technological benefits. Our analysis reveals a motive to double down on harmful technologies in resource allocation across research paths, challenging common intuitions about diversification. We demonstrate that ex post regulatory instruments, particularly liability regimes, outperform ex ante restrictions in many scenarios. These insights have important implications for regulating emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, suggesting the need for informationally-responsive regulatory frameworks.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000738

This paper examines the experience with OregonSaves, the country’s longest-running plan, documenting that the program did prompt some participant savings. Median account balances were about $600 by mid-2023, but opt-out rates were above 50%, especially for the low-paid. Repeated exposure to the plan slightly reduced opt-outs, though withdrawals remained common. While modest savings accrued for many, it remains unclear whether these accounts will grow large enough to significantly increase retirement consumption.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000775

We introduce and experimentally study a game called the ‘helping game,’ where individuals unilaterally decide whether to incur a cost to help other team members when helping is a rivalrous good. We find that social ties have a strong positive effect on helping behavior. Individuals are more likely to help those with whom they are connected, but the likelihood of helping decreases as the social distance between individuals increases. Additionally, individuals randomly assigned to be more central in the network are more likely to help others.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000866

We show that fact-checking primarily affects the specific fake news it directly addresses, whereas media literacy helps to distinguish between false and correct information more generally, both immediately and around two weeks after the intervention. A plausible mechanism is that media literacy enables participants to critically evaluate social media postings, while fact-checking fails to enhance their skills as much. Our results promote media literacy as an effective tool to fight fake news, that is cheap, scalable, and easy-to-implement.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272500043X

We find that sick adults are willing to pay nearly twice as much per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) to reduce mortality risk as healthy adults, and that reducing the risk of serious illness is valued similarly to reducing the risk of mild illness. Our results provide a rational explanation for why people oppose a single threshold value for rationing care and why they invest less in prevention than in treatment.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000441

We use a difference-in-differences approach to show that this expansion drastically increased married women’s employment by nine percentage points, or 26 percent. This increase in labor force participation occurred among women who were immediately age-eligible, and among younger cohorts that would be eligible in the future. These results illuminate the capacity of workers to respond to financial incentives for labor participation, and the extent to which younger workers might be forward-looking as they respond to retirement incentives.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000507

This paper studies the consequences of an expansion of a universal preschool program in Japan. Exploiting regional differences in the program expansion, we estimate the policy effects using an event study model. Our estimates indicate that the preschool expansion significantly reduced juvenile violent arrests and the rate of teenage pregnancy, but did not increase high school enrollment or college enrollment rates. We suspect that improved non-cognitive skills can account for the reduction of risky behavior in adolescence.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000519
Journal of Public Economics,2025,Policy-advising competition and endogenous lobbies,Manuel Foerster and Daniel Habermacher,"We investigate Bertrand competition between experts in a policy-advising market. A policy-maker can either hire one of the experts or take the policy decision himself. The experts differ in policy competence and preferences and may either charge a fee or offer lobbying contributions. In equilibrium, the hired expert charges a fee if she has high policy competence and policy preferences are roughly aligned. Otherwise, the expert pays contributions—and thus acts as a lobbyist instead of as an advisor. Comparative statics show that more intense competition may even cause an expert previously hired at a positive price to engage in lobbying. Finally, we apply the model to competition between experts with different motives, reflecting the current debate about the role of professional consultants in advising governments. We show that the presence of able consultants may decrease social welfare if the policy issue is narrow and mainly concerns the policy-maker’s own voters. Our results give rise to alternative explanations for the empirical puzzle of why there is so little money in politics.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000520

Additionally, what role do politicians and media play in converting conflict exposure into votes? Using exogenous variation in conflict exposure in the home constituencies of deceased soldiers in India and a difference-in-differences regression, we find an increase in incumbent vote share in these constituencies, indicating a significant “rally around the flag” effect. Only conflicts receiving heightened attention in political speeches and media coverage exhibit this effect.

Journal of Public Economics,2025,Crowding in or crowding out? Evidence from discontinuity in the assignment of business R&D subsidies,Matěj Bajgar and Martin Srholec,"We employ a regression discontinuity design to study the effects of a flagship business R&D subsidy programme in the Czech Republic on R&D investment, patenting and economic performance of the supported firms. The R&D subsidies stimulated R&D expenditure in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) but not in large firms. In SMEs, public funding succeeded in crowding in private R&D investment, and 1 unit of public subsidy was associated with about 2.3 units of additional R&D expenditure. The positive effects on R&D expenditure of SMEs were sustained after the original projects ended, possibly thanks to subsequent subsidies from the same funding provider. Supported SMEs also saw their sales increase in the short term, but we do not observe any positive effects of the support on patenting, employment or longer-term sales and productivity. We find evidence that the subsidies crowded out private R&D expenditure in large firms and financing constraints played an important role in explaining the effect heterogeneity.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000556

We characterize efficiency properties of equilibrium. While the probability of success – the focus of previous theoretical analysis – may be strictly decreasing in group size, per-capita welfare is always increasing for every possible cost, strictly for sufficiently high costs. As group size increases, the expected utility of every member, regardless of their cost, converges to the expected utility of a member with the lowest possible cost, which is the same expected utility when there is no free rider problem, i.e., with only a single player in the game who has the lowest possible cost. Convergence, however, is slower than the convergence to zero of 1/n, so the total inefficiency diverges at infinity, even if the lowest cost is zero.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000581

Using a randomized controlled trial with over 10,000 Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries who voluntarily enrolled in the demonstration, we find precisely estimated null effects on earnings, income, and benefit amounts.

We study this trade-off by evaluating the recent controversial roll-out of the educative Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) that raises the entry requirement of public school teachers – the largest licensed profession in the US. Leveraging the quasi-experimental setting of different adoption timing by states, we analyze multiple data sources containing a national sample of prospective teachers and students of new teachers.

Journal of Public Economics,2025,What do bequests in married couples with a surviving spouse tell us about bequest motives?,Sean Fahle,"This paper studies the bequests that arise in married couples after the death of the first spouse. It provides the first systematic examination of these bequests using representative data from the United States on the actual (not intended or expected) bequests made to each of the couple’s children. I find that these bequests are divided among children very similarly to the bequests left by single individuals, which have been the near-exclusive focus of the literature. In both cases, I observe strong support for theories of bequests based on exchange and evolutionary psychology and no evidence for altruistic or dynastic models. Also novel to this paper, I document that different types of assets—residences, estates, and life insurance—exhibit different bequest patterns. While estates are typically equally divided, parents often divide life insurance and especially housing assets unequally, often leaving these assets to caregiving children. Selective disinheritance of certain children, particularly stepchildren, is common.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000313

We find that higher classroom poverty rates significantly reduce students’ academic performance, non-cognitive skills, and the likelihood of high school and college enrollment. These effects are particularly pronounced among students from lower-income families, while the presence of wealthier peers provides yields little benefit. Mechanisms driving these outcomes include diminished student motivation, poorer classroom climates, reduced parental involvement, and lower teacher attention.

Discordance between the inequality trends reached its highest rate in recent history. We introduce a framework to decompose differences in inequality trends. We find that 46% of post-2010 discordance in inequality trends is due to changing household composition, namely a larger share of young workers living with their parents and combining low (but increasing) personal earnings with high household incomes. The remaining discordance stems from increases in private income among higher-earning households and declining redistributive effects of government transfers. Declines in personal earnings inequality do not imply declines in household income inequality.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000350

This study examines whether these racial congruence effects apply to students who are older than their instructors. Using administrative data from a university with a significant population of non-traditional-aged students and focusing on required classes to eliminate strategic instructor choice possibility, we find that race matches are associated with improved grades for younger students but not for those of similar age or older relative to their professors. While the dataset predominantly features White student–teacher pairs, additional analyses yield similar patterns for minorities with some limitations for statistical power. The most potent effects are observed for non-traditional-aged Black students. Our findings suggest that the benefits of race-matched instructors for younger students may be driven by the role model channel, wherein older professors positively influence younger students’ academic performance through mentoring and motivation.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000532

When local jurisdictions have control over land use, such plants may not be built absent sufficient compensation. In this paper, we study the extent to which large plants’ property tax payments compensate for local harms and whether local governments internalize these fiscal benefits when making decisions about local industrial development. We first demonstrate that the tax base impact of plant openings are economically large, lead to increases in local expenditures and reductions in local property tax rates, and are valued by local residents. We next show suggestive evidence that limiting local jurisdictions’ access to property taxation reduces the likelihood that they will contain large industrial plants. Together, these results suggest that increases in the local tax base are an important benefit of large externality-producing projects that are valued by residents and that local governments may internalize the fiscal impact of these plants when making development decisions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002305

Journal of Public Economics,2025,Vote early and vote often? Detecting electoral fraud from the timing of 19th century elections,Francesco Ferlenga and Brian Knight,"This paper develops a new approach to detecting electoral fraud. Our context involves repeaters, individuals voting in multiple states in the U.S. during 19th Century Congressional Elections. Given high travel times, and the associated difficulties of voting in multiple states on the same day, we exploit the staggered introduction of holding federal elections on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November (1T1M). The key finding is that county-level turnout rates fell when the closest neighboring state coordinated on 1T1M. This result is consistent with 1T1M adoption making repeating more difficult. In terms of mechanisms, the pattern is stronger in states that had not yet adopted the secret ballot, consistent with the secret ballot itself reducing voter fraud. The results are also stronger in open-seat elections, which tend to be more competitive. Finally, the pattern is also driven by smaller population counties, consistent with repeaters particularly inflating turnout rates in these places.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000155

Journal of Public Economics,2025,Campaign contributions and legislative behavior: Evidence from U.S. Congress,Alberto Parmigiani,"What is the relationship between campaign contributions and legislative behavior of elected representatives? In this paper, I find that more concentrated donations negatively correlate with three costly legislative endeavors of members of Congress: bill sponsorship, speechmaking on the floor and witness appearances before committees. For bill sponsorship, the negative correlation is stronger for topics related to redistribution, such as health and social welfare bills. To interpret these results, I argue that a more skewed structure of contributions makes members of Congress more dependent on their top donors and thus potentially more inclined to represent their interests. By reciprocating favors to donors, by seeking to secure their continued financial support, or simply by enjoying more leisure time as a result of feeling secure in their financial backing, federal legislators are less active in activities related to the Congressional agenda and public policy. Overall, I contend that campaign contributions distort the incentives of elected representatives to allocate legislative effort in Congress.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000179

Journal of Public Economics,2025,Recession experiences during early adulthood shape prosocial attitudes later in life,"Jan Bietenbeck, Uwe Sunde and Petra Thiemann","This paper explores whether the experience of a recession during early adulthood shapes individuals’ prosocial attitudes. The analysis uses survey responses to experimentally validated questions that measure prosocial attitudes for approximately 64,000 respondents in 74 countries. The identification approach exploits variation in recession experiences across 75 different birth cohorts. We find that exposure to a recession during early adulthood is associated with lower levels of prosociality later in life. The effect only emerges for experiences during the impressionable years (age 18–25), mainly affects prosocial attitudes among men, and is orthogonal to the effect of experiences with democracy.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000258

Wanamaker,"Permissive abortion policy is thought to improve the average well-being of born children, as evidenced by recent studies based on 20th century US data. Using 19th century restrictive abortion policy, we demonstrate a more nuanced relationship between policy and child well-being. Despite increased birth rates among abortion-restricted cohorts, we find little evidence of changes in well-being at birth through the standard channel of child selection, consistent with predictions from a generalized model. However, children in these larger cohorts were more susceptible to mortality from infectious disease throughout childhood, implying different mechanisms linking abortion policy to child well-being.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000271

Journal of Public Economics,2025,Correlation in state and local tax changes,"Scott Baker, Pawel Janas and Lorenz Kueng","Empirical research in public economics, including our own, often uses variation in state and local taxes as an empirical laboratory to estimate causal relationships. A key concern is that other taxes might change at the same time. To assess this concern, we develop a dataset of state (1977–2022) and local (2000–2022) tax rates and revenue from personal income, corporate income, property, sales, and excise taxes. This new dataset generates two key results. First, we find that taxes of different types tend to co-move within a jurisdiction: a tax change of one type can more than double the likelihood of a second tax type changing in the same year. Local tax changes also co-move with tax changes enacted by the state they are located in. This positive correlation can upwardly bias elasticity estimates, but only moderately. For example, regressing state economic outcomes on the full set of state tax changes yields elasticities that are about 10%–30% smaller than those obtained from using a single tax type in isolation. Second, we document that the mix of taxes across state and local jurisdictions is very different, and that these differences have become more pronounced over time as jurisdictions have increasingly become reliant on the single tax type — sales, personal or corporate income tax — that was most prominent for them in the earliest part of our sample.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002111

Journal of Public Economics,2025,"Neighborhoods, perceived Inequality, and preferences for Redistribution: Evidence from Barcelona",Gerard Domènech-Arumí,"I study the effects of neighborhood-level inequality on perceived national-level inequality and preferences for redistribution. I construct a novel measure of local inequality using geolocated housing data and elicit perceptions and preferences from an original survey conducted in Barcelona. Local inequality is positively associated with perceived inequality but not with preferences for redistribution. I address endogenous sorting by exploiting quasi-random variation in exposure to new apartment buildings; this increases perceived inequality by 7% and has a positive but not statistically significant effect on demand for redistribution. Effects come from higher perceived income at the top. Local inequality shapes national-level inequality perceptions, but if it influences demand for redistribution, the effect is small. This work suggests that individuals extrapolate from their local environments when forming beliefs and highlights the importance of data granularity when studying neighborhood effects.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272400224X

Using tax records of individuals and businesses, we compare taxpayers with exogenously differing levels of exposure to the deduction, exploiting limitations within the statute. We find evidence of a 3 to 4 percent increase in reported business income eligible for the deduction during 2018 and 2019 for the more-exposed group relative to the less-exposed group. We also find some evidence of effects on specific hypothesized margins of adjustment. Partnerships reduced ineligible forms of compensation paid to owners by approximately 10 to 15 percent, in line with the incentives created by Section 199A, but S corporations did not reduce wages to owners.

Using administrative UI data merged with credit records and applications for Medicaid and SNAP, we show that UI withdrawal led to an increase in job-finding that was most pronounced among financially constrained individuals with limited available credit.

Journal of Public Economics,2025,Parents’ effective time endowment and divorce: Evidence from extended school days,"María Padilla-Romo, Cecilia Peluffo and Mariana Viollaz","Policies that extend the school day in elementary school provide an implicit childcare subsidy for families. As such, they can affect parents’ time allocation and family dynamics. This paper examines how extending the school day affects families by focusing on marriage dissolution. We exploit the staggered adoption of a policy that extended the availability of full-time elementary schools across different municipalities in Mexico. Using administrative data on divorces, we find that extending the school day by 3.5 h leads to a significant increase in divorce rates. Moreover, the effect grows with every year of municipalities’ exposure to full-time schooling. The effects are largely driven by municipalities with non-traditional social norms about marriage, divorce, and women’s priority to jobs, and by women in households with school-age children. Increased female labor force participation due to the availability of childcare is likely to be one of the mechanisms that relaxed restrictions on marriage dissolution.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272400238X

We propose that exposure to broad financial markets—where individuals place their assets in the hands of large groups of unfamiliar agents who nonetheless have the incentive and ability to promote their interests—can contribute to generalized trust. In a randomized controlled trial, we encourage Israelis to hold or trade stocks for up to seven weeks. We find that participation in financial markets increases the probability of expressing generalized trust by about 6 percentage points, equivalent to a quarter of the control group mean. The effects seem to be driven by political partisans along the left–right spectrum in Israel, and are robust to negative price changes. Thus, trust is not only a cause but can also be an effect of participation in financial markets.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000015

Exploiting exogenous variation in the timing of vaccinations, we find that vaccination increases psychological well-being (GHQ-12) by 0.12 standard deviations, compensating for one-half of the deterioration in mental health caused by the pandemic. This improvement persists for at least two months, and is linked to higher engagement in social activities and a decrease in the self-reported likelihood of contracting COVID-19. The main beneficiaries are individuals who became mentally distressed during the pandemic, supporting their prioritization in vaccination roll-outs. Conversely, individuals who harbored concerns about potential vaccine side effects show no improvement in psychological well-being upon vaccination, underscoring the importance of public confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy. Accounting for the improvement in psychological well-being increases the benefits of vaccination by around 50%.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000027
Journal of Public Economics,2025,The effect of a ‘None of the above’ ballot paper option on voting behavior and election outcomes,"Attila Ambrus, Ben Greiner and Anita Zednik","We study how an explicit blank vote option “None of the above” (NOTA) on the ballot paper affects the behavior of voters and political candidates as well as election results. In a series of survey and laboratory experiments we identify a tradeoff regarding making NOTA an explicit voting option. On the one hand it can reduce the vote share of candidates who voters consider as protest candidates, who often come from the extremes of the political spectrum, making it less likely that such a protest candidate wins the election. On the other hand, anticipating the above effect, establishment candidates may care less about the electorate when NOTA is on the ballot. Evidence on voters’ reaction to NOTA comes from two online survey experiments conducted in the weeks preceding the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the 2016 Austrian run-off election for president. Participants were subjected to either the original ballot paper or to a ballot paper where we added a NOTA option. We investigate the dynamic response of politicians to the presence of NOTA in a laboratory experiment in which an establishment candidate can decide between selfish and fair policy proposals and voters can choose between the establishment candidate and an inefficient protest option.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000039

We find asymmetric effects: conversations with like-minded individuals caused political views to become more extreme (ideological polarization); by contrast, conversations with contrary-minded individuals did not lead to a convergence of political views, but significantly reduced negative beliefs and attitudes toward ideological out-group members (affective polarization), while also improving perceived social cohesion more generally.

I use variation created by close elections to identify ideological shifts resulting from a change in party representation, holding voter preferences constant. I use candidate-level data from a voting advice application to estimate ideological positions, modeling candidates’ responses using item response theory to obtain measures of ideology that are comparable across election years. The results show that increased populist representation causes the ideological spectrum among other parties’ candidates in the municipality to become more concentrated. One additional seat for the populist party reduces the interquartile range of candidate positions by 9 %. While there is initial ideological convergence between mainstream and populist parties, it does not persist as the populist party continues to gain more seats.

Tax policy shifted rapidly at the beginning of the 20th century, but in many ways has remained remarkably stable over the past fifty years. Even as tax rates change frequently and vary widely across states, the degree of heterogeneity across states in rates and revenues is very similar over time. We document two key insights for empirical researchers using variation in tax policy for identification. First, tax changes do not appear to be driven by economic conditions, as neither the timing of tax changes nor tax rates themselves exhibit a predictable pattern around state recessions. Second, throughout the time period we study, many tax changes occur simultaneously, particularly for personal, corporate, and sales taxes. Because the coinciding changes are typically moving in the same direction, researchers should use caution when attributing effects to a specific type of tax, and we show that estimates can be sensitive to controlling for additional tax rates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002093

Evidence from central government transfers to French municipalities,Brice Fabre and Marc Sangnier,"This paper uses French data to simultaneously estimate the impact of two types of connections on government subsidies allocated to municipalities. Investigating different types of connection in a same setting helps to distinguish between the different motivations that could drive pork-barreling. We differentiate between municipalities where ministers held office before their appointment to the government and those where they lived as children. Exploiting ministers’ entries into and exits from the government, we show that municipalities where a minister was mayor receive 30% more investment subsidies when the politician they are linked to joins the government, and a similar size decrease when the minister departs. In contrast, we do not observe these outcomes for municipalities where ministers lived as children. These findings indicate that altruism toward childhood friends and family does not fuel pork-barreling, and suggest that altruism toward adulthood social relations or career concerns matter. We also present complementary evidence suggesting that observed pork-barreling is the result of soft influence of ministers, rather than of their formal control over the administration they lead.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002123
