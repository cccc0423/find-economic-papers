Journal of Public Economics,2020,Early evidence of the impacts of COVID-19 on minority unemployment,"Kenneth Couch, Robert Fairlie and Huanan Xu","This paper provides early evidence of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority unemployment in the United States. In the first month following March adoptions of social distancing measures by states, unemployment rose to 14.5% but a much higher 24.4% when we correct for potential data misclassification noted by the BLS. Using the official definition, unemployment in April 2020 among African-Americans rose by less than what would have been anticipated (to 16.6%) based on previous recessions, and the long-term ordering of unemployment across racial/ethnic groups was altered with Latinx unemployment (18.2%) rising for the first time to the highest among major groups. Difference-in-difference estimates confirm that the initial gap in unemployment between whites and blacks in April was not different than in periods prior to the pandemic; however, the racial gap expanded as unemployment for whites declined in the next two months but was largely stagnant for blacks. The initially large gap in unemployment between whites and Latinx in April was sustained in May and June as unemployment declined similarly for both groups. Non-linear decompositions show a favorable industry distribution partly protected black employment during the early stages of the pandemic, but that an unfavorable occupational distribution and lower average skills levels placed them at higher risk of job losses. An unfavorable occupational distribution and lower skills contributed to a sharply widened Latinx-white unemployment gap that moderated over time as rehiring occurred. These findings of disproportionate impacts on minority unemployment raise important concerns regarding lost earnings and wealth, and longer-term consequences of the pandemic on racial inequality in the United States.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301511
Journal of Public Economics,2020,The power of the IUD: Effects of expanding access to contraception through Title X clinics,"Andrea Kelly, Jason Lindo and Analisa Packham","We estimate the effect of Colorado's Family Planning Initiative, which provided funds to Title X clinics to offer long-acting reversible contraceptives to low-income women. We find substantial effects on childbearing, concentrated among women in zip codes within 7 miles of clinics: the initiative reduced births by approximately 20% for 15–19 year olds. We also estimate effects of extensive media coverage in 2014 and 2015, and find a substantial increase in LARC insertions, extended effects on births among 15–17 year olds living greater than 7 miles from clinics, and significant reductions in births among 20–24 and 25–29 year olds.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301523
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Disentangling retirement and savings responses,Maarten Lindeboom and Raymond Montizaan,"In January 2006, the Dutch government implemented a pension reform that substantially reduced the public pension wealth of workers born in 1950 or later. At the same time, a tax-facilitated savings plan was introduced that implied a large savings subsidy for all workers, irrespective of birth year. This paper uses linked administrative and survey data to assess the effect of the reform on the savings and retirement expectations and realizations of two virtually identical male cohorts that differ only in treatment status, the treated having been born in 1950 and the controls having been born in 1949. We show that retirement expectations are in line with realizations and that the reform increased the labor supply for the larger part of the workers, namely, those without sufficient means to substantially increase private savings to counter the effect of the reform. These workers have zero substitution rates between private and public wealth. On the other hand, there is a group of mostly high-wage workers who participate in the tax-facilitated savings plan and increase their private savings to fully counter the impact of the drop in public wealth. An unintended side effect of the introduction of the tax-facilitated savings plan is that high-wage earners who are not affected by the drop in pension wealth retire even sooner than initially planned.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301614
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Designed to fail: Effects of the default option and information complexity on student loan repayment,"James Cox, Daniel Kreisman and Susan Dynarski","Within five years of leaving school, 25% of student loan borrowers default on required minimum payments. These defaults are costly: they add to interest and penalties on loans and lower credit scores, which limits access to future credit and can adversely affect job prospects. We ask why so few student loan borrowers enroll in Income Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, which insure against default caused by low earnings. To do so we run an incentivized laboratory experiment using a facsimile of the government’s Student Loan Exit Counseling website. We test the roles information complexity, uncertainty about earnings, and the default option play. We find that switching the default option from the Standard plan with fixed minimum payments to an IDR with income-contingent minimum payments, and providing good information about earnings, can dramatically decrease choice of the risky Standard plan.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301626
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Consumption smoothing and debtor protections,Nathaniel Pattison,"Protections for defaulting debtors are a widely used form of consumption insurance. This paper evaluates the costs and benefits of this insurance, both inside and outside of bankruptcy. First, I show that consumption declines by 6% upon default, revealing a potential role for greater debtor protections to smooth consumption. Second, I use changes in states’ laws to estimate the impact of one type of debtor protection, asset exemptions, on repayment in default and interest rates. While higher exemptions smooth consumption by reducing collection in default, the interest rate cost is large relative to the benefits. Adapting a sufficient statistics formula from the literature, the estimates imply that the cost of additional exemption protection exceeds what debtors are willing to pay.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301705
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Trust and compliance to public health policies in times of COVID-19,Olivier Bargain and Ulugbek Aminjonov,"While degraded trust and cohesion within a country are often shown to have large socio-economic impacts, they can also have dramatic consequences when compliance is required for collective survival. We illustrate this point in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Policy responses all over the world aim to reduce social interaction and limit contagion. Using data on human mobility and political trust at regional level in Europe, we examine whether the compliance to these containment policies depends on the level of trust in policy makers prior to the crisis. Using a double difference approach around the time of lockdown announcements, we find that high-trust regions decrease their mobility related to non-necessary activities significantly more than low-trust regions. We also exploit country and time variation in treatment using the daily strictness of national policies. The efficiency of policy stringency in terms of mobility reduction significantly increases with trust. The trust effect is nonlinear and increases with the degree of stringency. We assess how the impact of trust on mobility potentially translates in terms of mortality growth rate.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301808
Journal of Public Economics,2020,"Fatal attraction? Extended unemployment benefits, labor force exits, and mortality","Andreas Kuhn, Stefan Staubli, Jean-Philippe Wuellrich and Josef Zweimüller","We estimate the causal effect of a permanent and premature exit from the labor force on mortality. To overcome the problem of negative health selection into retirement, we exploit a policy change in Austria's unemployment insurance system that allows older eligible workers to exit the labor force 3 years earlier relative to comparable non-eligible workers. Using administrative data with precise information on mortality and retirement, we find that the policy change induces eligible men (women) to retire 5.5 (8.5) months earlier. Instrumental variable estimates show that for men retiring one year earlier causes a 5.5% increase in the risk of premature death and a 2.2 months reduction in the age at death but has no significant effect for women.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301483
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Do place-based tax incentives create jobs?,"Hyejin Ku, Uta Schönberg and Ragnhild C. Schreiner","In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of place-based payroll taxes in stimulating local employment by exploiting a unique policy setting in Norway, where a system of geographically differentiated payroll taxes was suddenly abolished due to an EU regulation. The reform was enforced independently of the regional labor market developments, creating arguably exogenous variation in the payroll tax rates that firms in different local labor markets faced over time. We find evidence of partial shifting of payroll tax increases on to worker wages as well as a significant decline in local employment. These findings suggest that in settings with some degrees of wage rigidity, place-based payroll tax incentives can be effective in stimulating local employment.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301665
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Inequality in the joint distribution of consumption and time use,"Jeehoon Han, Bruce D. Meyer and James Sullivan","This paper examines inequality in both leisure and consumption over the past four decades. Using time use surveys stretching from 1975 to 2016, we estimate the distribution of leisure time conditional on hours worked and other individual level and family level characteristics. We show that these characteristics, especially when including work hours, explain most of the long run variation in leisure. We then use these estimates to predict the distribution of leisure using work hours and other characteristics in the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a survey that also provides detailed information on consumption. The advantage of this approach is that it gives us measures of consumption and leisure at the family level within a single data source. Combining consumption and leisure allows us to characterize more accurately changes in the distribution of well-being. We find that leisure time is highest for families at the bottom of the consumption distribution, and typically declines monotonically as consumption rises. However, the consumption-leisure gradient is small. We find noticeable differences across family types, with the gradient being largest for single parent families and single individuals and smallest for families with a head age 65 or older. The negative relationship between consumption and leisure appears strongest during the period around the Great Recession. We find that including both leisure and consumption, as opposed to just consumption, in a measure of economic well-being results in less inequality. The negative association between leisure and consumption is a sufficient condition for this result. However, the degree to which leisure inequality offsets consumption inequality depends on the valuation of leisure.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301689
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Inheritance taxation and wealth effects on the labor supply of heirs,"Fabian Kindermann, Lukas Mayr and Dominik Sachs","The taxation of bequests can have a positive impact on the labor supply of heirs through wealth effects. This leads to an increase in labor income tax revenue on top of direct bequest tax revenue. We first show in a theoretical model that a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation, based on existing estimates for the reduction in earnings after wealth transfers, fails: the marginal propensity to earn out of unearned income is not a sufficient statistic for the calculation of this effect because (i) heirs anticipate the reduction in net bequests and adjust their labor supply already prior to inheriting, and (ii) when bequest receipt is stochastic, even those who ex post end up not inheriting anything respond ex ante to the implied change in their distribution of net bequests. We quantitatively elaborate the size of the overall revenue effect due to labor supply changes of heirs by using a state-of-the-art life-cycle model that we calibrate to the German economy. Besides the joint distribution of income and inheritances, quasi-experimental evidence regarding the size of wealth effects on labor supply is a key target for this calibration. We find that for each Euro of bequest tax revenue the government mechanically generates, it obtains an additional 9 cents of labor income tax revenue (in net present value) through higher labor supply of (non-)heirs.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301896
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Inequality in socio-emotional skills: A cross-cohort comparison,"Orazio Attanasio, Richard Blundell, Gabriella Conti and Giacomo Mason","We examine changes in inequality in socio-emotional skills very early in life in two British cohorts born 30 years apart. We construct comparable scales using two validated instruments for the measurement of child behaviour and identify two dimensions of socio-emotional skills: ‘internalising’ and ‘externalising’. Using recent methodological advances in factor analysis, we establish comparability in the inequality of these early skills across cohorts, but not in their average level. We document for the first time that inequality in socio-emotional skills has increased across cohorts, especially for boys and at the bottom of the distribution. We also formally decompose the sources of the increase in inequality and find that compositional changes explain half of the rise in inequality in externalising skills. On the other hand, the increase in inequality in internalising skills seems entirely driven by changes in returns to background characteristics. Lastly, we document that socio-emotional skills measured at an earlier age than in most of the existing literature are significant predictors of health and health behaviours. Our results show the importance of formally testing comparability of measurements to study skills differences across groups, and in general point to the role of inequalities in the early years for the accumulation of health and human capital across the life course.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300359
Journal of Public Economics,2020,How much to save? Decision costs and retirement plan participation,"Jacob Goldin, Tatiana Homonoff, Richard Patterson and William Skimmyhorn","Deciding how much to save for retirement can be complicated. Drawing on a field experiment conducted with the Department of Defense, we study whether such complexity depresses participation in an employer-sponsored retirement saving plan. We find that simplifying one dimension of the enrollment decision, by highlighting a potential rate at which non-participants might contribute, increases participation in the plan. Similar communications that did not include a highlighted rate yield smaller effects. The results highlight how reducing complexity on the intensive margin of a decision (how much to contribute) can affect extensive margin behavior (whether to contribute at all) in a setting of policy interest.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301110

Although we find that total crime decreased by 17% relative to neighboring non-treated blocks, these main effects are not the complete story. We find evidence of treatment spillovers in blocks closest to treated areas, but we also uncover cross-crime substitution within treated blocks, intertemporal reallocation of crime to non-monitored periods, and spatial displacement of crime into areas farther away from treated blocks. Our estimates of the benefit-cost ratio associated with each additional civilian-year of community monitoring are much larger than traditional estimates of each additional police officer-year.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301146

Political leaders and media outlets on the right and left have sent divergent messages about the severity of the crisis, which could impact the extent to which Republicans and Democrats engage in social distancing and other efforts to reduce disease transmission. We develop a simple model of a pandemic response with heterogeneous agents that clarifies the causes and consequences of heterogeneous responses. We use location data from a large sample of smartphones to show that areas with more Republicans engaged in less social distancing, controlling for other factors including public policies, population density, and local COVID cases and deaths. We then present new survey evidence of significant gaps at the individual level between Republicans and Democrats in self-reported social distancing, beliefs about personal COVID risk, and beliefs about the future severity of the pandemic.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301183

To generate exogenous variation in beliefs, we then provide respondents in the treatment group with research evidence showing no adverse labor market impacts of immigration. Treated respondents update their beliefs and become more supportive of immigration, as measured by self-reported policy views and petition signatures. Treatment effects also persist in an obfuscated follow-up study.

Journal of Public Economics,2020,Can access to health care mitigate the effects of temperature on mortality?,Jamie T. Mullins and Corey White,"Understanding the sources of heterogeneity in the health effects of environmental exposure is critical for optimal policy design. Differential access to health care is commonly cited as a potential source of such heterogeneity. We test this hypothesis in a causal framework by combining random year-to-year fluctuations in local temperatures with variation in access to primary care services resulting from the idiosyncratic roll-out of Community Health Centers (CHCs) across US counties in the 1960s and 1970s. We find that the improved access to primary care services provided by CHCs moderates the heat-mortality relationship by 14.2%, but we find little evidence that CHC access mitigates the harmful effects of cold. In a supplementary analysis we find evidence that acute care – in contrast to primary care – may be especially effective at mitigating the cold-mortality relationship. Our results suggest that differential access to health care does contribute to observed heterogeneity in environmental health damages, and that improving access to primary care may be a useful means of mitigating harm from a warming climate.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301237

We allow criminals to choose between a horizontal (partnership) and a vertical (hierarchical) organization structure, and we study how this choice affects the optimal leniency granted by a benevolent Legislator whose aim is to minimize crime. We show that the optimal amnesty with an endogenous organizational choice is less lenient than that granted when the policy targets vertical organizations only. In the equilibrium, partnerships coexist with vertical organizations.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301262
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Real-time price indices: Inflation spike and falling product variety during the Great Lockdown,Xavier Jaravel and Martin O'Connell,"We characterize inflation dynamics during the Great Lockdown using scanner data covering millions of transactions for fast-moving consumer goods in the United Kingdom. We show that there was a significant and widespread spike in inflation. First, aggregate month-to-month inflation was 2.4% in the first month of lockdown, a rate over 10 times higher than in preceding months. Over half of this increase stems from reduced frequency of promotions. Consumers' purchasing power was further eroded by a reduction in product variety. Second, 96% of households have experienced inflation in 2020, while in prior years around half of households experienced deflation. Third, there was inflation in most product categories, including those that experienced output falls. Only 13% of product categories experienced deflation, compared with over half in previous years. While market-based measures of inflation expectations point to disinflation or deflation, these findings indicate a risk of stagflation should not be ruled out. We hope our approach can serve as a template to facilitate rapid diagnosis of inflation risks during economic crises, leveraging scanner data and appropriate price indices in real-time.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301341
Journal of Public Economics,2020,The impact of COVID-19 on student experiences and expectations: Evidence from a survey,"Esteban Aucejo, Jacob French, Maria Paola Ugalde Araya and Basit Zafar","In order to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher education, we surveyed approximately 1500 students at one of the largest public institutions in the United States using an instrument designed to recover the causal impact of the pandemic on students' current and expected outcomes. Results show large negative effects across many dimensions. Due to COVID-19: 13% of students have delayed graduation, 40% have lost a job, internship, or job offer, and 29% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly heterogeneous. One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4 hours per week due to COVID-19, while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This heterogeneity often followed existing socioeconomic divides. Lower-income students are 55% more likely than their higher-income peers to have delayed graduation due to COVID-19. Finally, we show that the economic and health related shocks induced by COVID-19 vary systematically by socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining the large (and heterogeneous) effects of the pandemic.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301353
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Human mobility restrictions and the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"Hanming Fang, Long Wang and Yang Yang","We quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions, particularly the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, on the containment and delay of the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We employ difference-in-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. The lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflows to Wuhan by 76.98%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.31%, and within-Wuhan movements by 55.91%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities – the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak – on the destination cities' new infection cases. We also provide evidence that the enhanced social distancing policies in the 98 Chinese cities outside Hubei province were effective in reducing the impact of the population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV in the destination cities. We find that in the counterfactual world in which Wuhan were not locked down on January 23, 2020, the COVID-19 cases would be 105.27% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province.

We find that between April and July 2020, 76% of workers eligible for regular Unemployment Compensation have statutory replacement rates above 100%, meaning that they are eligible for benefits which exceed lost wages. The median statutory replacement rate is 145%. We also compute comprehensive replacement rates, which account for employer provided non-wage compensation and differential tax treatment of labor income and UI. 69% of UI-eligible unemployed have comprehensive replacement rates above 100% and the median comprehensive replacement rate is 134%.

Second, peak amplitudes differ greatly – from a 35% rise for the model-based measure of US economic uncertainty (relative to January 2020) to a 20-fold rise in forecaster disagreement about UK growth. Third, time paths also differ: Implied volatility rose rapidly from late February, peaked in mid-March, and fell back by late March as stock prices began to recover. In contrast, broader measures of uncertainty peaked later and then plateaued, as job losses mounted, highlighting differences between Wall Street and Main Street uncertainty measures.

Journal of Public Economics,2020,Misaligned incentives and the scale of incarceration in the United States,Aurélie Ouss,"The incarceration rate has increased substantially in the United States between the 1980s and the 2000s. In this paper, I explore an institutional explanation for this growth: the fact that costs of incarceration are not fully internalized. Typically, prison is paid for at the state level, but county employees (such as judges, prosecutors or probation officers) determine time spent in custody. I exploit a natural experiment that shifted the cost burden of juvenile incarceration from state to counties, keeping overall costs and responsibilities unchanged. This resulted in a stark drop in incarceration, and no increase in arrests, suggesting an over-use of prison when costs are not internalized. The large magnitude of the change suggests that misaligned incentives in criminal justice may be a significant contributor to the current levels of incarceration in the United States.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301493

Using a regression discontinuity design, we compare the employment outcomes of individuals connected to the winner vis-à-vis those connected to the runner-up in close mayoral races in Ecuador. Among candidates to local councils who lose their bid, the probability of getting a job in the municipality increases tenfold when their own party's mayoral nominee is elected. The effect is very strong for low-ranking positions, which suggests that it is the result of political patronage. Three additional results shed light on where patronage is more likely to emerge. First, the effect is stronger in poorer municipalities, where public sector jobs are more valuable. Second, benefits go largely to politicians better positioned within the party structure. Third, the effect is concentrated among younger mayors, who have a longer career ahead of them to capitalize clientelist arrangements.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272030150X

This paper examines the consequences of just failing a particularly important high stakes national examination taken at the end of compulsory schooling in England. It uses unique administrative data, including full information on both initial and regraded exam marks, to show that students of the same ability have significantly different educational trajectories depending on whether they just pass or fail this exam. Three years later, students who just fail to achieve the required threshold have a lower probability of entering an upper-secondary high-level academic or vocational track and of starting tertiary education. Those who fail to pass the threshold are also more likely to drop out of education by age 18, without some form of employment. The moderately high effects of just passing or failing to pass the threshold in this high-stakes exam has high potential long-term consequences for those affected.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300888
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Value for money? Vote-buying and politician accountability,"Jessica Leight, Dana Foarta, Rohini Pande and Laura Ralston","The prevalence of vote-buying is widely identified as a cause of poor governance in the developing world; potential mechanisms for this relationship include the selection of lower quality politicians, and the reduced accountability experienced by politicians once elected. In this paper, we present the first experimental evidence in support of the second channel of reduced accountability. Using data from laboratory experiments conducted in the U.S. and Kenya, we find that vote payments reduce voters' willingness to hold politicians accountable: holding fixed politician identity, voters who receive payments are less willing to punish the politician for rent-seeking, and this reduction in punishment is larger in magnitude when payments are widely targeted. Unsurprisingly, the politician then engages in a higher level of rent-seeking.

Our existence proof applies under extremely general assumptions about individual preferences. When we restrict preferences to have the widely-used-in-the-selection-markets-literature quasilinear form, we characterize the properties of this equilibrium by developing a simple and computationally efficient numerical method for constructing it. Applying this method, we show in a natural setting how one would compute the equilibrium allocation, potentially facilitating empirical work using the MWS equilibrium. We illustrate this empirical application in the context of policy interventions and show that the welfare implications of a coverage mandate critically hinge on whether the market implements a constrained efficient allocation like the MWS equilibrium or a constrained inefficient allocation like in Azevedo and Gottlieb (2017).",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301018
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Spillover effects of stricter immigration policies,"Cristina Bratu, Matz Dahlberg, Mattias Engdahl and Till Nikolka","We provide evidence for the existence of spillover effects of national immigration policies by estimating the effect of stricter family reunification rules in Denmark on migration behavior. We reach three main conclusions. Using Danish register data, we first show that stricter rules for reunification led to a clear and significant increase in emigration of Danish citizens with immigrant background. Most of the emigrants left Denmark for Sweden, a neighboring country in which reunification was possible. Next, using Swedish register data, we find that affected individuals emigrating to Sweden actually came for family formation purposes. Finally, we demonstrate that not all individuals that came to Sweden to reunite with a partner stayed in the country; of those leaving, return migration to Denmark was most common. Our results indicate that potential spillover effects from national migration policies should be taken into account when forming migration policy.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301031

Employing newly available bilateral data on cross-border deposits, we find that the CRS induced a reduction of 11.5% in cross-border deposits parked in tax havens. However, despite the 4000 bilateral information exchange relations created under the CRS, deposit relocation is still an option for secrecy-seeker.

Exploiting the temporal and geographic variation in the implementation of interior immigration enforcement from 2005 to 2017, we find that a one standard deviation increase in enforcement raises Mexican non-citizens' likelihood of marrying a U.S. citizen by 3 to 7%.

The analysis adds to a growing literature examining how immigrants respond to tightened enforcement and, importantly, sheds light on the recent growth of intermarriage among Mexican immigrants.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301067

This paper provides evidence that information frictions and the “first-come, first-served” design of the PPP program skewed its resources towards larger firms and may have permanently reduced its effectiveness. Using new daily survey data on small businesses in the U.S., we show that the smallest businesses were less aware of the PPP and less likely to apply. If they did apply, the smallest businesses applied later, faced longer processing times, and were less likely to have their application approved. These frictions may have mattered, as businesses that received aid report fewer layoffs, higher employment, and improved expectations about the future.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301080

Similar distortions are created by attribute-based regulations. This paper demonstrates that, despite these distortions, output and attribute-based standards can always yield strictly greater expected welfare than “flat” emission standards given uncertainty in demand for output (or attributes), assuming locally constant marginal damages. For fuel economy standards, the welfare-maximizing amount of attribute or mileage-basing is likely small relative to current policy. For the electricity sector, however, an intensity standard may yield greater expected welfare than a flat standard.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301109

Hernández-Pizarro, Catia Nicodemo and Guillem López Casasnovas","This paper examines the unintended strategic effects of non-linear incentives in public policies. A system of health care subsidies structured into discrete intervals may lead to strategic behaviour. We provide new evidence on this issue, focusing on a case where strategic actions are taken by healthcare providers (HCPs). We show that HCPs adjust the score of claimants in long-term care needs assessments, allowing claimants to access higher levels of care benefits. This adjustment does not bring any pecuniary gain for HCPs. In a quasi-natural experimental setting –the implementation of Spanish long-term care (LTC)– we show that the distribution of the claimants' needs includes kinks around the thresholds set for the LTC system. These kinks reveal that healthcare providers adopt prosocial behaviour, helping claimants jump to a higher level of benefits without discriminating by health status, residence, or gender. By developing a new non-parametric estimator, we prove that these adjustments increase the public LTC spending, which is equivalent to moving thresholds to the left. The additional cost per adjusted claimant per annum is approximately 1000 euro on average. Finally, we also explore empirically whether the number of thresholds could affect such behaviour, by exploiting a reform that eliminated some thresholds. We find that the lower number of thresholds is associated with an increase of adjustment around the thresholds that remain.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301122

Because tenants are always fully informed about their total housing costs in the landlord-pay regime, the effect of energy cost changes on tenant turnover, rents, and efficiency investment should differ between the two payment regimes under asymmetric information but not symmetric information. Using energy cost variation in the form of changes in relative heating fuel prices, I find evidence that tenants are uninformed about energy costs.

Research demonstrates that children of parents with lower educational attainment and children of migrant parents may benefit the most from day care, making it important to understand why such enrolment gaps exist. We use a unique data set that records both parental demand for day care and actual usage to investigate determinants using complementary decomposition and quasi-experimental analyses. Our decomposition shows that (a) differences in demand are important but do not fully explain the enrolment gaps, (b) large shares of the gaps are unexplained, especially for migrant parents, and (c) the heterogeneous effects of access barriers (shortages and fees) may explain some of the remaining gaps. Our quasi-experimental design finds that reducing shortages significantly decreases the enrolment gap by parental education but not by parental migrant status. Similarly, using the synthetic control method we show that a reduction of fees reduces only the gap by parental education.

This study examines an unexplored consequence of COVID-19 school closures: the broken link between child maltreatment victims and the number one source of reported maltreatment allegations—school personnel. Using current, county-level data from Florida, we estimate a counterfactual distribution of child maltreatment allegations for March and April 2020, the first two months in which Florida schools closed. While one would expect the financial, mental, and physical stress due to COVID-19 to result in additional child maltreatment cases, we find that the actual number of reported allegations was approximately 15,000 lower (27%) than expected for these two months. We leverage a detailed dataset of school district staffing and spending to show that the observed decline in allegations was largely driven by school closures. Finally, we discuss policy implications of our findings for the debate surrounding school reopenings and suggest a number of responses that may mitigate this hidden cost of school closures.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301225

Modeling them as a shock to the extensive margin of labor adjustment – a rise in separations – produces large and persistent negative effects on output, unemployment and welfare, raises precautionary savings and lowers inflation, in line with early evidence about inflation dynamics. Modeling lockdowns as a shock to the intensive margin – a fall in labor utilization – produces small and short-lived macroeconomic and welfare effects, and implies a counterfactual rise in inflation. Conditional on a lockdown (separation) shock, raising public spending or extending UI benefits by large amounts is much more effective in stimulating the economy than during normal times. Quantitatively however, the ability of such policies to flatten the output and unemployment curves remains limited, even though these policies can alleviate a reasonable share of the aggregate welfare losses from the lockdown.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301249

The shutdown cut paychecks by 40% for affected employees, which was recovered within 2 weeks. Because the shutdown affected only the timing of payments, it provides a distinctive experiment allowing estimates of the response to a liquidity shock holding income constant. Spending dropped sharply, implying a naïve estimate of 58 cents less spending for every dollar of lost liquidity. This estimate overstates the consumption response. While many individuals had low liquid assets, they used multiple sources of short-term liquidity to smooth consumption. Sources of short-term liquidity include delaying recurring payments such as for mortgages and credit card balances.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727271830118X

An analytically tractable version of the model without intertemporal trade is used to characterize and quantify the salient trade-offs in tax design.

Journal of Public Economics,2020,What can we learn about household consumption expenditure from data on income and assets?,"Lasse Eika, Magne Mogstad and Ola Vestad","A major difficulty faced by researchers who want to study the consumption and savings behavior of households is the lack of reliable panel data on household expenditures. One possibility is to use surveys that follow the same households over time, but such data are rare and they typically have small sample sizes and face significant measurement issues. An alternative approach is to use the accounting identity that total household spending is equal to income plus capital gains minus the change in wealth over the period. The goal of this paper is to examine the advantages and difficulties of using this accounting identity to construct a population panel data with information on household expenditure. To derive such measures of consumption expenditure, we combine several data sources from Norway over the period 1994–2014. This allows us to link tax records on income and wealth to other administrative data with information on financial and real estate transactions. Using this data, we derive household expenditure from the accounting identity, before assessing the sensitivity of this measure of consumption expenditure to the assumptions made and the data used. We then compare our measures of household expenditure to those reported in expenditure surveys and to the aggregates from national accounts. We also illustrate the research opportunities arising from the derived measures of consumption expenditure through two applications: the first is an examination of how relative wage movements among birth cohorts and education groups affected the distribution of household expenditure, while the second is a study of the transmission of income shocks to household consumption.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272030027X

Their widely-cited estimates are based on proprietary house price and proprietary expenditure data and therefore not easily replicable. We use alternative data on a subset of non-durable goods and on house prices, which are more easily accessible, to replicate their study. When estimating their same specification on our data, we obtain values for the elasticity of expenditures to the housing net worth shock that are virtually indistinguishable from theirs. However, our robustness analyses with respect to alternative model specifications yield more nuanced conclusions about the separate roles of house prices and initial housing exposure/leverage for the drop in expenditures. Moreover, the estimated elasticity is consistent, theoretically and quantitatively, with a simple calibrated model with wealth effects where leverage and credit constraints play no role.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300402

Our job vacancy data allow us to track the economy at disaggregated geography and by detailed occupation and industry. We find that job vacancies collapsed in the second half of March. By late April, they had fallen by over 40%. To a first approximation, this collapse was broad based, hitting all U.S. states, regardless of the timing of stay-at-home policies. UI claims and BLS employment data also largely match these patterns. Nearly all industries and occupations saw contraction in postings and spikes in UI claims, with little difference depending on whether they are deemed essential and whether they have work-from-home capability. Essential retail, the “front line” job most in-demand during the current crisis, took a much smaller hit, while leisure and hospitality services and non-essential retail saw the biggest collapses. This set of facts suggests the economic collapse was not caused solely by the stay-at-home orders, and is therefore unlikely to be undone simply by lifting them.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272030102X

Exploiting differential timing in the announcements of restaurant and bar limitations, non-essential business closures, stay-at-home orders, large-gatherings bans, school closures, and emergency declarations, we leverage the high-frequency search data to separately identify the effects of multiple NPIs that were introduced around the same time. We then describe a set of assumptions under which proxy outcomes can be used to estimate a causal parameter of interest when data on the outcome of interest are limited. Using this method, we quantify the share of overall growth in unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic that was directly due to each of these state-level NPIs. We find that between March 14 and 28, restaurant and bar limitations and non-essential business closures can explain 6.0% and 6.4% of UI claims respectively, while the other NPIs did not directly increase own-state UI claims. This suggests that most of the short-run increase in UI claims during the pandemic was likely due to other factors, including declines in consumer demand, local policies, and policies implemented by private firms and institutions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301213

We provide subjects with a set of hypothetical individuals' incomes and wealth and elicit subjects' preferred (absolute) tax bill for each individual. Our method allows us to unobtrusively map both income earned and accumulated wealth into desired tax levels. Our regression results yield roughly linear desired tax rates on income of about 14%. Respondents' suggested tax rates indicate positive desired wealth taxation. When we distinguish between sources of wealth we find that, in line with recent theoretical arguments, subjects' implied tax rate on wealth is 3% when the source of wealth is inheritance, far higher than the 0.8% rate when wealth is from savings.

We find that providing parents with specific information changes parenting behavior and reduces children's internet use by 6–10%. Evidence from heterogeneity analysis and machine learning algorithms suggest that this information substitutes for the presence of parents at home and complements parents' capacity to be involved in their children's lives.

I develop an objective measure of the tone of climate change coverage by creating an index that builds on Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010), using phrase frequency analysis to compare newspaper text with the UN's IPCC reports and the Heartland Institute's skeptical response, each of which are lengthy official reports with clear stances on climate change. I also develop a measure of potential advertising from the auto industry, using national shocks to advertising at the manufacturer level weighted by previous advertising at the newspaper level. The empirical analysis shows that this potential advertising allows firms to capture newspapers: within-newspaper, the potential for advertising from car manufacturers shifts the tone of coverage towards skepticism. I also find suggestive evidence that potential advertising reduces the overall quantity of coverage of climate change.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300839

Using administrative data of daily school attendance I present causal evidence of complementarities in school skipping decisions within student networks in national protest days. Identification relies on partially overlapping networks and within school exposure to an inaugural college protest. A structural estimation of a coordination game with incomplete information also supports the existence of these complementarities. Importantly, I show that skipping school imposed significant educational costs on students but it also helped to shift votes towards non-traditional candidates more aligned with their demands.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300840

We show suggestive evidence that after the capital gains tax increase, resale transactions exhibit more bunching above 5 years of holding period, but the responses are small and imprecisely estimated. More importantly, using precise information of both the actual transaction price and the reported price to the tax authority, we find that tax evasion, measured by the difference between the two prices, becomes 23.3% higher. We also document that the policy has strong heterogeneous effects, whereby cash buyers are 8.4% more likely to buy a house than buyers who need financing after the policy. This is mainly because financing buyers prefer a higher reported price (and so less tax evasion) to secure higher bank loans but cash buyers do not have such concern.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300864
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Adjustment cost and incentives to work: Evidence from a disability insurance program,Arezou Zaresani,"How important is adjustment cost for individuals who face a change in work incentives induced by a policy change? I provide the first estimate of adjustment cost in the context of a Disability Insurance (DI) program by exploiting a policy change that increased work incentives by increasing the exemption threshold. I use bunching at the thresholds to estimate adjustment cost and earnings elasticity. The estimates of adjustment cost are quite sizeable and heterogeneous. The estimates of earnings elasticity, from both static and dynamic models, are larger than the elasticity estimated with no adjustment cost, suggesting that adjustment cost attenuates the responses to work incentives. Policies designed to increase labor supply will work if the work incentives are large enough to offset the adjustment cost. Accounting for adjustment cost then might explain the disparate findings on the effects of an increase in work incentives on the labor supply of beneficiaries of DI programs.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300876
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Costs of energy efficiency mandates can reverse the sign of rebound,Don Fullerton and Chi Ta,"Improvements in energy efficiency reduce the cost of consuming services from household cars and appliances and can result in a positive rebound effect that offsets part of the direct energy savings. We use a general equilibrium model to derive analytical expressions that allow us to compare rebound effects from a costless technology shock (CTS) to those from a costly energy efficiency standard (EES). We decompose each total effect on the use of energy into a direct efficiency effect, direct rebound effect, and indirect rebound effect. We show which factors determine the sign and magnitude of each. Rebound from a CTS is generally positive, as in prior literature, but we also show how a pre-existing EES can negate the direct energy savings from the CTS – leaving only the positive rebound effect on energy use. Then we analyze increased stringency of an EES, and we show exactly when the increased costs reverse the sign of rebound. Using plausible parameter values in this model, we find that indirect effects can outweigh the direct effects captured in partial equilibrium models, and that the total rebound from a costly EES can be negative.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272030089X

We measure the size of the interstate trade generated by state-level differences in legal status with a natural experiment: Oregon allowed stores to sell marijuana for recreational use on October 1, 2015, next to Washington where stores had been selling recreational marijuana since July 2014. Using administrative data covering the universe of Washington's sales and a differences-in-discontinuities approach, we find retailers along the Oregon border experienced a 36% decline in sales immediately after Oregon's market opened. We investigate the home location of recent online reviewers of marijuana retailers and find similar cross-border patterns. By the end of Washington's 2018 fiscal year, our results imply that Washington had earned between $44 million and $75 million in tax revenue from cross-border shoppers.

Journal of Public Economics,2020,Opinion dynamics via search engines (and other algorithmic gatekeepers),Fabrizio Germano and Francesco Sobbrio,"Ranking algorithms are the information gatekeepers of the Internet era. We develop a stylized model to study the interplay between a ranking algorithm and individual clicking behavior. We consider a search engine that uses an algorithm based on popularity and on personalization. The analysis shows the presence of a feedback effect, whereby individuals clicking on websites indirectly provide information about their private signals to successive searchers through the popularity-ranking algorithm. Accordingly, when individuals provide sufficiently positive feedback to the ranking algorithm, popularity-based rankings tend to aggregate information while personalization acts in the opposite direction. Moreover, we find that, under fairly general conditions, popularity-based rankings generate an advantage of the fewer effect: fewer websites reporting a given signal attract relatively more traffic overall. This highlights a novel, ranking-driven channel that can potentially explain the diffusion of misinformation, as websites reporting incorrect information may attract an amplified amount of traffic precisely because they are few.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300529

While this evidence is relevant and important for studying the concentration of economic power, it is incomplete as an informational basis for analysing inequality in the income distribution as a whole. This paper proposes a non-parametric approach for estimating inequality in the overall distribution of income on the basis of tabular data from different sources, some in a highly aggregated form. The proposed approach is applied to Norway, for which rich historical data exist. We find evidence of very high income inequality from the late nineteenth century until the eve of World War II, followed by a rapid equalization until the 1950s. Income inequality remained low during the post-war period but has increased steadily since the 1980s. Estimates of a measure of affluence demonstrate that overall inequality has largely been governed by changes in the top half of the distribution and in the ratio between the mean incomes of the lower and upper halves of the population.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300608

We revisit this idea in the context of highway bottlenecks. We propose an empirical test using an event study design to measure changes in highway capacity at the onset of queue formation. We apply this test to three highway bottlenecks in California for which detailed data on traffic flows and vehicles speeds are available. We find no evidence of a reduction in highway capacity at any of the three sites during periods of high demand. Across sites and specifications we have sufficient statistical power to rule out even small reductions in highway capacity. This lack of evidence of hypercongestion stands in sharp contrast to most previous studies and informs core models in urban and transportation economics.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272030061X
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Measuring economic efficiency using inverse-optimum weights,Nathaniel Hendren,"This paper provides a method to measure the traditional Kaldor-Hicks notion of “economic efficiency” when taxes affect behavior. In contrast to traditional unweighted surplus, measuring efficiency requires weighting individual benefits (or surplus) by the marginal cost to the government of providing a $1 transfer at each income level. These weights correspond to the solution to the “inverse-optimum” program in the optimal tax literature: they are the social planning weights that would rationalize the status quo tax schedule as optimal. I estimate the weights using the universe of US income tax returns from 2012. The results suggest that measuring economic efficiency requires weighting surplus accruing to the poor roughly 1.5–2 times more than surplus accruing to the rich. This is because $1 of surplus to the poor can be turned into roughly $1.5–$2 of surplus to the rich by reducing the progressivity of the tax schedule. Following Kaldor and Hicks' original applications, I compare income distributions over time in the US and across countries. The results suggest US economic growth is 15–20% lower due to increased inequality than is suggested by changes in GDP. Because of its higher inequality, the U.S. is unable to replicate the income distribution of countries like Austria and the Netherlands, despite having higher national income per capita.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300621
Journal of Public Economics,2020,The equilibrium impact of unemployment insurance on unemployment: Evidence from a non-linear policy rule,Peter Fredriksson and Martin Söderström,"We estimate the “macro effect” of an increase in the generosity of unemployment insurance (UI) on unemployment in Sweden using regional data. The national UI benefit formula features a benefit ceiling and a statutory replacement rate, and does not take regional wage differentials into account. Changes in the national rules are useful for identification, since a change in the benefit ceiling, for example, has a greater impact on UI generosity in a high-wage region than in a low-wage region because a greater fraction of the workforce will be affected by the benefit ceiling in the high-wage region. We implement this identification strategy using data for the Swedish municipalities over the time period 1992–2014. Our estimates suggest that the macro elasticity of an increase in UI on unemployment is around 3. This is twice as large as the corresponding “micro elasticity”, which we estimate to 1.4–1.5 using data from the same time period.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300633

The assignment of students to different types of education at age 11 was instead replaced by ability grouping, whereby students followed a common general education curriculum but were divided into different classrooms based on their academic achievement. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that the reform raised individuals' level of education and increased their wages by 6% at ages 40 to 45. These effects are concentrated among men and individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

Journal of Public Economics,2020,A theory of informational autocracy,Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman,"We develop an informational theory of autocracy. Dictators survive not by means of force or ideology but because they convince the public—rightly or wrongly—that they are competent. Citizens do not observe the leader's type but infer it from signals in their living standards, state propaganda, and messages sent by an informed elite via independent media. If citizens conclude that the leader is incompetent, they overthrow him. The dictator can invest in making convincing state propaganda, censoring independent media, co-opting the elite, or equipping police to repress attempted uprisings—but he must finance such spending at the expense of the public's consumption. We show that informational autocracies prevail over old-style, overtly violent dictatorships when the informed elite is sufficiently large but are replaced by democracies when elites are too numerous to be bribed or censored. The theory provides insight into various soft authoritarian regimes around the world and suggests a logic of modernization behind recent global political trends.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300220

A decentralized allocation may offer informational advantages, but may be prone to elite capture. We study this trade-off in the context of two large-scale subsidy programs in Malawi (for agricultural inputs and food) decentralized to traditional leaders (“chiefs”) who are asked to target the needy. Using household panel data, we find that nepotism exists but has only limited mistargeting consequences. Importantly, we find that chiefs target households with higher returns to farm inputs, generating an allocation that is more productively efficient than what could be achieved through strict poverty-targeting. This could be welfare improving, since within-village redistribution is common.

I build a new county-level panel dataset of local newspaper presence, newspapers' number of journalists, costs and revenues and political turnout in France, from 1944 to 2014. I estimate the effect of newspaper entry by comparing counties that experience entry to similar counties in the same years that do not. Both sets of counties exhibit similar trends prior to entry, but those with entry experience substantial declines in the average number of journalists. An increased number of newspapers is also associated with fewer articles and less hard news provision. Newspaper entry, and the associated decline in information provision, is ultimately found to decrease voter turnout at local elections. Exploiting the long time span covered by my data, I discuss a number of mechanisms that may drive these empirical findings. First, I examine the relationship between increased competition and media capture in the aftermath of WW2, when newspapers were biased and the advertising market was underdeveloped. I then show that in the recent period the effects are stronger in counties with more homogeneous populations, as predicted by a vertical product differentiation framework, whereas there is little impact in counties with more heterogeneous populations.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301380

Then, I use the quasi-experimental setting of the introduction of a tax on vacancy in France in 1999 to identify the causal direct effect of the tax on the vacancy rate. Exploiting an exhaustive administrative dataset, which contains information on every housing unit in France from 1995 to 2013, I implement a difference-in-difference approach combined with a propensity score matching strategy.

We extend models of commodity tax competition to include multiple types of commodities, trade, and remote commerce, assuming, in accordance with current policy, that e-commerce is taxed at destination while cross-border shopping is taxed at origin. When the cost of online shopping falls, we show that equilibrium tax rates and revenues decrease in large, core jurisdictions but increase in small, peripheral ones, reducing tax differentials. Policy commentators warn that e-commerce erodes tax revenue – true enough for some governments – but, more accurately, changing transaction costs can generate entirely new commercial and fiscal equilibria that ultimately “redistribute” tax revenues from jurisdictions with concentrations of traditional vendors toward others. With some reinterpretation, the model is also adapted to analyze profit-tax competition when firms can respond to high taxes both through profit-shifting and through relocation, each dependent on transactions costs.

Utilizing data from the G7 and 130 developing countries between 1975 and 2012 and employing high dimensional fixed effects models, we show that incoming leaders in recipient countries, which politically converge towards their current donors, receive more aid commitments, compared to those that diverge. Accounting for donor leader change, we additionally find that incumbent recipient leaders have an opportunity to get even more aid when political change in donor countries moves them closer to the donor's foreign policy position. Thus, leadership turnover in recipient and donor countries makes otherwise inconsequential deviations in foreign policy alignment highly consequential for aid provision.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301690

These preferences exist independently of other components of decision rights, cannot be explained by social preferences and are not driven by mistakes, confusion or signaling intentions. We further show that valuation of power (i) is higher when individuals directly determine outcomes of others; (ii) depends on how much discretion one has over those outcomes; and (iii) is tied to relationships between individuals.

I find evidence that MMC reduces hospital costs at birth, which is driven by infants born in New York City. The hospital cost reductions arise from shortening the lengths of stay and encouraging inter-hospital transfers. These results are consistent with health plans influencing hospitals to reduce the intensity of treatment and steering patients away from high-cost hospitals.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301926
Journal of Public Economics,2020,The impact of industry consolidation on government procurement: Evidence from Department of Defense contracting,Rodrigo Carril and Mark Duggan,"We study the relationship between market structure and public procurement outcomes. In particular, we ask whether and to what extent consolidation-driven increases in industry concentration affect the way in which the government procures its goods and services. We focus on the defense industry, by far the largest contributor to federal procurement spending in the U.S. This industry experienced a sharp increase in the level of concentration during the 1990s, driven by a series of large mergers between defense contractors. Using detailed microdata on Department of Defense (DoD) contract awards, we estimate the causal effect of industry concentration on a series of procurement outcomes, leveraging the differential impact of these mergers across product markets. We find that market concentration caused the procurement process to become less competitive, with an increase in the share of spending awarded without competition, or via single-bid solicitations. Increased concentration also induced a shift from the use of fixed-price contracts towards cost-plus contracts. However, we find no evidence that consolidation led to a significant increase in acquisition costs. We infer that the government’s buyer power, especially relevant in this context given the government is often the only purchaser, constrained firms from exercising any additional market power gained by consolidation.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300050
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Friends with benefits: Patronage networks and distributive politics in China,Junyan Jiang and Muyang Zhang,"Existing research on distributive politics mainly focuses on the influence of electoral competition between political parties, but less is known about non-electoral mechanisms of resource allocation inside a dominant party. This study examines how informal patron–client networks within the ruling Communist Party shape the distribution of intergovernmental transfers in China, a major one-party regime. Using a new dataset on city-level fiscal transfers and a novel method to infer informal political connections through past promotions, we show that provincial leaders allocate significantly more transfers to localities governed by officials who are part of their networks. This bias persists even when we use a specification that only exploits variations in connection caused by exogenous turnovers of higher level leadership. We evaluate two plausible motivations behind this bias—network-based policy coordination and collective corruption—and find evidence in stronger support of the former. Our findings suggest that private networks may function as an important, albeit costly, tool of mobilization in one-party systems.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300074

It is characterized by an increase in the share of wealth which is individualized by spouses (vs. jointly owned) and by an increase in the share of wealth held by singles. We show that the usual measures of wealth inequality, which allocate the same share of household wealth to each spouse or partner, overestimate the share of wealth held by women. This results in an underestimation of both the level and the growth of a) wealth inequality between individuals and b) the gender wealth gap.

In industrialized countries, these debates grow in intensity with the aging of the population; however, an increase in the retirement age may create unintended side effects with regard to retirees' health or healthcare costs. This study empirically analyzes the effect of (early) retirement on individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare utilization in Austria. We use comprehensive labor market and retirement data from the Austrian Social Security Database, together with detailed information about individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare service utilization in the province of Upper Austria. To account for endogeneity in retirement decisions, we exploit exogenous variation in the early retirement age as induced by two Austrian pension reforms (i.e., those in 2000 and 2003). We find a significant negative effect of retirement on service utilization. For both genders, retirement reduces subsequent doctor visits and expenditure for outpatient medical attendance and hospitalization. Based on the analysis of disaggregated components of services and expenditure, we interpret the results as evidence for positive health effects and behavioral changes in the utilization of healthcare services after retirement.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300104

Using South African transaction-level customs data, I directly test for transfer price deviations from arm's-length pricing. I find that multinational firms in South Africa manipulate transfer prices in order to shift taxable profits to low-tax countries. The estimated tax loss relating to imported goods alone is 0.5% of corporate tax payments. My estimates do not support the common belief that transfer mispricing in South Africa is more severe than in advanced economies.

Journal of Public Economics,2020,Do peers influence occupational preferences? Evidence from randomly-assigned peer groups at West Point,Todd Jones and Michael Kofoed,"There is substantial variation across occupations in outcomes, such as earnings, job satisfaction, and health, yet little is known about how occupational preferences are shaped and evolve. This paper assesses a channel that may influence occupational preferences—peer effects—by exploiting unique institutional features and a natural experiment at West Point to document the way students' (i.e., cadets') occupational preferences evolve, and to test for peer effects. After graduation, cadets must enter the U.S. Army as an officer in one of 16 occupational branches, and are required to rank-order their preferences for the branches repeatedly over four years. West Point randomly assigns cadets to social groups, both at broad company and narrow roommate levels. We leverage the timing of the randomization and preference elicitations to test for peer effects at the company, roommate, and older-peer levels. With the possible exception of the first few weeks of exposure, we find little evidence of peer effects. We also use a survey of cadets to explore mechanisms and find evidence that peer information may not be credible in this case, but rather cadets rely on mentors and job characteristics when making this decision.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300189
Journal of Public Economics,2020,"Should congested cities reduce their speed limits? Evidence from São Paulo, Brazil","Amanda Ang, Peter Christensen and Renato Vieira","Road accidents are the leading cause of unnatural deaths worldwide. Cities are experimenting with more stringent speed limits in an effort to reduce them. The impacts of these policies are unclear in many developing country cities, where a disproportionate share of accident damages occur but also where speed regulations could exacerbate already high levels of congestion. We evaluate a speed limit reduction program in São Paulo, Brazil using a dynamic event study design and measurements of 125 thousand traffic accidents, 38 million traffic tickets issued by monitoring cameras, and 1.4 million repeat observations of real-time trip durations before and after a regulatory change. We find that the program resulted in 1889 averted accidents within the first 18 months and reduced accidents by 21.7% on treated roads, with larger effects on roads with camera-based enforcement. The program also affected travel times on treated roads (5.5%), though the social benefits from reduced accidents are at least 1.32 times larger than the social costs of longer trip times. The benefits of accident reductions accrue largely to lower income pedestrians and motorcyclists, indicating that speed limit reductions may have important impacts on low income residents in developing country cities.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300190

We utilize a heterogeneous firm model in which monopolistically competitive North firms choose whether to outsource an intermediate good to an unrelated South firm or to produce in a subsidiary in the South. Standard pass through arguments no longer apply because of the income shifting behavior of multinationals and endogenous choice of organizational form. The high tax North country will prefer a destination-based tax over a source-based tax if it adopts a cash flow tax, but whether the cash flow tax is preferred to an income tax will depend on the volume of trade in the differentiated products sector. If the high tax country adopts a destination-based cash flow tax, the low tax country will prefer a destination-based income tax to capture rents from the foreign subsidiaries.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300244

Second, the observed response cannot be fully attributed to labor supply alone; rather, the observed outcomes are highly dependent on the availability of jobs and, so are strongly influenced by labor demand incentives.

Overcoming endogeneity concerns by analyzing the local implications of the largest national scandal in recent Italian history (“Clean Hands”), our main results show that local politicians withdraw support from incumbents in parties hit by Clean Hands – inducing early government dissolutions in such municipalities. Consistent with these municipality-level findings, we then illustrate that local politicians from the implicated parties exhibit lower re-running rates and higher rates of party switching in the short term. In the medium term, we find that corruption and voter turnout are lower in competitive municipalities ‘treated’ with a mayor from the implicated parties during Clean Hands. Moreover, medium-term upward career mobility of local politicians from the implicated parties benefited from party switching.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300360

Despite the advantages IDR would offer to many borrowers, take-up remains low. We use a survey experiment investigate how framing affects University of Maryland undergraduates' take-up of IDR in a set of hypothetical scenarios. Students are significantly more likely to choose IDR when the insurance aspects of IDR are emphasized and significantly less likely to do so when costs are emphasized. IDR framing interacts with expected labor market outcomes. Emphasizing the insurance aspects of IDR has larger effects on students who anticipate a higher probability of nonemployment and/or low earnings at graduation. In contrast, when costs are emphasized, the choice of IRDR is uncorrelated with students' expected labor market outcomes. Simulation results suggest that a simple change in the framing of IDR could generate substantial reductions in loan defaults with only small decreases in long-run federal revenue.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301288

We exploit variation from a large reform in 2010 to estimate intensive- and extensive-margin tax-price elasticities of giving. Using a predicted-tax-rate instrument for the price of giving relative to consumption, we find an intensive-margin elasticity of about − 0.2 and an extensive-margin elasticity of − 0.1, yielding a total elasticity of about − 0.3. To further explore the extensive-margin response, we propose a model with a fixed cost of declaring donations and obtain a structural estimate of that cost of around £47. We also study the welfare effects of tax incentives, extending the theoretical literature to allow for extensive-margin giving and for a fixed cost of declaring donations. Taking into account these factors, there is a case for increasing the subsidy on charitable giving in the UK.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301768

Journal of Public Economics,2020,Taxation and the allocation of risk inside the multinational firm,"Johannes Becker, Niels Johannesen and Nadine Riedel","This paper provides the first theoretical and empirical analysis of how taxation shapes the joint allocation of risk and profits inside the multinational firm. Theoretically, we identify three mechanisms through which corporate taxes may shape the within-firm allocation of risk: (1) transfer pricing rules requiring risk to be compensated with higher expected returns create incentives to shift risk to low-tax jurisdictions as a means to shift profits; (2) risk-averse owners create incentives to allocate risk to high-tax affiliates to maximize risk-sharing with governments; (3) limited loss offset creates incentives to shift risk to affiliates in other countries. Empirically, we show that multinational firms disproportionately allocate risk to low-tax countries and that the key mechanism is the nexus between risk and profits established by transfer pricing rules. Within-firm differences in risk explain a significant fraction of the well-established correlation between profits and tax rates suggesting that risk shifting is a quantitatively non-negligible channel for profit shifting.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300025

End-loading of review completions alone, however, is not dispositive evidence of procrastination. In this paper, we confirm that examiners complete a substantial percentage of reviews at the end of both bi-weekly and quarterly quotas and then proceed to test for additional markers that may separate a procrastination explanation for these findings from a range of alternative theories. Among other tests explored in this regard, we predict and find evidence of an immediate spike in end-loading upon the onset of examiner telecommuting, a change in work environments that likely exacerbates self-control problems. Our findings support a procrastination interpretation for at least some portion of the observed end-loading of reviews, with our outcomes analysis suggesting that the predominant consequence of this behavior for examination quality is an increase in examination durations.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300049

Districts with passing levies directed new revenue toward support services and instructor salaries but did not increase teacher staffing levels. These districts eventually realized gains in student achievement and attainment. Our preferred estimates imply that increasing operational spending by $1000 per pupil increased test scores by approximately 0.15 of a standard deviation and graduation rates by approximately 9 percentage points.

Journal of Public Economics,2020,Which early withdrawal penalty attracts the most deposits to a commitment savings account?,"John Beshears, James Choi, Christopher Harris, David Laibson, Brigitte Madrian and Jung Sakong","Previous research has shown that some people voluntarily use commitment contracts that restrict their own choice sets. We study how people divide money between two accounts: a liquid account that permits unrestricted withdrawals and a commitment account that is randomly assigned in a between-subject design to have either a 10% early withdrawal penalty, or a 20% early withdrawal penalty, or not to allow early withdrawals at all (i.e., an infinite penalty). When the liquid account and the commitment account pay the same interest rate, higher early-withdrawal penalties attract more commitment account deposits. This pattern is predicted by the hypothesis that some participants are partially- or fully-sophisticated present-biased agents. Such agents perceive that higher penalties generate greater scope for commitment by disincentivizing (penalized) early withdrawals. The experiment also shows that when the commitment account pays a higher interest rate than the liquid account, the positive empirical slope relating penalties and commitment deposits is flattened, suggesting that naïve present-biased agents or agents with standard exponential discounting are also in our sample. Across all of our experimental treatments, higher early withdrawal penalties on the commitment account sometimes increase and never reduce allocations to the commitment account.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720300086

Inequality-averse, altruistic and maximin subjects, all characterized by benevolence in the domain of advantageous inequality, sit at the opposite end of the spectrum. Overall, our evidence indicates that political outcomes in various domains such as taxation, social security, the pension system or immigration cannot be fully understood without taking distributional preferences into account.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301379

We study a simple economy, involving a benevolent policy-maker and a population of agents differing in terms of productivities, labor supply elasticities, and shifting costs. Paying special attention to the cost structure of income shifting, we highlight that when people who shift easily along the extensive margin are also more elastic in labor supply, giving them a lower tax rate is a good thing, and the government should not necessarily combat income shifting. This mechanism may be compared to third-degree price discrimination in industrial organization and works as a form of endogenous tagging.

Journal of Public Economics,2020,Disincentive effects of unemployment benefits and the role of caseworkers,Johannes Schmieder and Simon Trenkle,"A large literature has documented that the unemployment duration of unemployment insurance (UI) recipients increases with the generosity of the UI system. This has been interpreted as the disincentive effect of UI benefits; however, unemployed workers typically also have caseworkers assigned who are monitoring and assisting the job search efforts. These caseworkers may respond to differences in UI eligibility by shifting resources (financial or time) between unemployed individuals in order to counteract the moral hazard effect of UI benefits or in order to focus resources to where they have the largest effect. This suggests that the typical estimates of the disincentive effects of UI may be biased in studies that compare workers within the same UI agency. We estimate whether caseworkers respond to the generosity of UI using a regression discontinuity (RD) design in Germany, where potential UI durations vary with age. We show that across a wide variety of measures, such as meetings, sanctions, and training programs UI caseworkers do not treat unemployed with different eligibility differently. At best we find a very small effect that workers with shorter eligibility close to the exhaustion point are more likely to be assigned to training programs that prolong their UI eligibility. The typical RD estimates of the UI disincentive effects thus seem to be valid estimates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301574

To do this, I evaluate pension reforms in Soviet Russia in 1964 and 1969 that allowed pensioners to receive a greater share of their pensions if they worked, resulting in a progressive elimination of benefit reduction rates. Variation in group eligibility and variation in benefit reduction rates in eastern and western regions allow for the use of several difference-in-differences frameworks. I collect and digitize novel data from the Soviet archives on pensioner employment, constructing the first database of the Soviet old-age labor market. I find that Soviet pensioners are responsive to financial incentives. By 1969, after the benefit reduction rate fell from an average of 47.8% to 24.1%, pensioner employment rates rose by 5.7 percentage points, representing a 47% increase.

We compare the employment reactions of the winner of an auction with the employment reactions of the second ranked firm (i.e., the runner-up firm). Assuming similar ex-ante winning probabilities for both firms, we view winning an auction as an exogenous shock to a firm's production and its demand for labor. Detailed daily employment data cover almost 600 construction firms and over 2500 auctions in Austria over the time period 2006 to 2009. Our main results show that the winning firm significantly increases labor demand in the weeks following an auction but only in the years before the recent economic crisis. It employs about 80 workers (around 3% of the workforce) more after the auction than the runner-up firm. Most of the adjustment takes place within one month after the demand shock. Winners predominantly fire fewer workers after winning than runner-up firms. In the crisis, however, firms do not employ more workers than their competitors after winning an auction. There are no effects on wages. We view labor hoarding and productivity improvements induced by the crisis as the most likely explanations for our findings. We also discuss implications for fiscal and stimulus policy in the crisis.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301744

Event study estimates suggest that parliament adoption increases total spending by about 6% and that this increase is driven mostly by general administration and education spending. To understand potential mechanisms at play, we run a survey among assembly participants and document a sizeable under-representation of 20- to 40-year-olds, as well as of women in assemblies compared to both voters in elections and to the electorate at large. Since these two demographics have relatively strong preferences for public spending on education in our setting, switching from citizen assembly to parliament likely increased their representation in the political process.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301847

Evidence from New York,Daniel Tannenbaum,"While the social costs of gun violence are high, opponents of gun restrictions argue that gun ownership deters crime and creates a positive externality by increasing unobserved risk to criminals. This paper investigates the evidence for these two deterrence channels, exploiting the sudden disclosure of all handgun permit holders' names and addresses in two New York counties. Permit holders have more crime incidents at their homes relative to non-permit holders in the baseline, which is not driven by selection into neighborhoods. I find little evidence in favor of direct deterrence, and little evidence of peer deterrence. Instead, I find that victimization is associated with a higher likelihood of future gun ownership.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301367
Journal of Public Economics,2020,The impact of mass shootings on gun policy,"Michael Luca, Deepak Malhotra and Christopher Poliquin","There have been dozens of high-profile mass shootings in recent decades. This paper presents three main findings about the impact of mass shootings on gun policy. First, mass shootings evoke large policy responses. A single mass shooting leads to a 15% increase in the number of firearm bills introduced within a state in the year after a mass shooting. This effect increases with the extent of media coverage. Second, mass shootings account for a small portion of all gun deaths, but have an outsized influence relative to other homicides. Third, when looking at bills that were actually enacted into law, the impact of mass shootings depends on the party in power. The annual number of laws that loosen gun restrictions doubles in the year following a mass shooting in states with Republican-controlled legislatures. We find no significant effect of mass shootings on laws enacted when there is a Democrat-controlled legislature, nor do we find a significant effect of mass shootings on the enactment of laws that tighten gun restrictions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301446
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Missing miles: Evasion responses to car taxes,"Jarkko Harju, Tuomas Kosonen and Joel Slemrod","We study a tax evasion response to car taxes in Finland, where used car importers overstate the mileage to reduce tax liability. First, we develop a tax evasion measure by comparing reported mileage upon import with subsequent information from vehicle inspections, and find that a decline in mileage — “missing miles” — occurs frequently. Second, we analyze a tax rate increase, and observe a reduction in the number of imported used cars, but only among non-evaders. Finally, we analyze an RCT informing some potential importers about a program of inspections that uncovers true odometer readings, and the results suggest that third-party reporting reduces evasion.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272719301707
Journal of Public Economics,2020,Women in top incomes – Evidence from Sweden 1971–2017,"Anne Boschini, Kristin Gunnarsson and Jesper Roine","Using yearly register data on the full population of Sweden we study gender differences in top incomes, down to the top 0.01 percentile group, over the period 1971–2017. We find that, while women are still a minority of the top decile, and typically make up a smaller share the higher up in the distribution we move, their presence has steadily increased in all top groups over the past half-century. At the beginning of the period, top income women relied more on capital incomes, but the rise in the share of top women is not due to the growing importance of capital. Instead, women have increased their presence in the top by gains in the top of labour incomes, while top income men have captured most of the growth in capital incomes. Studying gender differences in observable characteristics we find small gender differences in some respects, convergence in others, but also some important remaining differences. Overall, our results suggest that many findings in the top income literature have a clear gender component and that understanding gender equality in the top of the distribution requires studying not only earnings and labour market outcomes but also incomes from other sources, as well as family circumstances.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727271930177X
