AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Information Frictions and Skill Signaling in the Youth Labor Market,Sara B. Heller and Judd B. Kessler,"This paper provides evidence that information frictions limit the labor market trajectories of US youth. We provide credible skill signals—recommendation letters based on supervisor feedback—to a random subset of 43,409 participants in New York's summer jobs program. Letters increase employment the following year by 3 percentage points (4.5 percent). Earnings effects grow over four years to a cumulative $1,349 (4.9 percent). We find little evidence of increased job search or confidence; instead, signals may help employers better identify successful matches with high-productivity workers. Pulling youth into the labor market can, however, hamper on-time graduation, especially among low-achieving students.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220544
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,High Schools Tailored to Adults Can Help Them Complete a Traditional Diploma and Excel in the Labor Market,"Rebecca Brough, David Phillips and Patrick S. Turner","Over 18 million adults in the United States lack a high school credential. While some go on to attain the GED, diplomas are potentially more valuable. A network of high schools helps adults graduate by providing tailored curricula, nonacademic coaching, onsite child care, and transportation. After five years, earnings increase by 38 percent more for graduates than nonenrolling applicants. We address selection by conditioning on preapplication earnings and comparing to students who exit after positive shocks. Much of the wage gains can be accounted for by sectoral switching and evidence on credential completions is consistent with a human capital mechanism.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230053
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Pricing Carbon: Evidence from Expert Recommendations,"Moritz Drupp, Frikk Nesje and Robert C. Schmidt","We study the variation of carbon price recommendations and their determinants using survey evidence from more than 400 experts across almost 40 countries. We quantify the extent of disagreement and reveal that a majority of experts can agree on short- and medium-term global carbon price levels, and on unilateral carbon price levels in most countries. The majority of recommendations do not exhibit a ""free riding"" pattern of lower unilateral than global carbon prices. Furthermore, border carbon adjustment facilitates higher unilateral price recommendations. We show how recommendations vary with additional survey responses, and with country and expert characteristics.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220571
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Real-Time Pricing and the Cost of Clean Power,"Imelda Imelda, Matthias Fripp and Michael Roberts","Solar and wind power are now cheaper than fossil fuels but are intermittent. The extra supply-side variability implies growing benefits of using real-time retail pricing (RTP). We evaluate the potential gains of RTP using a model that jointly solves investment, supply, storage, and demand to obtain a chronologically detailed dynamic equilibrium for the island of Oahu, Hawai'i. We find that, holding demand assumptions fixed, RTP reduces costs in high-renewable systems by roughly 6 to 12 times as much as in fossil systems, markedly lowering the cost of clean energy integration.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220506
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Identity in Court Decision-Making,"Ulrika Ahrsjö, Susan Niknami and Mårten Palme","We explore the role of identity along multiple dimensions in high-stakes decision-making. Our data contain information about demographic and socioeconomic indicators for defendants and randomly assigned jurors in a Swedish court. Our results show that defendants are 4 to 6 percent less likely to get a prison sentence if judged by one more juror belonging to the same identity-forming group. Moreover, they are given 10 percent shorter prison sentences. Socioeconomic background and demographic attributes are equally important for identity effects, and these effects stem from trials of longer duration and where the defendant is present in the courtroom.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220802
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,The School-to-Prison Pipeline: Long-Run Impacts of School Suspensions on Adult Crime,"Andrew Bacher-Hicks, Stephen B. Billings and David Deming","Schools must balance student behavior management with the potential negatives of strict discipline. These policies can deter misbehavior but may stigmatize students and expose them to the criminal justice system early. We assess the impact of attending a strict discipline school on achievement, educational attainment, and adult criminal activity. Using data from a boundary change and principal switches, we find that higher suspension rates have significant negative long-term effects. Students at such schools are 15–20 percent more likely to be arrested and incarcerated as adults. Negative impacts on educational attainment are particularly pronounced for males and students of color.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230052
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Downward Revision of Investment Decisions after Corporate Tax Hikes,"Sebastian Link, Manuel Menkhoff, Andreas Peichl and Paul Schüle","This paper estimates the causal effect of corporate tax hikes on firm investment based on more than 1,400 local tax changes. By observing planned and realized investment volumes in a representative sample of German manufacturing firms, we can study how tax hikes induce firms to revise their investment decisions. On average, the share of firms that invest less than previously planned increases by 3 percentage points after a tax hike. This effect is twice as large during recessions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220530
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Managers' Productivity and Recruitment in the Public Sector,Pablo Muñoz and Mounu Prem,"Governments face many constraints in attracting talented managers to the public sector, which often lacks high-powered incentives. In this paper, we study how a civil service reform in Chile changed the effectiveness of a vital group of public sector managers: school principals. First, we estimate principal effectiveness by using an extension of the canonical teacher value-added model. Then we evaluate the effect of the reform on principal effectiveness using a difference-in-differences approach. We find that public schools appointed more effective managers and improved their students' outcomes after increasing the competitiveness and transparency of their selection process.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220732
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,How Do You Say Your Name? Difficult-to-Pronounce Names and Labor Market Outcomes,Qi Ge and Stephen Wu,"We test for labor market discrimination based on an understudied characteristic: name fluency. Analysis of recent economics PhD job candidates indicates that name difficulty is negatively related to the probability of landing an academic or tenure-track position and research productivity of initial institutional placement. Discrimination due to name fluency is also found using experimental data from prior audit studies. Within samples of African Americans (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004) and ethnic immigrants (Oreopoulos 2011), job applicants with less fluent names experience lower callback rates, and name complexity explains roughly between 10 and 50 percent of ethnic name penalties. The results are primarily driven by candidates with weaker résumés, suggesting that cognitive biases may contribute to the penalty of having a difficult-to-pronounce name.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220611
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Achieving Air Pollution Control Targets with Technology-Aided Monitoring: Better Enforcement or Localized Efforts?,"Lin Yang, Yatang Lin, Jin Wang and Fangyuan Peng","Weak enforcement of environmental regulations remains a global issue due to inadequate monitoring and misaligned incentives. This paper examines the effects of automated monitoring on achieving air pollution control targets amidst China's war on pollution. Utilizing the staggered rollout process and remote-sensing data, we find local governments respond to the advanced monitoring system by strategically targeting areas near monitors, resulting in a 3.2 percent decrease in pollution adjacent to automated monitors compared to areas farther away. Furthermore, we observe heterogeneity in response across cities with varying degrees of preexisting data manipulation and among officials facing different incentives and public pressure.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220810
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Administrative Burden and Procedural Denials: Experimental Evidence from SNAP,"Eric Giannella, Tatiana Homonoff, Gwen Rino and Jason Somerville","Many government program applications result in procedural denials due to administrative burdens associated with applying. We identify the intake interview as a key barrier to take-up of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and study the effect of an alternative application process designed to reduce burdens. Using a field experiment involving 65,000 Los Angeles applicants, we find that access to flexible interviews initiated by the applicant increases approvals by 6 percentage points, doubles early approvals, and increases long-term participation by over 2 percentage points. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating flexibility when designing program integrity policies to minimize procedural denials.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220701
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Education and Geographical Mobility: The Role of the Job Surplus,Michael Amior,"Better educated workers accept many more long-distance job offers, and relocate quicker following local shocks. I attribute this to a fundamental feature of their labor market experience, unrelated to geography: large returns to job match quality. If a good offer happens to originate from far away, the match surplus is then more likely to justify the cost of moving. This ""lubricates"" labor markets spatially. Using wage transition data (and a jobs ladder model), I show this can explain the bulk of mobility differentials. These differentials can be closed by subsidizing long-distance matches, and I quantify the cost of doing so.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230279
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Algorithmic Risk Assessment in the Hands of Humans,Megan T. Stevenson and Jennifer L. Doleac,"We evaluate the impacts of adopting algorithmic risk assessments in sentencing. We find that judges changed sentencing practices in response to the risk assessment, but that discretion played a large role in mediating its impact. Judges deviated from the recommendations associated with the algorithm in systematic ways, suggestive of alternative objectives. As a result, risk assessment did not lead to detectable gains in terms of public safety or reduced incarceration rates. Using simulations, we show that strict adherence to the sentencing recommendations associated with the algorithm would have had benefits (less incarceration) but also some costs (increased sentences for youth).",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220620
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,The Carrot and the Stick: Bank Bailouts and the Disciplining Role of Board Appointments,"Christian Mücke, Loriana Pelizzon, Vincenzo Pezone and Anjan Thakor",We empirically examine the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) used by the US government to bail out distressed banks and its implications for regulatory policy. We find strong evidence that a feature of the CPP—the government's ability to appoint independent directors on the board of an assisted bank that missed six dividend payments to the Treasury—had a significant effect on bank behavior. Banks were averse to these appointments—the empirical distribution of missed payments exhibits a sharp discontinuity at five. Director appointments by the Treasury were associated with improved bank performance and lower CEO pay.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230313
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Price Sensitivity and Information Barriers to the Take-up of Naloxone,Mireille Jacobson and David Powell,"We conducted a field experiment that randomized advertisements, advertisement content, and prices across 2,204 counties in the United States to study the impacts on online purchases of naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug. Advertising increased website users but only impacted purchases when combined with a price reduction. Messages emphasizing the discreet nature of online sales had no additional impact on purchases. Comparing counties with advertisements featuring a highly discounted price to those featuring the full price, we estimate a price elasticity of demand for online naloxone of −1.3. Price is a significant barrier to online purchases of this lifesaving medication.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230135
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Remote Instruction and Student Mental Health: Swedish Evidence from the Pandemic,"Evelina Björkegren, Helena Svaleryd and Jonas Vlachos","When COVID-19 reached Sweden, upper-secondary students (ages 17–19) transitioned to remote instruction, while lower-secondary schools (ages 14–16) remained open. We use this setting as a natural experiment to analyze how modes of instruction affect student mental health. We find a 4.4 percent decrease in mental health care use from remote instruction, primarily due to fewer diagnoses and prescriptions for depression and anxiety. The reduction persists throughout the study period; 21 months after the initial closure and 9 months after schools resumed usual operations. This suggests potential mental health benefits from remote instruction, at least in the medium term.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220699
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Labor Market Effects of Credit Constraints: Evidence from a Natural Experiment,Anil Kumar and Che-Yuan Liang,"We exploit the 1997 and 2003 constitutional amendments in Texas—allowing home equity loans and lines of credit for nonhousing purposes—as natural experiments to estimate the effect of easier credit access on the labor market. Using state-level as well as micro data, we find that easier access to housing credit led to a notably lower labor force participation rate between 1997 and 2007. Our findings are remarkably robust to improved synthetic control methods based on insights from machine learning. Our research shows that negative labor market effects of easier credit access are important for assessing its stimulative impact on overall growth.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200683
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Learning by Offending: How Do Criminals Learn about Criminal Law?,Arnaud Philippe,"This paper investigates how criminals learn about criminal laws. It uses a natural experiment in which sentences were drastically increased for a specific type of recidivism in France. In the short run, advertising the reform did not trigger any change in criminal behavior. However, people who had firsthand experience of the reform learned about it and later committed significantly fewer targeted crimes, but the same number of nontargeted crimes. Learning appears to be limited to individuals with direct experience of the law. While codefendants also learned, other criminal peers and defendants attending the same trial for another case did not.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210378
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Gender Differences in Preferences for Meaning at Work,"Vanessa Burbano, Nicolas Padilla and Stephan Meier","Scholars have examined whether preferences for job characteristics help explain why men and women sort into different occupations but have overlooked preferences for meaning at work. We first document gender differences in preferences for meaning in a large-scale survey covering individuals in 47 countries. We then conduct a choice-based conjoint analysis of a cohort of MBA students at a leading business school to study gender differences in preferences for meaning compared to other job attributes. We show that gender differences in preferences for meaning at work are widespread and partly explain gender differences in behavioral outcomes, including industry of work.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220121
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Did the Paycheck Protection Program Help Small Businesses? Evidence from Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities,"Sumit Agarwal, Brent Ambrose, Luis A. Lopez and Xue Xiao","In this study, we examine the broader economic effects of the US federal government's Paycheck Protection Program by focusing on the performance of securitized commercial mortgages. We provide novel evidence for spillover effects of government interventions in the face of economic crises. We find that the PPP reduced mortgage delinquencies by approximately $36 billion in 2020. The strongest effects occur when PPP funds targeted businesses in areas most affected by COVID-19, where banks overperformed in providing PPP loans, and among mortgages on properties in retail and lodging. Thus, PPP relief to small businesses eased economic distress beyond the labor market.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220181
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Intergenerational and Sibling Spillovers in High School Majors,"Gordon Dahl, Dan-Olof Rooth and Anders Stenberg","This paper estimates family spillovers in high school major choice in Sweden, where admission to oversubscribed majors is determined based on GPA. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find large sibling and intergenerational spillovers that depend on the sex mix of a dyad. Same-sex siblings copy one another, while younger brothers recoil from an older sister's choices. Fathers and mothers influence sons but not their daughters, except when a mother majors in the male-dominated program of engineering. Back-of-the-envelope calculations reveal that these within-family spillovers have sizable implications for the sex composition of majors.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220197
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,The Impact of Legal Abortion on Maternal Mortality,"Sherajum Monira Farin, Lauren Hoehn-Velasco and Michael Pesko","Legal abortion has recently been suggested as an essential health care service. In this study, we consider whether abortion legalization over 1969–1973 improved women's health as measured by maternal mortality. Our event study results indicate that legal abortion substantially lowered non-White maternal mortality by 30–50 percent, with 134 non-White maternal deaths averted nationally in the first year abortion became legal. We also find that early state-level legalizations were crucial and more influential than the Roe v. Wade decision itself.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220208
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Firm Donations and Political Rhetoric: Evidence from a National Ban,"Julia Cagé, Caroline Le Pennec and Elisa Mougin","We study France's 1995 ban on firm donations to politicians. We use a difference-in-differences approach and a novel dataset combining the campaign manifestos issued by candidates running in French parliamentary elections with data on their campaign contributions. We show that banning firm donations discourages candidates from advertising their local presence during the campaign, as well as economic issues. The ban also leads candidates from nonmainstream parties to use more extreme language. This suggests that private donors shape politicians' topics of interest, and that campaign finance reforms may affect the information made available to voters through their impact on candidates' rhetoric.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220218
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,The Effects of a Large-Scale Mental Health Reform: Evidence from Brazil,Mateus Dias and Luiz Felipe Fontes,"This paper studies the Brazilian Psychiatric Reform, which reorganized the public mental health care provision by introducing mental health centers (CAPS) as a community-based substitute for inpatient care. Our research design exploits the rollout of CAPS in a difference-in-differences framework. We show that these centers increased outpatient mental health care production and reduced psychiatric hospitalizations. These reductions were more pronounced for long-stay admissions and among patients with schizophrenia. We find that the savings implied by fewer admissions do not offset the cost of the policy. Also, the reform did not reduce mental health mortality and it increased violent crimes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220246
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Tripping through Hoops: The Effect of Violating Compulsory Government Procedures,Natalia Emanuel and Helen Ho,"Millions of Americans must navigate complex government procedures under the threat of punishment. Violating these requirements can lead to poverty traps or deepening legal system involvement. We use a field experiment to estimate the effect of failing to appear for court on subsequent legal contact. The treatments reduce failure to appear by 40 percent. Using treatment assignment to identify the causal impact of minor procedural violations, we find no effect on arrests. However, for lower-level cases, violations increase fines and fees paid by 59 percent or $79, equivalent to a high-interest loan, showing that minor procedural violations can be costly.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220331
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,How Do Copayment Coupons Affect Branded Drug Prices and Quantities Purchased?,"Leemore Dafny, Kate Ho and Edward Kong","We estimate the causal effects of drug copayment coupons, which reduce consumer cost sharing for branded prescription drugs, on net-of-rebate price and quantities sold. We show that coupon introductions increase the quantity of drugs without generic substitutes sold by 23–25 percent for the commercial segment relative to Medicare Advantage, where coupons are banned. To quantify the resulting equilibrium price effects, we estimate a discrete choice model of demand for multiple sclerosis drugs and simulate a model of drug price negotiations. We estimate that net-of-rebate prices are 8 percent higher due to coupons being offered for most of these drugs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220355
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Indirect Savings from Public Procurement Centralization,"Clarissa Lotti, Arieda Muco, Giancarlo Spagnolo and Tommaso Valletti","Centralization of public procurement can lower prices for the government's direct purchase of goods and services. This paper focuses on indirect savings. Public administrations that do not procure directly through a central procurement agency might benefit from the availability of centrally procured goods. We exploit the introduction of a central purchasing agency in Italy and find that prices came down by 22 percent among administrations that bought autonomously. These indirect effects appear to be driven by informational externalities, especially for less competent public buyers purchasing technologically more complex goods. Accounting for indirect savings increases the estimate of direct ones.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220357
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Shaping the Habits of Teen Drivers,Timothy Moore and Todd Morris,"We show that a targeted law can modify teens' risky behavior. We examine the effects of an Australian intervention banning first-year drivers from driving late at night with multiple peers, which had accounted for one-fifth of their traffic fatalities. Using data on individual drivers linked to crash outcomes, we find the reform more than halves targeted crashes, casualties and deaths. There are large positive spillovers through lower crashes earlier in the evening and beyond the first year, suggesting broad and persistent declines in high-risk driving. Overall, the targeted intervention delivers gains comparable to harsher restrictions that delay teen driving.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220403
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Optimal Internality Taxation of Product Attributes,Andreas Gerster and Michael Kramm,"This paper explores how a benevolent policymaker should optimally tax (or subsidize) product attributes when consumers are behaviorally biased. We demonstrate that market choices are informative about biases, which can be exploited for targeting biased consumers via a nonlinear tax schedule. We show that the properties of this schedule depend on few parameters of the joint distribution of consumer valuations and biases. Furthermore, we provide a novel justification for behaviorally motivated product standards and derive when a combination of taxes and standards is optimal. We illustrate our findings based on a numerical example from the lightbulb market.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220416

Using a regression discontinuity design, we show access to rural roads increases agricultural fires and particulate emissions. Farm labor exits are a likely mechanism: rural roads cause movement of workers out of agriculture and induce farmers to use fire—a labor-saving but polluting technology—to clear agricultural residue or to make harvesting less labor-intensive. Overall, the adoption of fires due to rural roads increases infant mortality rates by 5.5 percent in downwind locations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220422
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Government Transfers and Votes for State Intervention,"Giuseppe Albanese, Guido de Blasio and Lorenzo Incoronato","Government transfers might have long-lasting consequences on electoral outcomes. We study a regional policy implemented in Italy over the second half of the twentieth century and leverage variation in transfers to show that parties promoting more state intervention in the economy performed better in the targeted areas relative to places that were not subsidized, decades after the end of the policy. This effect does not seem to mirror long-term differences in the economic performance of treated and control areas, which were small, nor other attitudes within the electorate.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220452
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Competitive Bidding in Drug Procurement: Evidence from China,"Shengmao Cao, Lisa Xuejie Yi and Chuan Yu","We study the equilibrium effects of introducing competitive bidding in drug procurement. In 2019, China introduced a competitive bidding program where drug companies bid for a prespecified procurement quantity in nine provinces. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show the program reduced average drug prices by 47.4 percent. Generic drugs won most bids and cut prices by 75.0 percent. We develop an equilibrium model to quantify the trade-off between lower prices and potential choice distortions. Competitive bidding increases consumer welfare if policymakers believe consumers should value branded and bioequivalent generic drugs equally. The program also reduced government expenditure on insurance by 19.8 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220505

We study close elections between White and non-White candidates for California city council and the corresponding impact on housing values, a summary statistic for neighborhood investment. We find electing non-White rather than White candidates generates differential home value gains in majority non-White neighborhoods. This result, which is not explained by correlations between candidate race and political affiliation or neighborhood racial composition and income, suggests that increased representation can reduce racial disparities.

AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,The Returns to STEM Programs for Less-Prepared Students,Kevin Ng and Evan Riehl,"The returns to selective STEM programs depend on whether students complete these programs, earnings conditional on completion, and counterfactual schooling choices. Much research has focused on only one of these margins, potentially leading to an incomplete picture of the returns to STEM education for students with less academic preparation. Using data from a Colombian University and two empirical strategies, we find less-prepared students have higher earnings returns to selective STEM programs than more-prepared students, even though they are less likely to complete these programs. A key mechanism is that less-prepared students have lower-paying counterfactual schooling options.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200694

We use data describing the near universe of public libraries to show that public library capital investment increases library visits, children's attendance at library events, and children's circulation by an average of 5–15 percent in the years following investment. Increases in library use translate into improved test scores in nearby school districts: a $200 or greater per student capital investment in local public libraries increases reading test scores by 0.01–0.04 standard deviations in subsequent years.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210300

We contribute to this debate by investigating the joint impact of parental leave and childcare, using administrative data covering Austrian workers over more than half a century. We start by quasi-experimentally identifying the causal effects of all family policy reforms since the 1950s on the full dynamics of male and female earnings. We then map these causal estimates into a decomposition framework to compute counterfactual gender inequality series.

However, we do find persistent reductions in labor supply: long waits increase medium to long-term work absences and permanent disability receipt. Effects are driven by individuals who are on sick leave at referral.

Using administrative data on job applications made by the universe of Danish unemployment insurance recipients, we provide evidence on gender differences in applied-for jobs for the broader labor market.

For identification, we exploit air quality improvements caused by Low Emission Zones, a policy imposing driving restrictions on emission-intensive vehicles.

Combining French accounting, customs, and patent information at the firm level, we show that the output shock is detrimental to firms' sales, employment, and innovation. Moreover, this negative impact is concentrated in low-productivity firms. On the other hand, the impact of the input supply shock is reversed.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210753
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Time Aggregation in Health Insurance Deductibles,Long Hong and Corina Mommaerts,"Health insurance plans increasingly pay for expenses only beyond a large annual deductible. This paper explores the implications of deductibles that reset over shorter timespans. We develop a model of insurance demand between two actuarially equivalent deductible policies in which one deductible is larger and resets annually and the other deductible is smaller and resets biannually. Our model incorporates borrowing constraints, moral hazard, midyear contract switching, and delayable care. Calibrations using claims data show that the liquidity benefits of resetting deductibles can generate welfare gains of 3–10 percent of premium costs, particularly for individuals with borrowing constraints.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210799

These formulas unify existing canonical ones and feature a new term capturing the effect of variety on consumer surplus. As a proof of concept, we use theoretical formulas to identify love-of-variety preferences in an empirical application. Our welfare analysis shows that the marginal excess burden is sensitive to the estimated love of variety, which overturns classical results on the desirability of ad valorem versus specific taxation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220007
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Migrants at Sea: Unintended Consequences of Search and Rescue Operations,"Claudio Deiana, Vikram Maheshri and Giovanni Mastrobuoni","Many countries are facing and resisting strong migratory pressure, fueling irregular migration. In response to mounting deaths in the Central Mediterranean, European nations intensified rescue operations in 2013. We develop a model of irregular migration to identify the effects of these operations. We find that smugglers responded by sending boats in adverse weather and utilizing flimsy rafts, thus inducing more crossings in dangerous conditions and ultimately offsetting intended safety benefits due to moral hazard. Despite the increased risk, these operations likely increased aggregate migrant welfare; nevertheless, a more successful policy should instead restrict supply of rafts and expand legal alternatives.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220014
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Public Pensions and Private Savings,Esteban Garcia-Miralles and Jonathan Leganza,"How does the provision of public pension benefits impact private savings? We answer this question in the context of a Danish reform that increased social security eligibility ages. Using administrative data and a regression discontinuity design, we identify the causal effects of the policy on savings throughout the financial portfolio. We find increases in contributions to personal and employer-sponsored retirement accounts when delayed benefit eligibility induces extended employment. We argue that inertia—the continuation of previous savings behaviors—is a key mechanism, and we highlight how firm default contribution rate policies can mediate savings responses to social security reform.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220019
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Refugee Benefit Cuts,"Christian Dustmann, Rasmus Landersø and Lars Højsgaard Andersen","This paper analyzes the effects of Denmark's Start Aid welfare reform that targets refugees. Implemented in 2002, it enables us to study not only the reform's immediate effects but also its longer-term consequences and its repeal a decade later. The reform-induced large transfer cuts led to an increase in employment rates, but only in the short run. Overall, the reform increased poverty rates and led to a rise in subsistence crime. Moreover, local demand conditions generate substantial heterogeneity in the reform's effects on immediate and longer-term employment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220062
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Saving Lives with Indexed Disaster Funds: Evidence from Mexico,Alejandro del Valle,"Developing economies are not disproportionately exposed to natural disasters, but they experience significantly more deaths. Exploiting a discontinuity in the eligibility rules for Mexico's indexed disaster fund (Fonden), I show that the accelerated reconstruction of public infrastructure can significantly mitigate the mortality impacts of disasters. Fonden's impact is concentrated in areas with medical infrastructure and among conditions responsive to basic and freely available medical care. These findings suggest that Fonden operates by restoring access to health services. I also show that Fonden is cost-effective relative to other interventions and that its benefit–cost ratio is at least 3.2.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220066
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Understanding the Link between Temperature and Crime,Francois Cohen and Fidel Gonzalez,"The correlation between hot weather and crime is well documented but not fully understood. We combine millions of administrative records, victimization surveys on unreported crime, and daily weather information to analyze the effect of temperatures on crime in Mexico. We find that sample selection cannot explain the observed positive correlation between temperature and crime. Moreover, we find that shifts in alcohol consumption and time use on weekends are responsible for 28 percent of temperature-induced crimes. We also observe changes in the hour and location of crimes, providing new evidence on the importance of time use as a determinant of crime.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220118
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,The Indirect Fiscal Benefits of Low-Skilled Immigration,Mark Colas and Dominik Sachs,Low-skilled immigrants indirectly affect public finances through their effect on resident wages and labor supply. We operationalize this indirect fiscal effect in a model of immigration and the labor market. We derive closed-form expressions for this effect in terms of estimable statistics. An empirical quantification for the United States reveals an indirect fiscal benefit for one average low-skilled immigrant of roughly $750 annually. The indirect fiscal benefit may outweigh the negative direct fiscal effect that has previously been documented. This challenges the perception of low-skilled immigration as a fiscal burden.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220176
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,"Local Retail Prices, Product Variety, and Neighborhood Change","Fernando Borraz, Felipe Carozzi, Nicolás González- Pampillón and Leandro Zipitria","We study how local grocery markets within a city are affected by changes in housing markets. Our empirical strategy exploits a shift in the spatial distribution of construction activity induced by a large-scale, place-based tax exemption in the city of Montevideo. The introduction of new housing stock induced by the policy causes a reduction in grocery prices of 2.3 percent and an increase in locally available product varieties. Using insights from a multiproduct model of imperfect competition and estimates for different types of stores, we show these changes are the result of incumbents' response to an increase in local demand.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210817
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Behavioral Responses to State Income Taxation of High Earners: Evidence from California,Joshua Rauh and Ryan Shyu,"Using administrative data, we analyze the response to Proposition 30, a 2012 measure that increased California marginal tax rates by up to 3 percentage points for high-income households. Relative to baseline departure rates, an additional 0.8 percent of the residential tax base that landed in the top bracket left California in 2013. Using matched out-of-state taxpayers as controls reveals an income elasticity with respect to the marginal net-of-tax rate of 2.5–3.2 for high earners who stayed. These responses eroded 45.2 percent of state windfall tax revenues within the first year and 60.9 percent within 2 years, driven largely by the intensive margin.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200500
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Hassle Costs versus Information: How Do Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs Reduce Opioid Prescribing?,"Abby Alpert, Sarah Dykstra and Mireille Jacobson","We study hassle costs versus information provision in explaining how prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) decrease opioid prescribing. PDMPs aim to reduce opioid prescribing through information provision but may also unintentionally affect prescribing through the hassle of required record checks. We analyze Kentucky's landmark PDMP to disentangle these two mechanisms. Hassle costs reduce opioid prescribing across the board, including to opioid-naive patients; however, physicians continue to prescribe opioids to patients who would benefit the most. Although information also affects prescribing, hassle costs explain the majority of the decline. Introducing a cost to prescribing high-risk medications improves the targeting of treatment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200579
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Fighting Crime in Lawless Areas: Evidence from Slums in Rio de Janeiro,Christophe Bellégo and Joeffrey Drouard,"We use Rio de Janeiro's slum pacification program initiated in 2008 to analyze the effect of policies targeting crime in lawless areas. We correct the bias from the unobserved rise in crime reporting via the use of a proxy variable and bounded variation assumptions. We find that the program reduced the murder and robbery rates but strongly increased the assault and threat rates. We explain these results by providing evidence that increased enforcement weakened the security service that gangs provide on their turf, and may incentivize criminals to switch from serious to less serious crimes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200587
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Does Health Care Consolidation Harm Patients? Evidence from Maternity Ward Closures,"Daniel Avdic, Petter Lundborg and Johan Vikström","We study how closures of maternity wards affect maternal and neonatal health. Using data on all hospital births in Sweden between 1990 and 2004, we compare changes in birth-related outcomes across hospital catchment areas that were differently exposed to ward closures. Our findings show that the closures increased maternal obstetric trauma but also decreased fetal stress and infant trauma among newborns. Adverse maternal outcomes are mainly driven by ward overcrowding, whereas increases in travel distance have no distinguishable effects. Positive effects on infant health reflect a shift of births from smaller to larger wards of higher quality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200734
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Attendance Boundary Policies and the Limits to Combating School Segregation,Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen and Mikkel Gandil,"What is the efficacy of redrawing school attendance boundaries as a desegregation policy? To provide causal evidence on this question, we employ novel data with unprecedented detail on the universe of Danish children and exploit changes in attendance boundaries over time. Households defy reassignments to schools with lower socioeconomic status. There is a strong social gradient in defiance, as resourceful households are more sensitive to the student composition of new schools. We simulate school assignment policies and find that boundary changes that reassign areas to a highly disadvantaged school are ineffective at altering the socioeconomic composition at the disadvantaged school.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200843
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Labor Supply Responses to Income Taxation among Older Couples: Evidence from a Canadian Reform,Derek Messacar,"I assess whether the tax code is a viable policy lever for influencing labor supply among older workers. Specifically, using administrative data from Canada, I estimate the earnings responses to a unique reform that lowered tax burdens for couples with a pensioner, using quasi-experimental methods. I find that workers decrease labor supply as tax bills decline but do not respond to changes in marginal tax rates. Hence, while public policy often aims to keep people in the workforce longer, there are conflicting effects of offering tax advantage for seniors on work incentives. I consider implications of these results for age-dependent taxation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210075
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Increasing the Retirement Age: Policy Effects and Underlying Mechanisms,"Simon Rabate, Egbert Jongen and Tilbe Atav","We study the effects of increasing the statutory retirement age (SRA) in the Netherlands, using regression discontinuity design and administrative data on the universe of the population. We find clear and large employment effects of the reform. A simple model in which individuals stay longer in their pre-SRA labor market state predicts the treatment effects well. The employment level before the SRA and the retirement hazard at the SRA are the key determinants of the effects of the policy change. Exploring potential explanations for the high hazard rate observed in the Netherlands, our results point to an important role for employers' effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210101
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,The Impact of Improving Access to Support Services for Victims of Domestic Violence on Demand for Services and Victim Outcomes,"Martin Foureaux Koppensteiner, Jesse Matheson and Réka Plugor","We conducted a randomized controlled trial of an intervention designed to assist victims of domestic violence in accessing nonpolice support services. The intervention led to a 22 percent decrease in the fraction of victims providing a witness statement to police. Witness statements are an important piece of evidence and a key input in the prosecution of perpetrators. Despite this, we do not find a significant change in perpetrator arrests and convictions or in reported future violence. Survey responses provide evidence of an increase in nonpolice service use and a reduction in future victimization risk, but also a potential decrease in short-run well-being.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210131
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Regulating Privacy Online: An Economic Evaluation of the GDPR,"Samuel G. Goldberg, Garrett A. Johnson and Scott K.

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was intended to make access to such personal data more difficult, with the goal of protecting user privacy. We examine the GDPR's impact on website page views and revenue for 1,084 online firms using data from Adobe's website analytics platform. We find a reduction of 12 percent in both EU user website page views and website revenue recorded by the platform after the GDPR's enforcement deadline.

AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,"The Introduction of the Income Tax, Fiscal Capacity, and Migration: Evidence from US States","Traviss Cassidy, Mark Dincecco and Ugo antonio Troiano","We evaluate how fiscal capacity and migration respond to the introduction of the individual income tax, drawing on new panel data on US states from 1900 to 2010. We find that the introduction of the income tax increased revenue per capita by 12 percent in the short term, 15 percent in the medium term, and 17 percent in the long term. The absolute level of revenue, however, did not significantly change over the long term for post–World War II adopters. To explain this, we show that the introduction of the income tax induced significant outmigration to non-income-tax states by middle- and high-earning households.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210388
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Experimental Evidence on the Effectiveness of Nonexperts for Improving Vaccine Demand,Marcella Alsan and Sarah Eichmeyer,"We experimentally vary signals and senders to identify which combination will increase vaccine demand among a disadvantaged population in the United States—Black and White men without a college education. Our main finding is that laypeople (nonexpert concordant senders) are most effective at promoting vaccination, particularly among those least willing to become vaccinated. This finding points to a trade-off between the higher qualifications of experts on the one hand and the lower social proximity to low-socioeconomic-status populations on the other hand, which may undermine credibility in settings of low trust.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210393
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Addressing Environmental Justice through In-Kind Court Settlements,Pamela Campa and Lucija Muehlenbachs,"In US environmental court cases, a cash penalty can be mitigated if a defendant volunteers to undertake an in-kind project, such as retrofitting school buses or building a public park. A goal of the policy is to address environmental justice concerns for low-income and minority populations, yet the historical record shows in-kind settlements most likely occur in cases involving high-income, majority-White communities. A choice experiment reveals that the public prefers in-kind settlements over cash, and a randomized survey reveals in-kind settlements improve the public's view of a violating firm, consistent with our finding of positive stock market reactions to in-kind settlements.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210432
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,State Taxation of Nonresident Income and the Location of Work,David Agrawal and Kenneth Tester,"Prior studies show that taxes matter for the residential locations of high-income earners. But states raise a significant share of revenue from nonresidents. Using variation in state tax rates, we provide causal evidence on the effect of the net-of-tax rate on the location of labor supply for professional golfers. State taxes induce high-income earners to shift employment to low-tax states without a residence change. The elasticity of working in a state is 0.34 and, consistent with the superstar phenomenon, increases with earnings. Our results suggest a novel margin of mobility responses for top earners: the spatial relocation of labor supply by nonresidents.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210567
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Corporate Taxation and Evasion Responses: Evidence from a Minimum Tax in Honduras,"Felipe Lobel, Thiago Scot and Pedro Zúniga","We study corporate responses to a minimum income tax, using the universe of corporate tax filings in Honduras. The policy design allows us to separately estimate cost misreporting under profit taxation and the elasticity of reported revenue. Large corporations overreport true costs when taxed on profits. Taxing revenue leads to a substantial decrease in reported revenues: we estimate an elasticity in the range 0.35–1. The elasticity of revenue is attenuated when third-party information on the revenue of firms is available, suggesting misreporting plays an important role. Our results inform trade-offs when broadening tax bases to curb evasion.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210587
AEJ: Economic Policy,2024,Mandatory Retirement for Judges Improved the Performance of US State Supreme Courts,Elliott Ash and W.

We find that introducing mandatory retirement improves court performance as measured by output (number of opinions) and legal influence (number of citations to opinions). While older judges are cited less than younger judges, the effect of mandatory retirement is larger than what is expected from a change in the age distribution. We find some evidence that the additional effect is due to selective attrition and that the presence of older judges reduces the performance of younger judges.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210667
