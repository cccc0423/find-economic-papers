Journal of Finance,2023,CLO Performance,"Larry Cordell, Michael R. Roberts and Michael Schwert","We study the performance of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) to understand the market imperfections giving rise to these vehicles and their corresponding economic costs. CLO equity tranches earn positive abnormal returns from the risk‐adjusted price differential between leveraged loans and CLO debt tranches. Debt tranches offer higher returns than similarly rated corporate bonds, making them attractive to banks and insurers that face risk‐based capital requirements. Temporal variation in equity performance highlights the resilience of CLOs to market volatility due to their closed‐end structure, long‐term funding, and embedded options to reinvest principal proceeds.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13224
Journal of Finance,2023,Pockets of Predictability,"Leland Farmer, Lawrence Schmidt and Allan Timmermann","For many benchmark predictor variables, short‐horizon return predictability in the U.S. stock market is local in time as short periods with significant predictability (“pockets”) are interspersed with long periods with no return predictability. We document this result empirically using a flexible time‐varying parameter model that estimates predictive coefficients as a nonparametric function of time and explore possible explanations of this finding, including time‐varying risk premia for which we find limited support. Conversely, pockets of return predictability are consistent with a sticky expectations model in which investors slowly update their beliefs about a persistent component in the cash flow process.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13229
Journal of Finance,2023,The Pollution Premium,"Po‐hsuan Hsu, Kai Li and Chi‐yang Tsou","This paper studies the asset pricing implications of industrial pollution. A long‐short portfolio constructed from firms with high versus low toxic emission intensity within an industry generates an average annual return of 4.42%, which remains significant after controlling for risk factors. This pollution premium cannot be explained by existing systematic risks, investor preferences, market sentiment, political connections, or corporate governance. We propose and model a new systematic risk related to environmental policy uncertainty. We use the growth in environmental litigation penalties to measure regime change risk and find that it helps price the cross section of emission portfolios' returns.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13217
Journal of Finance,2023,Duration‐Driven Returns,Niels Gormsen and Eben Lazarus,"We propose a duration‐based explanation for the premia on major equity factors, including value, profitability, investment, low‐risk, and payout factors. These factors invest in firms that earn most of their cash flows in the near future and could therefore be driven by a premium on near‐future cash flows. We test this hypothesis using a novel data set of single‐stock dividend futures, which are claims on dividends of individual firms. Consistent with our hypothesis, the expected Capital Asset Pricing Model alpha on individual cash flows decreases in maturity within a firm, and the alpha is not related to the above characteristics when controlling for maturity.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13216
Journal of Finance,2023,Firm‐Level Climate Change Exposure,"Zacharias Sautner, Laurence van Lent, Grigory Vilkov and Ruishen Zhang","We develop a method that identifies the attention paid by earnings call participants to firms' climate change exposures. The method adapts a machine learning keyword discovery algorithm and captures exposures related to opportunity, physical, and regulatory shocks associated with climate change. The measures are available for more than 10,000 firms from 34 countries between 2002 and 2020. We show that the measures are useful in predicting important real outcomes related to the net‐zero transition, in particular, job creation in disruptive green technologies and green patenting, and that they contain information that is priced in options and equity markets.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13219
Journal of Finance,2023,Macroeconomic News in Asset Pricing and Reality,Greg Duffee,"Revisions in successive Greenbook forecasts of quarterly real GDP growth proxy for news of current and expected future economic growth. In the sample 1975 through 2015, news of future growth is slightly negatively related to contemporaneous changes in Treasury bond yields, while news of current growth is strongly positively related to changes in these yields. Both results are difficult to reconcile with a representative agent's bondholding first‐order condition. A continuous‐time dynamic model of output attributes almost all of the covariation with yields to martingale innovations in log output and a minimal amount to innovations in the conditional drift of log output.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13218
Journal of Finance,2023,Who Owns What? A Factor Model for Direct Stockholding,"Vimal Balasubramaniam, John Campbell, Tarun Ramadorai and Benjamin Ranish","We build a cross‐sectional factor model for investors' direct stockholdings and estimate it using data from almost 10 million retail accounts in the Indian stock market. Our model identifies strong investor clienteles for stock characteristics, most notably firm age and share price, and for particular clusters of stock characteristics. These clienteles are intuitively associated with investor attributes such as account age, size, and diversification. Coheld stocks tend to have higher return covariance, inconsistent with simple models of diversification but suggestive that clientele demands influence stock returns.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13220
Journal of Finance,2023,Integrating Factor Models,"Doron Avramov, Si Cheng, Lior Metzker and Stefan Voigt","This paper develops a comprehensive framework to address uncertainty about the correct factor model. Asset pricing inferences draw on a composite model that integrates over competing factor models weighted by posterior probabilities. Evidence shows that unconditional models record near‐zero probabilities, while postearnings announcement drift, quality‐minus‐junk, and intermediary capital are potent factors in conditional asset pricing. Out‐of‐sample, the integrated model performs well, tilting away from subsequently underperforming factors. Model uncertainty makes equities appear considerably riskier, while model disagreement about expected returns spikes during crash episodes. Disagreement spans all return components involving mispricing, factor loadings, and risk premia.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13226
Journal of Finance,2023,Visibility Bias in the Transmission of Consumption Beliefs and Undersaving,"Bing Han, David Hirshleifer and Johan Walden","We model visibility bias in the social transmission of consumption behavior. When consumption is more salient than nonconsumption, people perceive that others are consuming heavily, and infer that future prospects are favorable. This increases aggregate consumption in a positive feedback loop. A distinctive implication is that disclosure policy interventions can ameliorate undersaving. In contrast with wealth‐signaling models, information asymmetry about wealth reduces overconsumption. The model predicts that saving is influenced by social connectedness, observation biases, and demographic structure, and provides new insight into savings rates. These predictions are distinct from other common models of consumption distortions.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13223
Journal of Finance,2023,Naïve Buying Diversification and Narrow Framing by Individual Investors,"John Gathergood, David Hirshleifer, David Leake, Hiroaki Sakaguchi and Neil Stewart","We provide the first tests to distinguish whether individual investors equally balance their overall portfolios (naïve portfolio diversification, NPD) or, in contrast, equally balance the values of same‐day purchases of multiple assets (naïve buying diversification, NBD). We find NBD in purchases of multiple stocks, and in mixed purchases of individual stocks and funds. In contrast, there is little evidence of NPD. Evidence suggests that NBD arises due to stock picking behavior and neglect of diversification. These findings suggest that behavioral finance theory should incorporate transaction, as well as portfolio, framing.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13222
Journal of Finance,2023,Model Comparison with Transaction Costs,"Andrew Detzel, Robert Novy‐marx and Mihail Velikov","Failing to account for transaction costs materially impacts inferences drawn when evaluating asset pricing models, biasing tests in favor of those employing high‐cost factors. Ignoring transaction costs, Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015, Review of Financial Studies, 28, 650–705) q‐factor model and Barillas and Shanken (2018, The Journal of Finance, 73, 715–754) six‐factor models have high maximum squared Sharpe ratios and small alphas across 205 anomalies. They do not, however, come close to spanning the achievable mean‐variance efficient frontier. Accounting for transaction costs, the Fama and French (2015, Journal of Financial Economics, 116, 1–22; 2018, Journal of Financial Economics, 128, 234–252) five‐factor model has a significantly higher squared Sharpe ratio than either of these alternative models, while variations employing cash profitability perform better still.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13225
Journal of Finance,2023,Did FinTech Lenders Facilitate PPP Fraud?,"John M. Griffin, Samuel Kruger and Prateek Mahajan","In the $793 billion Paycheck Protection Program, we examine metrics related to potential misreporting including nonregistered businesses, multiple businesses at residential addresses, abnormally high implied compensation per employee, and large inconsistencies with jobs reported in another government program. These measures consistently concentrate in certain FinTech lenders and are cross‐verified by seven additional measures. FinTech market share increased significantly over time, and suspicious lending by FinTechs in 2021 is four times the level at the start of the program. Suspicious loans are being overwhelmingly forgiven at rates similar to other loans.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13209
Journal of Finance,2023,Pricing Currency Risks,"Mikhail Chernov, Magnus Dahlquist and Lars Lochstoer","The currency market features a small cross‐section, and conditional expected returns can be characterized by few signals: interest differential, trend, and mean reversion. We exploit these properties to construct the ex ante mean‐variance efficient portfolio of individual currencies. The portfolio is updated in real time and prices all prominent currency trading strategies, conditionally and unconditionally. The fraction of risk in these assets that does not affect their risk premiums is at least 85%. Extant explanations of carry strategies based on intermediary capital or global volatility are related to these unpriced components, while consumption growth is related to the priced component of returns.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13190
Journal of Finance,2023,A Model of Systemic Bank Runs,Xuewen Liu,"We develop a tractable model of systemic bank runs. The market‐based banking system features a two‐layer structure: banks with heterogeneous fundamentals face potential runs by their creditors while they trade short‐term funding in the asset (interbank) market in response to creditor withdrawals. The possibility of a run on a particular bank depends on its assets' interim liquidation value, and this value depends endogenously in turn on the status of other banks in the asset market. The within‐bank coordination problem among creditors and the cross‐bank price externality feed into each other. A small shock can be amplified into a systemic crisis.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13213
Journal of Finance,2023,Biased Auctioneers,"Mathieu Aubry, Roman Kräussl, Gustavo Manso and Christophe Spaenjers","We construct a neural network algorithm that generates price predictions for art at auction, relying on both visual and nonvisual object characteristics. We find that higher automated valuations relative to auction house presale estimates are associated with substantially higher price‐to‐estimate ratios and lower buy‐in rates, pointing to estimates' informational inefficiency. The relative contribution of machine learning is higher for artists with less dispersed and lower average prices. Furthermore, we show that auctioneers' prediction errors are persistent both at the artist and at the auction house level, and hence directly predictable themselves using information on past errors.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13203
Journal of Finance,2023,Discount‐Rate Risk in Private Equity: Evidence from Secondary Market Transactions,"Brian H. Boyer, Taylor D. Nadauld, Keith P. Vorkink and Michael Weisbach","Measures of private equity (PE) performance based on cash flows do not account for a discount‐rate risk premium that is a component of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) alpha. We create secondary market PE indices and find that PE discount rates vary considerably. Net asset values are too smooth because they fail to reflect variation in discount rates. Although the CAPM alpha for our index is zero, the generalized public market equivalent based on cash flows is large and positive. We obtain similar results for a set of synthetic funds that invest in small cap stocks. Ignoring variation in PE discount rates can lead to a misallocation of capital.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13202
Journal of Finance,2023,Do Municipal Bond Dealers Give Their Customers “Fair and Reasonable” Pricing?,"John M. Griffin, Nicholas Hirschey and Samuel Kruger","Municipal bonds exhibit considerable retail pricing variation, even for same‐size trades of the same bond on the same day, and even from the same dealer. Markups vary widely across dealers. Trading strongly clusters on eighth price increments, and clustered trades exhibit higher markups. Yields are often lowered to just above salient numbers. Machine learning estimates exploiting the richness of the data show that dealers that use strategic pricing have systematically higher markups. Recent Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board rules have had only a limited impact on markups. While a subset of dealers focus on best execution, many dealers appear focused on opportunistic pricing.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13214
Journal of Finance,2023,Information Aggregation via Contracting,Jiasun Li,"When a group of investors with dispersed private information jointly invest in a risky project, how should they divide the project's profit? We show that a simple contract dividing profits in proportion to investors' risk tolerances may facilitate information aggregation by altering investors' risk‐taking incentives when they decide on how investment strategies respond to private information. Our results provide a contracting‐based approach for information aggregation, which is an alternative to learning from endogenous market variables (e.g., prices) via contingent schedules as seen in well‐known rational expectations equilibrium models.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13205
Journal of Finance,2023,Equilibrium Bitcoin Pricing,"Bruno Biais, Christophe Bisière, Matthieu Bouvard, Catherine Casamatta and Albert Menkveld","We offer a general equilibrium analysis of cryptocurrency pricing. The fundamental value of the cryptocurrency is its stream of net transactional benefits, which depend on its future prices. This implies that, in addition to fundamentals, equilibrium prices reflect sunspots. This in turn implies multiple equilibria and extrinsic volatility, that is, cryptocurrency prices fluctuate even when fundamentals are constant. To match our model to the data, we construct indices measuring the net transactional benefits of Bitcoin. In our calibration, part of the variations in Bitcoin returns reflects changes in net transactional benefits, but a larger share reflects extrinsic volatility.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13206
Journal of Finance,2023,"Local Experiences, Search, and Spillovers in the Housing Market","Antonio Gargano, Marco Giacoletti and Elvis Jarnecic","Recent local price growth explains differences in search behavior across prospective homebuyers. Those experiencing higher growth in their postcode of residence search more broadly across locations and house characteristics, without changing attention devoted to individual sales listings, and have shorter search duration. Effects are stronger for homeowners, in particular those living in less wealthy areas and looking for a new primary residence. We use reduced‐form analysis and a quantitative equilibrium model to show that the expansion of search breadth translates into widespread spillovers onto house sales prices and inventories of listings across postcodes within a metropolitan area.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13208
Journal of Finance,2023,Model Secrecy and Stress Tests,Yaron Leitner and Basil Williams,"Should regulators reveal the models they use to stress‐test banks? In our setting, revealing leads to gaming, but secrecy can induce banks to underinvest in socially desirable assets for fear of failing the test. We show that although the regulator can solve this underinvestment problem by making the test easier, some disclosure may still be optimal (e.g., if banks have high appetite for risk or if capital shortfalls are not very costly). Cutoff rules are optimal within monotone disclosure rules, but more generally optimal disclosure is single‐peaked. We discuss policy implications and offer applications beyond stress tests.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13207
Journal of Finance,2023,The Gender Gap in Housing Returns,Paul Goldsmith‐pinkham and Kelly Shue,"Using detailed transactions data across the United States, we find that single women earn 1.5 percentage points lower annualized returns on housing relative to single men. Forty‐five percent of the gap is explained by transaction timing and location. The remaining gap arises from a 2% gender difference in execution prices at purchase and sale. Consistent with a negotiation channel, women list for less and experience worse negotiated discounts. The gender gap shrinks in tight markets, where negotiation is replaced by quasi‐auctions. Overall, gender differences in housing explain 30% of the gender gap in wealth accumulation for the median household.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13212
Journal of Finance,2023,Monetary Stimulus amidst the Infrastructure Investment Spree: Evidence from China's Loan‐Level Data,"Kaiji Chen, Haoyu Gao, Patrick Higgins, Daniel Waggoner and Tao Zha","We study how a fiscal expansion via infrastructure investment influences the dynamic impacts of monetary stimulus on credit allocation. We develop a two‐stage approach and apply it to the Chinese economy with a confidential loan‐level data set that covers all sectors. We find that infrastructure investment significantly weakened monetary policy's transmission to credit allocated to private firms, while reinforcing the monetary effects on loans to state‐owned firms. This fiscal‐monetary interaction channel is key to understanding the preferential credit access enjoyed by state‐owned firms during the stimulus period. Consequently, monetary stimulus crowded out private investment and decreased capital allocation efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13204

Journal of Finance,2023,Optimal Financial Transaction Taxes,Eduardo Davila,"This paper characterizes the optimal transaction tax in an equilibrium model of financial markets. If investors hold heterogeneous beliefs unrelated to their fundamental trading motives and the planner calculates welfare using any single belief, a positive tax is optimal, regardless of the magnitude of fundamental trading. Under some conditions, the optimal tax is independent of the planner's belief. The optimal tax can be implemented by adjusting its value until total volume equals fundamental volume. Knowledge of (i) the share of nonfundamental trading volume and (ii) the semielasticity of trading volume to tax changes is sufficient to quantify the optimal tax.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13188
Journal of Finance,2023,"Less Mainstream Credit, More Payday Borrowing? Evidence from Debt Collection Restrictions",Julia Fonseca,"Governments regulate debt collectors to protect consumers from predatory practices. These restrictions may lower repayment, reducing the supply of mainstream credit and increasing demand for alternative credit. Using individual credit record data and a difference‐in‐differences design comparing consumers in states that tighten restrictions on debt collection to those in neighboring states that do not, I find that restricting collections reduces access to mainstream credit and increases payday borrowing. These findings provide new evidence of substitution between alternative and mainstream credit and point to a trade‐off between shielding consumers from certain collection practices and pushing them into higher cost payday lending markets.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13189
Journal of Finance,2023,Disruption and Credit Markets,Bo Becker and Victoria Ivashina,"We show that over the past half‐century, innovative disruptions were central to understanding corporate defaults. In a given year, industries experiencing abnormally high venture capital or initial public offering activity subsequently see higher default rates, higher segment exits by conglomerates, and higher yields on bonds issued by the firms in these industries. Overall, we find that disruption is a broad phenomenon, negatively affecting incumbent firms across the spectrum of age, valuation, and levers, with the exception of very large and low‐leverage firms, in line with our central hypothesis.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13187

In contrast to equity dividends, total corporate payouts are highly volatile, turn negative when corporations raise capital, and are acyclical. At the same time, corporate asset returns are similar to returns on equity, and both are exposed to fluctuations in economic growth. To reconcile this evidence, we argue that acyclical but volatile net repurchases mask the exposure of total payouts' cash components to economic growth risks. We develop an asset pricing framework to quantitatively illustrate this economic channel.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13196
Journal of Finance,2023,International Yield Curves and Currency Puzzles,Mikhail Chernov and Drew Creal,"The currency depreciation rate is often computed as the ratio of foreign to domestic pricing kernels. Using bond prices alone to estimate these kernels leads to currency puzzles: the inability of models to match violations of uncovered interest parity and the volatility of exchange rates. This happens because of the FX bond disconnect, the inability of bonds to span exchange rates. Incorporating innovations to the pricing kernel that affect exchange rates but not bonds helps resolve the puzzles. This approach also allows one to relate news about cross‐country differences between international yields to news about currency risk premiums.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13191
Journal of Finance,2023,Decentralization through Tokenization,Michael Sockin and Wei Xiong,"We examine decentralization of digital platforms through tokenization as an innovation to resolve the conflict between platforms and users. By delegating control to users, tokenization through utility tokens acts as a commitment device that prevents a platform from exploiting users. This commitment comes at the cost of not having an owner with an equity stake who, in conventional platforms, would subsidize participation to maximize the platform's network effect. This trade‐off makes utility tokens a more appealing funding scheme than equity for platforms with weak fundamentals. The conflict reappears when nonusers, such as token investors and validators, participate on the platform.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13192

Moskowitz and Kaushik Vasudevan","Deviations from the law of one price between futures and spot prices—the futures‐cash basis—capture information about liquidity demand for equity market exposure in global markets. We show that the basis comoves with dealer and investor futures positions, is contemporaneously positively correlated with futures and spot market returns, and negatively predicts futures and spot returns. These findings are consistent with the futures‐cash basis reflecting liquidity demand that is common to futures and cash equity markets. We find persistent supply‐demand imbalances for equity index exposure reflected in the basis, giving rise to an annual premium of 5% to 6%.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13198
Journal of Finance,2023,Principal Portfolios,"Bryan Kelly, Semyon Malamud and Lasse Heje Pedersen","We propose a new asset pricing framework in which all securities' signals predict each individual return. While the literature focuses on securities' own‐signal predictability, assuming equal strength across securities, our framework includes cross‐predictability—leading to three main results. First, we derive the optimal strategy in closed form. It consists of eigenvectors of a “prediction matrix,” which we call “principal portfolios.” Second, we decompose the problem into alpha and beta, yielding optimal strategies with, respectively, zero and positive factor exposure. Third, we provide a new test of asset pricing models. Empirically, principal portfolios deliver significant out‐of‐sample alphas to standard factors in several data sets.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13199
Journal of Finance,2023,Small Business Equity Returns: Empirical Evidence from the Business Credit Card Securitization Market,Matthias Fleckenstein and Francis A. Longstaff,We present a new approach for estimating small business equity returns. This approach applies the Merton (1974) credit model to the returns on entrepreneurial business credit card debt securitizations and solves for the implied equity returns for the small businesses owned by the cardholders. The estimated small business equity premium is 10.74%. The standard deviation of small business equity returns is 56.37%. We validate the methodology by applying it to investment‐grade corporate bonds and recovering a public equity premium of 6.17%.,https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13200
Journal of Finance,2023,Beliefs Aggregation and Return Predictability,"Albert S. Kyle, Anna A. Obizhaeva and Yajun Wang","We study return predictability using a model of speculative trading among competitive traders who agree to disagree about the precision of private information. Although traders apply Bayes' Law consistently, returns are predictable. In addition to trading on long‐term fundamental value, traders also trade on perceived short‐term opportunities arising from foreseen future disagreement, as in a Keynesian beauty contest. Contradicting conventional wisdom, this short‐term speculation dampens price fluctuations and generates time‐series momentum. Model calibration shows quantitatively realistic patterns of return dynamics. Consistent with empirical evidence, our model predicts more pronounced momentum for stocks with higher trading volume.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13195

For a (potentially misspecified) stand‐alone model, it provides reliable price of risk estimates for both tradable and nontradable factors, and detects those weakly identified. For competing factors and (possibly nonnested) models, the method automatically selects the best specification—if a dominant one exists—or provides a Bayesian model averaging–stochastic discount factor (BMA‐SDF), if there is no clear winner. We analyze 2.25 quadrillion models generated by a large set of factors and find that the BMA‐SDF outperforms existing models in‐ and out‐of‐sample.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13197
