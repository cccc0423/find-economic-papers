Journal of Public Economics,2023,Encouragement and distortionary effects of conditional cash transfers,"Gharad Bryan, Shyamal Chowdhury, Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, Melanie Morten and Joeri Smits","Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs aim to reduce poverty or advance social goals by encouraging desirable behavior that recipients under-invest in. An unintended consequence of conditionality may be the distortion of recipients’ behavior in ways that lower welfare. We first illustrate a range of potential distortions arising from CCT programs around the world. We then show that in the simple case where a CCT causes low return participants to select into a behavior, and social returns and private perceived returns are aligned, transfer size plays an important role: the larger the transfer, the stronger the distortion becomes, implying that (i) there is an optimal transfer size for such CCTs, and (ii) unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) may be better than CCTs when the transfer amount is large. We provide empirical evidence consistent with these claims by studying a cash transfer program conditional on seasonal labor migration in rural Indonesia. In line with theory, we show that when the transfer size exceeds the amount required for travel expenses, distortionary effects dominate and migration earnings decrease.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272300186X
Journal of Public Economics,2023,The market-level effects of charter schools on student outcomes: A national analysis of school districts,Feng Chen and Douglas N. Harris,"We study the total, market-level effects of charter schools, and their mechanisms, on a national level and across multiple outcomes. Using a generalized difference-in-differences method, we find that increasing the charter market share by 10 percentage points increases math and ELA elementary/middle test scores of the entire geographic district in which they locate by 0.01 standard deviations and increases the high school graduation rate by 1–2 percentage points. The effects are concentrated in larger, urban districts. The main mechanism appears to be the participant effect, though competitive effects are increasing in the participant effect and driven partly by the closure of low-performing traditional public schools. Causal interpretation of these findings is reinforced by analysis of potential endogeneity of charter school location and timing using placebo analysis and other methods. This study improves understanding of the array of charter mechanisms and their effects on multiple outcomes, on a national basis.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001974

Rivkin, Tim R. Sass and Katharine O. Strunk","We use administrative panel data from seven states covering nearly 3 million students to document and explore variation in “academic mobility,” a term we use to describe the extent to which students’ ranks in the distribution of academic performance change during their public schooling careers. We find that student ranks are highly persistent during elementary and secondary education—that is, academic mobility is limited in U.S. schools on the whole. Still, there is non-negligible variation in the degree of upward mobility across some student subgroups as well as individual school districts. On average, districts that exhibit the greatest upward academic mobility serve more socioeconomically advantaged populations and have higher value-added to student achievement.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001986
Journal of Public Economics,2023,"What we pay in the shadows: Labor tax evasion, minimum wage hike and employment",Nicolas Gavoille and Anna Zasova,"The interactions between minimum wage policy and tax evasion remain largely unknown. We study the firm-level employment effects of a large and biting minimum wage increase in the context of widespread wage underreporting. We apply machine learning to classify firms as either tax-compliant or tax-evading. We then show that firms engaged in labor tax evasion are insensitive to the minimum wage shock. Our results indicate that these firms use wage underreporting as an adjustment margin, converting part of their formerly undeclared cash payments into official wages. Increasing the minimum wage improves tax enforcement, but comes at the cost of negative employment consequences for compliant firms.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002098

We study how this is affected by the simultaneous presence of multiple biases arising from different sources, through a field experiment on resource conservation in an energy- and water-intensive everyday activity (showering). One intervention, shower energy reports, primarily targeted knowledge about environmental impacts; another intervention, real-time feedback, primarily targeted salience of resource use. We find a striking complementarity. While only the latter induced significant conservation effects when implemented in isolation, each intervention became more effective when implemented jointly. This is consistent with predictions from a theoretical framework that highlights the importance of targeting all relevant sources of bias to achieve behavioral change.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002104
Journal of Public Economics,2023,"Organized crime, violence and support for the state","Gian Maria Campedelli, Gianmarco Daniele, Andrea Martinangeli and Paolo Pinotti","Citizens’ support is crucial to effectively combat organized crime, a substantial threat to many countries. Contrary to prior studies identifying a negative correlation between crime and trust in the state, studying a representative sample of 5374 individuals in Italy we find that exposing the participants to journalistic images of organized crime-related violence increases trust towards institutions and state performance (measured by donations to a governmental as opposed to a non-governmental organization), perceived institutional quality, and trust in political institutions. This is remarkable considering that the participants are overly pessimistic about trends in violence: About two-thirds believe that mafia-related homicides and total homicides increased in Italy over the last two decades, and half believe that they increased by over 20%, while in reality both types of homicides declined by over 60%. These findings are relevant for governments and organizations interested in non-repressive methods to fight criminal organizations, as they underscore the potential impact of media narratives on shaping public attitudes toward crime and state authorities.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002116

Evidence and mechanisms,"Han Li, Jiangyi Li, Yi Lu and Huihua Xie","This study analyzes the effects of housing policies on child development. By exploiting the policy-induced discontinuity in house size in China, we find that favorable housing policies significantly reduce children’s cognitive skills, lessen their beliefs in an internal locus of control, and decrease their self-esteem but have little impact on their physical health or depression symptoms. The heterogeneous analyses show that children at a critical stage of skill formation, girls and children with longer exposure respond more strongly to housing policies. Furthermore, our mechanism decomposition shows that parenting skills play a large role in the effect of housing wealth on child development.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001779
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Uncovering illegal and underground economies: The case of mafia extortion racketeering,Lavinia Piemontese,"I propose a new approach to quantify the economic cost of hidden economies and apply it to the case of mafia extortion in Northern Italy. To quantify the extortion rate, unobserved in the data, I first show that extortion racketeering is linked to resource misallocation. Then, I implement a structural estimation based on matching the observed misallocation in markets defined as mafia-infiltrated, with that predicted from a model whose parameters are estimated using data on non-mafia markets or calibrated from the literature. The results suggest that the share of output that the mafia extorts from firms ranges between 0.5 and 5 percent of firm-level output for those firms that are subject to extortion, with an implied loss between 0.6 and 8 percent of aggregate value added.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001792

This paper formalizes this intuition and test it on Italian electoral data, using the 1991 electoral reform as an exogenous source of variation in electoral competition in one of the two branches of the Parliament. Our triple-difference estimates suggest that after the reform mafia-prone areas reported higher vote shares awarded to the party traditionally supported by criminal organizations only for the branch affected by the reform, and a larger dispersion of votes across candidates of the same party.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001809
Journal of Public Economics,2023,"Tax wedges, financial frictions and misallocation","Árpád Ábrahám, Piero Gottardi, Joachim Hubmer and Lukas Mayr","We revisit the classical result that in a closed economy the incidence of corporate taxes on labor is approximately zero. We consider a rich general equilibrium framework, where agents differ in the level of their wealth as well as in their managerial and working ability. Potential entrepreneurs go through all the key decisions affected by corporate tax changes: the choice of (i) occupation, (ii) organizational form, (iii) investment, and (iv) financing structure. We allow both for the presence of financial frictions and the traditional tax advantage of debt over corporate equity, which jointly generate misallocation of capital and talent. In this environment we characterize the effects of increasing corporate taxes both analytically and for a calibrated version of the model. We show that this tax increase reallocates production from C corporations to pass-through businesses. Since, due to distorted prices, the latter have higher capital-labor ratios, this reallocation generates a reduction in labor productivity and wages. Furthermore, the corporate tax increase induces some C corporations to reorganize as pass-throughs, which implies more restricted access to external funds and thus a socially inefficient downsizing of production in these firms. Finally, the tax increase causes further misallocation of talent by inducing agents with low wealth relative to their managerial talent to switch from entrepreneurship to being workers, while the reverse happens for agents with higher wealth and lower managerial skills. Overall, we find that both labor and capital bear a large share of the corporate tax incidence, while entrepreneurs are net beneficiaries of the tax change.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001822
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Kosher Pork,Allan Drazen and Ethan Ilzetzki,"There are two common views of pork barrel spending. One is that pork barrel spending benefits special interests at the expense of social welfare, hence antithetical to responsible policy making, especially in times of crisis. An alternative is that pork “greases the legislative wheels” making possible the enactment of socially beneficial legislation that would otherwise not pass. In this paper we reexamine both arguments and show that they depend on the nature of heterogeneity of interests and information across legislators. Under full information, but with heterogeneous ideology, policy compromise may be sufficient to pass beneficial legislation. Pork typically reduces welfare as in the conventional wisdom, but we also characterize cases where pork can indeed “grease the wheels” and improve social welfare. When agents are heterogeneous not only in their ideology, but also their information, allocation of pork may be crucial to passage of legislation appropriate to the situation. It does so not simply by inducing legislators to accept legislation they view as harmful, but also by conveying information about the necessity of policy change, where it may be impossible to convey such information in the absence of pork. Moreover, pork will be observed when the public good is most valuable precisely because it is valuable and the informed agenda setter wants to convey this information. Moreover, information may be conveyed for the reason pork is widely criticized, that is, because it benefits special interests.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001834
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Measuring take-up of the California EITC with state administrative data,"John Iselin, Taylor Mackay and Matthew Unrath","The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is the largest cash-based means-tested transfer program in the United States. In 2021, 31 million households received $64 billion from the federal EITC. Twenty-eight states also offer eligible taxpayers a supplement to the federal program. An estimated one-fifth of eligible households fail to claim the federal credit, but little is known about take-up of these state programs. We use administrative data from California on the population of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients linked to state tax records to estimate the number of households who are eligible for California’s supplement to the federal EITC (CalEITC) but do not claim it. We find that over 400,000 households who received SNAP benefits and who were eligible for the state EITC in 2017 did not receive the credit. This includes approximately 40,000 eligible households who claimed the federal EITC but not the state credit; nearly 98,000 eligible households who filed a state tax return but did not claim the state or federal credit; and roughly 270,000 eligible households who did not file a state tax return. The corresponding take-up rate for the CalEITC among eligible SNAP-enrolled households was 54%. Altogether, these households left a total of $71 million in state EITC funds on the table. If received, these credits would have increased incomes among these households by 2.7% and increased total state EITC outlays by 20%.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001846

We exploit daily variation in Bitcoin price as a natural experiment for an 86 megawatt waste coal-fired power plant with on-site cryptomining. We find that carbon emissions respond swiftly to mining incentives, with price elasticities of 0.69–0.71 in the short-run and 0.33–0.40 in the longer run. A $1 increase in Bitcoin price leads to $3.11–$6.79 in external damages from carbon emissions alone, well exceeding cryptomining’s value added (using a $190 social cost of carbon, but ignoring increased local air pollution). As cryptomining requires ever more computing power to mine a given number of blocks, our study highlights both the revitalization of US fossil assets and the need for financial industry accounting to incorporate cryptomining externalities.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001858

The outlet, which is primarily driven by profit maximization, has an incentive to induce uncertainty in order to encourage future consultation and thereby generate revenue.

The research design exploited the generalized wage growth induced by changes in the contractual pay levels, whose timing and size differ across collective agreements. The specification adopted compared the outcomes of interest within sectors and geographical locations, and among workers subject to different collective contracts. The study results show that contractual wage growth raised the actual pay levels and had significant negative effects on employment.

Results show air quality improvements through reductions in traffic-related pollutants despite ground-level ozone increases and harmful spatial pollution spillovers.

Journal of Public Economics,2023,Behavioral cross-influence of a shadow tax bracket: Evidence from bunching where income tax liabilities start,Raphaël Lardeux,"Prediction of tax revenue must account for earnings responses with respect to all perceived incentives, whether they are effective or not. This paper explores the extent to which tax filers respond to irrelevant incentives and develops an identification procedure for the behavioral cross-influence (BCI), a behavioral elasticity created by Farhi and Gabaix (2020) to capture such responses. Relying on French income tax returns from 2008 to 2014, the BCI is identified from earnings responses to a shadow tax bracket located just below the threshold where French income tax liabilities start. Even tax filers who used to correctly optimize their taxable income react to an increase in irrelevant tax incentives. Far from being zero, the BCI represents between 56 % and 78 % of the elasticity of taxable income with respect to perceived incentives. Standard analysis restricted to effective incentives would underestimate this elasticity of taxable income by 60 %. Tax filers who face higher stakes are less likely to be misled by irrelevant incentives.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001329

Our analysis highlights two major aspects of this decision. First, an asymmetric treatment of project gains and losses in the home country creates an incentive to transfer IP to a foreign low-tax country to avoid potentially negative profits at home. These incentives exist even when IP is priced at a fair arms-length price and are further strengthened in the presence of R&D tax incentives. Second, when multinationals have private information about the probability of project success, they have an incentive to transfer their most promising IP ex ante.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001494
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Earnings information and public preferences for university tuition: Evidence from representative experiments,Philipp Lergetporer and Ludger Woessmann,"Higher education finance depends on the public’s preferences for charging tuition, which may be partly based on beliefs and awareness about the university earnings premium. To test whether public support for tuition depends on earnings information, we devise survey experiments in representative samples of the German electorate (N > 15,000). The electorate is divided, with a plurality opposing tuition. Providing information on the university earnings premium raises support for tuition by 7 percentage points, turning the plurality in favor. The opposition-reducing effect persists two weeks after treatment. While there is some evidence of information-based updating of biased beliefs, the effect seems to mainly work through increased salience which triggers reduced consideration of financial constraints when forming preferences for tuition. Information on fiscal costs and unequal access does not affect public preferences.

To estimate the effect of awareness, we leverage a field experiment randomizing information about the mere existence of the fiscal incentives.

Further, we find increased awareness induces consumers to purchase vehicles that consume less fuel.

Based on bunching estimates, I measure that 10% of layoffs in an 4-week window before the threshold are delayed, creating a bunching mass on the high-benefit side of the cutoff. Examining the mechanisms, the evidence suggests that employers and employees bargain over contract termination. Taken together, employers and employees show sophisticated reactions to UI with effects on employment duration. However, this retiming response accounts for a very small share of the fiscal externality of differentiating UI benefits at a tenure threshold, relative to the moral hazard cost.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001664

Voters have private information about their policy preferences. Only upon the failure of the initial proposal does the setter have a chance to revise it and call for a re-vote. The status quo gets implemented if the revised proposal fails. We establish the existence of an informative equilibrium for any number of voters and any q-rule, where the first-period voting enables the voters to signal their policy preferences and the setter makes a more compromising proposal upon more negative votes. We apply the model to identify important sources that improve political outcomes regarding individuals’ welfare and policy progress. Specifically, we show that the setter’s reconsideration opportunity improves her welfare and alleviates policy gridlock, which is defined as the outcome of no policy change. Meanwhile, the information revealed through voting can also benefit the voters, provided that the setter is sufficiently constrained by the voting rule. In addition, voters’ less sophistication can not only make a further Pareto improvement for themselves and the setter but can also avoid policy gridlock to a larger extent.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001676

Journal of Public Economics,2023,The disparate effects of information provision: A field experiment on the work incentives of social welfare,Sofie Cairo and Robert Mahlstedt,"Recipients of transfer payments must navigate intricate rules and regulations governing their incentives. This complexity carries the risk of prompting them to make privately suboptimal decisions and may, in turn, reduce overall welfare. Combining data from a large-scale scale field experiment and detailed administrative records, we investigate the labor market effects of informing social welfare recipients about their work incentives resulting from a minimum work requirement. Our intervention employs two treatments that provide (1) personalized and continually updated information on the relevant number of hours individuals have worked in the past and (2) generic information about the general rules governing their incentives. We find that the labor supply effects of these treatments differ significantly depending on individuals’ personal situation at the start of the experiment. While the provision of personalized information increases employment among individuals who have not yet worked the required number of hours, generic notifications reduce the labor supply of those who face a low personal risk of financial sanctions due to non-compliance with the requirement in the near future.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272300169X

Using a state boundary discontinuity design, I estimate the market spillovers of licensing on other occupations with similar skills, which I classify using hierarchical clustering techniques on skills data from O*NET. I find evidence of negative earnings and employment spillovers, with the largest earnings effects concentrated among women, black, and foreign-born Hispanic workers. These effects lead to greater earnings inequality. The results are most consistent with licensing changing skill- and industry-specific labor demand and with a monopsony model where licensing increases search costs and reduces workers’ outside options.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001299

We propose a mechanism combining some market-like properties with a modified second-price auction. The mechanism selects a host, a facility size, a compensation for hosting the project, and determines how the compensation is split among the non-hosts. If each community bids truthfully for becoming the host–a strategy from which no community has incentives to deviate–the selected allocation is globally optimal, even if communities’ preferences are private information. In contrast with the literature, the host pays the second-highest bid while receiving the market benefits to prevent distortions in the optimal size.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001354

We use the U.S. tax-transfer system as the benchmark policy and a sample of single mothers drawn from the CPS to assess reforms that maximize average expected utility among single mothers-to-be. When policy cannot be tagged by the age of the children, the optimal reform calls for an increase in out-of-work income support by about 15 percent, and a decrease in earnings subsidies to low-wage workers by roughly 50 percent. This reform delivers substantial welfare gains. Tagging policy by the age of the children makes the government’s trade-off between providing insurance to single mothers with children of pre-school age, on the one hand, and providing work incentives to those with school-age children, on the other hand, more favorable, thus increasing their scope for smoothing marginal utility throughout the life cycle. With tagging, mothers of pre-school age children get a substantial increase in out-of-work income support and no earnings subsidies.

This has been shown to improve distributional access in favor of reserved groups, but often conjectured (and shown in some cases) to come at the cost of governance quality. We develop a theoretical model to demonstrate that a political quota can, in contrast, improve governance if it weakens a village leader’s hold on power, making them more accountable to their supporters. The model establishes a tight set of predictions regarding when improvements should be expected to occur, and when not. We show, in a Maharashtrian (India) sample of rural villages, that governance outcomes dramatically improve under reservations for some, but not all, villages, and demonstrate a pattern of improvement that lines up with the predictions of the theory.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001457

Firms and savers may underreport income to avoid or evade taxation. We show that, even in the presence of underreporting, the equilibrium under tax competition may still be constrained-efficient (in the sense that there is no scope for welfare-enhancing tax coordination). This is the case if the marginal social costs of underreporting savings and investment income are equal. The model demonstrates that, if source-based taxes on capital are inefficiently low, as is often assumed, taxes on savings must be inefficiently high. Constrained-efficient tax policy minimizes the social cost of underreporting. The results are robust to introducing taxes on profit or labor income, if these types of income can be underreported as well. We conclude that commonly held assumptions on the need for coordination under tax competition need to be revised or qualified.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001470

As technology has enabled companies to provide services to consumers globally, a growing number of governments seek to tax service companies based on the customer location (“market-based sourcing”) rather than the location of the company’s labor and capital. Consistent with market-based sourcing reducing the tax cost of locating marginal labor in the state, I find that state adoption of market-based sourcing increases the total number of employees and total labor earnings in affected service industries by roughly 2 to 5 percent, after controlling for concurrent tax policy changes. I find indirect evidence that the effects are mostly attributable to business expansion rather than employee reallocation across states. Market-based sourcing does not seem to adversely affect state corporate tax revenues. This study provides timely insights for policymakers given increased adoption of market-based sourcing by U.S. states and related international proposals.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001482

Staggered implementation allows us to identify the causal effects of the reform. We find that computerization triggered a significant increase in reported imports in reformed ports compared to nonreformed ones, along with a sizeable increase in tax collection. Our results indicate that a combination of factors underpin the increase in declared imports: an actual increase in firms’ imports, a reduction in import underreporting and a redirection of imports from nonreformed to reformed ports that reveals importers' preference for the latter. Other signs of reduced corruption include increased predictability of clearance times and a reduction in the number of customs-related corruption cases prosecuted by the authorities. Importantly, increased imports lead to better firm performance: in municipalities associated with treated customs, sales of manufacturing firms increased by 5.2% for importers and shrunk by 3.9% for nonimporters. These effects increase over time and are concentrated in small- to medium-sized firms, which appear to have been the most affected by the nontariff barriers before computerization.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001512

Our main result shows that violent crime increases by 17 percent on a match day, with associated social costs of roughly 58 million euros annually. Exploring possible mechanisms, we find that the match day effect can be attributed to violence among males in the 18–39 age group, rises to 63 percent on days with high-rivalry derby matches, and that a non-negligible share of it stems from violent crimes committed by group offenders and assaults on police officers.

To overcome biases that can result from the endogeneity of federal aid allocations, we use an instrumental-variables estimator reliant on the substantial variation in federal aid predicted by variation in states’ congressional representation. We find that federal fiscal assistance dollars had a modest if any impact on the pace of vaccine rollouts, may have improved the equitability of vaccine administration, and had a substantial impact on the volume of tests administered. We observe that the difference in our findings for testing relative to vaccination suggests that surplus funds were more effective at increasing demand for services that exhibit relatively elastic demand, which is socially desirable when those services are associated with substantial public health externalities.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001548
Journal of Public Economics,2023,"Occupations, retirement, and the value of disability insurance",Lindsay Jacobs,"Occupations vary greatly in physical intensity, and there are, correspondingly, many differences in later-life work disability risk, retirement patterns, and applications for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)—a national program that insures shocks to work productivity due to disability, with about nine million current beneficiaries in the U.S. In light of its widespread coverage and large differences in utilization across occupations, this paper aims to measure the value of the SSDI program across a broad population and the extent to which it influences the major choice of occupation. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study and O*NET, I estimate a life-cycle equilibrium model of occupational choice, work, savings, and disability at older ages, and find that incorporating occupations and preference heterogeneity is an integral part of understanding work and SSDI application behavior. While SSDI coverage is nearly universal and the premiums from workers are uniform, estimates suggest that the value of the program varies greatly, from being worth 2.1 to 14.5 percent of earned income—depending on preferences and choice of occupation—though for all groups it is welfare improving. I also find that SSDI plays an important role in the choice of occupation for older workers, providing an insurance value that results in over ten percent more people choosing physically intense, blue-collar occupations at older ages. This overall effect, however, masks the underlying selection of less risk-averse individuals into blue-collar jobs, which, if not accounted for, would lead to overstating the effects of the SSDI program on behavior. A counterfactual experiment aimed at eliminating the distortion created by uniform SSDI tax rates shows that—even without any additional employer accommodation of disabled workers—occupation-specific tax rates lead to fewer aggregate work-disabled years.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001585

Cross-sectionally, regions with higher fragmentation have lower levels of dangerous opioid prescribing. This relationship is associational and may result from unobserved patient-level confounders.

This paper shows, when financially strapped, the timely and efficient allocation of rebates becomes essential. Using a unique panel of Chinese firms with export and rebates information, we show that delay in rebates has negative but unequal effects on firm exports. Delays in rebates also cause more exit and reduce the product scope. Furthermore, we find a “Matthew effect” in allocating rebates: exporters with tighter financial constraints respond more elastically to a delay in rebates, yet they are also more likely to have a higher delay ratio. Thus, reducing rebates delay to the most constrained firms is more effective than a similar reduction to the least constrained firms. In partial equilibrium, correcting the misallocation in rebates would increase Chinese exports by 35%, while eliminating rebates delay would increase exports by 52%.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001640

To do so, we exploit discontinuity generated by a 2010 policy in Iran limiting female hiring in the public sector, which greatly worsened employment opportunities for college-educated women. We find that the reform immediately reduced women’s college attendance by 11.4% points while it slightly increased men’s college attendance. We also find that it decreased women’s enrollment in college majors wherein employment probabilities are more reduced after the reform. In contrast, we do not observe any significant impact on other outcomes, including high school education decisions, labor supply patterns of high school graduates, and spillover effects into the private sector labor market. Lastly, we note that those who do not attend college are more likely to get married and/or have children at younger ages.

Journal of Public Economics,2023,Voter attention and electoral accountability,Saba Devdariani and Alexander V. Hirsch,"What sorts of policy decisions do voters pay attention to, and why? And how does rational voter attention affect the behavior of politicians in office? We extend the Canes-Wrone et al. (2001) model of electoral accountability to allow the voter to choose when to pay costly attention to learn the consequences of the incumbent’s policy. We find that the voter will pay the most attention in close races, when the instrumental value of information about incumbent performance is greatest. When the voter’s cost of attention is ‘intermediate,” she will pay different levels of attention to different policies, and generally pay more attention to an unpopular policy than a popular one. This asymmetric attention can improve accountability by giving a moderately strong incumbent an opportunity to be “caught in the act of being good” after choosing an unpopular policy. However, it can also harm accountability by leading a moderately strong incumbent to categorically avoid the unpopular policy to evade voter scrutiny. This negative effect can be sufficiently strong to harm the voter’s overall welfare, providing a novel rationale for why subsidizing information about government performance may unintentionally harm voters. Finally, we find that rational voter attention can never induce “fake leadership,” i.e., a moderately weak incumbent choosing an unpopular policy precisely because it draws more scrutiny, hoping that the voter discovers an accidental policy success.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001007

The nonfinancial incentive also reduced between–hamlet differences in public resources allocated by presidents within their village, and it was significantly less costly to implement compared to the financial incentive.

We show how such data can be used to recover students’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for college-related activities in the absence of COVID-19, without parametric assumptions on the underlying heterogeneity in WTP. We find that the average WTP for in-person instruction (relative to a remote format) represents around 6.5% of the average annual net cost of attending university, while the average WTP for on-campus social activities is 10.2% of the average annual net costs. Lower-income and first-generation derive substantially lower value from university social life, partly due to time and resource constraints.

We further find that the effect of JSM on DI materializes before any sanction can be imposed and monitored individuals are still 10 percentage points more likely to be on DI three years after the start of monitoring. Ultimately, exploring fiscal implications reveals that the decrease in unemployment transfers as a result of JSM is entirely offset by the increase in DI transfers.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001111
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Trade-offs between access and quality in healthcare: Evidence from retail clinics in Mexico,Adrian Rubli,"In settings with inefficient public provision, expansions in low-cost private-market healthcare delivery may be welfare-improving by increasing access, but may be sacrificing on quality. I study the introduction of retail clinics at private pharmacies in Mexico. I find that entry led to large declines in public-sector emergency room visits and a small but significant reduction in public clinic visits for relatively mild respiratory infections. I also find a significant increase in public clinic visits for chronic conditions and a slight decline in emergency room visits, consistent with better disease management. However, I estimate a sizable association between retail clinics and a shift toward stronger antibiotics in private-market sales. Hence, although retail clinics improve access to healthcare, they may be overselling their patients.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001202

Here, we analyze how controlling profit shifting influences fiscal competition. Equilibrium tax rates are determined by the elasticities of two components: retained profit and capital mobility. Anti-profit-shifting policies decrease the elasticity of the first, but increase the elasticity of the second. The impact of these policies on equilibrium tax rates is then ambiguous. We show that there are cases in which laxer policies increase equilibrium tax rates and countries’ well-being by favoring investments. We use estimates of different elasticities to show that our model can support lax enforcement.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001226

Miller,"The distribution of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums in the United States is difficult to fully characterize with survey data. Using administrative tax data, we plot the population distribution of premiums and provide new evidence about the relationship between premiums and demographic characteristics, including income. The distribution of premiums measured in the tax data is comparable to survey data. People with higher incomes are more likely to have an employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) policy and, conditional on having a policy, select more expensive plans. Because higher income policyholders and their employers spend more on ESI, they also receive a disproportionate amount of government subsidies for health insurance, even when we account for non-ESI subsidies through Medicare, Medicaid, and Premium Tax Credits. Even though the distribution of health subsidies is skewed toward those with higher incomes, it is less than a quarter as unequal as the distribution of income itself.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272300124X
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Estimating labor supply responses to Danish tax reforms,Hans Schytte Sigaard,"This paper estimates the elasticity of labor supply at the intensive margin by applying the latest estimation strategies from the elasticity of taxable income literature to administrative register data on performed hours of work. Performed hours of work are contract hours plus paid overtime, minus paid absence, vacation, and holiday leave. I estimate elasticities of labor supply at the intensive margin (ELS), labor income (ELI), and taxable income (ETI) of 0.08, 0.06, and 0.1. The results show that the high ratio of ELI to ETI can be attributed to changes in labor supply for wage earners, capturing inherent labor responses. As a result, I explicitly connect the labor supply and ETI literatures. The labor supply response is driven by changes in contract hours, paid absence, and individuals switching between main and secondary employment. These results suggest that contextual factors such as labor market fluidity and flexibility are important to facilitate real responses to taxation and that labor supply responses are core underlying drivers of total responses to taxation.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001251
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Barriers to charitable giving,"Marco Castillo, Ragan Petrie and Clarence Wardell","Donating to charity requires time, effort and attention. If the costs to give are perceived to be large, charities may lose out on donations. We develop a nonparametric test for the presence of these general nuisance costs and conduct a large-scale field experiment to show that costs to give are sizable and impactful. Potential donors were offered a 5:1 fixed match if their donation met or exceeded a minimum amount (e.g. $1, $5 or $10). Absent nuisance costs, the probability of donating should decrease as the minimum amount increases. We find the opposite. We estimate that about half of donors in our sample have nuisance costs of $7 or more. Eliminating these costs would double donations. Charities seeking to expand donations from small donors thus face challenges. Offering a fixed match for donations above a certain threshold may be more effective, by essentially covering nuisance costs, than the standard practice of subsidizing all donations with dollar-for-dollar matches.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001275
Journal of Public Economics,2023,On the existence of private unemployment insurance with advance information on future job losses,Piotr Denderski and Christian A. Stoltenberg,"We study the existence of a profitable unemployment insurance market in a dynamic economy with adverse selection rooted in workers’ advance information on future job losses. The new feature of the model is that the insurer and workers interact repeatedly. Repeated interactions make it possible to threaten workers with exclusion from future insurance benefits after a default on insurance premia. With exclusion, the insurer can offer not only insurance against unemployment risk itself but also against bad news about a future job loss. We discipline our model with estimates of the willingness to pay for unemployment insurance and the costs of adverse selection in the US. Our quantitative results illustrate that private unemployment insurance could be profitable for an exclusion length of one year. To stimulate the emergence of a private unemployment insurance market, policymakers can facilitate the creation of a registry that archives past defaults on insurance premia.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723001287

Journal of Public Economics,2023,Choice and consequence: Assessing mismatch at Chicago exam schools,"Joshua Angrist, Parag Pathak and Roman A. Zarate","The educational mismatch hypothesis asserts that students are hurt by affirmative action policies placing them in selective schools for which they wouldn’t otherwise qualify. We evaluate mismatch in Chicago’s selective public exam schools, which admit students using neighborhood-based diversity criteria as well as test scores. Regression discontinuity estimates for applicants favored by affirmative action indeed show no gains in reading and negative effects of exam school attendance on math scores and four-year college enrollment. But these results are similar for more- and less-selective schools and for applicants more and less likely to benefit from affirmative action, a pattern inconsistent with mismatch. We show that Chicago exam school effects are determined largely by the schools attended when not offered an exam school seat. In particular, apparent mismatch is explained by the fact that exam school admission diverts many applicants from high-performing Noble Network charter schools, where they would have done well. Consistent with these findings, exam schools reduce math scores for applicants applying from high-quality charter schools in another large urban district. Exam school applicants’ previous achievement, race, and other demographic characteristics that are sometimes said to mediate student-school matching play no role in this story.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000749
Journal of Public Economics,2023,The effects of changes in social security’s delayed retirement credit: Evidence from administrative data,"Mark Duggan, Irena Dushi, Sookyo Jeong and Gina Li","The delayed retirement credit (DRC) increases monthly OASI (Old Age and Survivors Insurance) retired worker benefits for primary beneficiaries who claim after their full retirement age (FRA). For many years, the DRC was set at 3.0 percent per year (0.25 percent monthly). The 1983 amendments to Social Security more than doubled this actuarial adjustment to 8.0 percent per year, with the changes phased in gradually over time. In this paper, we use administrative data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to estimate the effect of this policy change on individual claiming behavior and labor supply. We focus on the first half of the DRC increase (from 3.0 to 5.5 percent) given changes in other SSA policies that coincided with the later increases. Our findings demonstrate that the increase in the DRC led to an increase in delayed claiming of Social Security benefits among men and strongly suggest that the effects were larger for those with higher lifetime incomes, who would have a greater financial incentive to delay given their longer life expectancies. Furthermore, liquidity constraints play an important role in responsiveness to DRC increases. We do not find evidence of changes to the claiming behavior of women or to labor supply for either men or women.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000816

To answer this fundamental question, we combine a field experiment that randomly provides access to a bank account with weekly interviews on household finances. Access to banking does not change average consumption, but it improves consumption smoothing by alleviating savings constraints. Indeed, the control’s expenditures follow income more closely than the expenditures of the treated. The latter handle variations in income by engaging in pro-cyclical saving in their account.

In this paper I contribute evidence on this question by re-examining a British compulsory schooling reform that yields large-scale and quasi-experimental variation in schooling. First, I note that this reform was introduced in 1947, when British students attended higher-track (for the “top” 20%) or lower-track (for the rest) secondary schools. The reform increased the minimum school leaving age from 14 to 15 and I show that the vast majority (over 95%) of affected students attended lower-track schools. Second, I show that the additional schooling induced by the reform had close to zero impact on a range of labor market outcomes. Third, I attribute these findings to the quality of these lower-track schools, which I argue was low along several dimensions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000841
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Diseconomies of scale and subsidies in urban public transportation,Nicolas Coulombel and Guillaume Monchambert,"Subsidization of urban public transportation systems is often motivated by economies of scale and second-best considerations such as an underpriced road alternative. We model a public transit line subject to frictions between users (in-vehicle crowding), users and vehicles (boarding and alighting delays), and vehicles (congestion). We derive the profit- and welfare-maximizing provisions of supply. We show that if demand exceeds a first threshold, the system enters a congested regime and service frequency decreases. Beyond a second threshold, the strong deterioration of service quality causes the transit line to operate under diseconomies of scale, calling for a Pigouvian tax instead of a subsidy. This finding, which goes against Mohring’s classical rule (1972), holds with an untolled road alternative, provided that the network structure remains constant. We estimate the model for the London Piccadilly line and find evidence of substantial diseconomies of scale during the morning peak, adding up to −1.49 £/trip for the observed provision of service quality (-0.61 £/trip at optimum). These results question current subsidy policies for the busiest transit lines.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000853

Journal of Public Economics,2023,Timing matters: Intra-day shifts of economic activity and ambient ozone concentrations,David Adler and Edson Severnini,"Ground-level ozone has been shown to have significant negative health externalities from short-term exposure, and as such has been regulated by the U.S. Clean Air Act since the 1970s. Ozone is not emitted directly; instead formation occurs due to a complex Leontief-like combination of air pollutants, under sunlight and warm temperatures, that results in high levels mid-day and low levels at night. Despite this known relationship, EPA regulations mostly consider the total emissions of ozone precursors and not when these emissions occur. Using hourly data on ambient ozone from 1980 to 2017 near the U.S. time zone borders, we provide evidence that the 1-hour time difference on either side of a border leads to a nontrivial change in ozone levels in certain hours of the day. We then examine a cap-and-trade program targeting ozone precursor emissions – the NOx Budget Program – finding that while it reduced ozone overall it did not have an economically significant effect on the timing of those emissions. We conclude by outlining a possible policy approach to account for the time-varying value of reductions in ozone precursor emissions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000877

The effect of lowering the full retirement age on retirement decisions",Mathias Dolls and Carla Krolage,"This paper analyzes behavioral responses to a 2014 reform in the German public pension system that lowered the full retirement age (FRA) of individuals with a long contribution history by up to two years and framed the new FRA as reference age for retirement. Using administrative data from public pension insurance accounts, we first document a substantial bunching response at the FRA exceeding the control group’s bunching by 83%. Second, we show in a difference-in-difference setting that a 1.0 year decrease in the FRA leads to a reduction in the average pension claiming age by 0.3–0.4 years. Treated individuals neither have poorer health nor are more likely to be liquidity-constrained than individuals in the control group. Our results suggest that the strong responses to the reform are driven both by the new FRA serving as a reference point and by financial incentives.

Incorporating this offsetting behavior, we estimate net savings increase by 37 percent on average in the short run. Spouses do not alter their saving behavior. Over a longer time-horizon, the net savings effect for employees still employed by the same firm declines for high-wage employees and increases for low-wage employees.

Using a unique data set of 11,238 commercial lawsuits involving Chinese listed firms, we examine how China's recent anti-corruption campaign, one of whose goals is to combat political interference in the courts, affects court advantages of politically connected firms. We find that connected firms' win rates dropped by 6.3% after the anti-corruption, suggesting that the campaign stopped corrupt politicians transferring 1.8% of total monetary amounts of commercial disputes from unconnected to politically connected parties by influencing trials. The effect is more salient for firms connected to more powerful officials, noncontract-based cases, lower-level courts, regions with weak legal environments, and courts that depend more on local government. Moreover, anti-corruption promotes a better judicial environment, not only improves the quality of judicial decisions, but also boosts public confidence in the judicial system, and encourages firms to settle conflicts through court. Finally, we explore the campaign's broader economic influences and find that after the campaign, cities with initially poorly functioning judiciaries gained more investment, employed more labor, produced more output, and attracted more new firms, particularly in those industries with high contract intensity. Overall, the anti-corruption campaign significantly improved the judicial and economic environment in China.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000439
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Identity breeds inequality: Evidence from a laboratory experiment on redistribution,"Urs Fischbacher, David Grammling, Jan Hausfeld and Vojtěch Zíka","Politics is increasingly driven by identity cleavages, which also affect the discussion about inequality and redistribution. Typically, redistribution is meant to reduce inequality, implying that redistribution neither makes the rich richer nor the former poor the new rich. However, if identity affects redistribution, these limits might no longer be binding, and redistribution could further increase existing inequalities (making the rich richer) or reverse the income ordering to favor the once-poor (which can even be inequality increasing if redistribution is strong). In a laboratory experiment, we investigate redistribution via a novel smooth one-dimensional distribution mechanism that also allows for an increase or reversal of inequality. Decision-makers receive information about the recipients' political orientation, nationality, or seat number during the experiment, and we vary the structure and source of income inequality (income is either earned, random, or unfair). We find most choices of the decision-makers involve redistribution, with only 8 % of choices sticking with the status quo. While most redistribution choices reduce inequality, a larger share—(18 %)—increase inequality by making the rich richer, 13 % of choices reduce overall inequality but make the poor the new rich, and 9 % increase inequality by making the poor very rich. Thus, 40 % of decisions are redistributions that are typically unobserved in common redistribution designs. Ingroup favoritism is a strong motive for redistribution in general, and it is the most important motive for redistribution to increase or reverse inequality. Indeed, 85 % of the inequality-increasing or reversing decisions favor the ingroup. Complementary eye-tracking data show that decision-makers’ attention to information about the recipients’ groups and to poor outliers are related to higher levels of redistribution.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000488

County officials faced severe negative career consequences if they failed to fulfill these targets. We found that county-level education expenditures increased progressively as the pre-specified inspection period drew near but decreased dramatically after the inspection. This phenomenon was interpreted as evidence of the window-dressing behavior of county governments. Further analysis suggests that local officials with longer tenure and who were thus closer to promotion evaluations tended to engage in more aggressively window-dressing.

First, we identify limitations of the frequently used specification test that distinguishes between the standard models of pure and impure altruism based on the extent of crowding out. While the literature takes as given the result that crowding out should be less with impure altruism than with pure altruism, we show that it can be either more or less. Second, we propose a new, more general test based on the presence of crowding in or greater than one-for-one crowding out, both of which are consistent with impure altruism only. Third, we provide empirical evidence. Using a unique panel data set on volunteerism in U.S. National Parks, we estimate the causal effect of changes in a park’s public funding on the amount of within-park volunteerism. The overall finding is that each additional dollar of public expenditure crowds in 27 cents worth of volunteerism on average.

Journal of Public Economics,2023,Food subsidies in general equilibrium,Albert Jan Hummel and Vinzenz Ziesemer,"The Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem on uniform consumption taxation breaks down if prices are endogenous. This paper investigates the implications for optimal food subsidies in China. To do so, we build a general equilibrium model where low-skilled workers have a comparative advantage in the production of food. Food subsidies raise the relative demand for low-skilled workers, which reduces the skill premium and indirectly redistributes income from high-skilled to low-skilled workers. The optimal food subsidy balances these distributional gains against the costs of distorting consumption decisions. We calibrate our model to match key moments from the Chinese economy, including sectoral production and spending patterns that we obtain from micro-level survey data.

Using an event study, we estimate that workers with week-long Covid-19 absences are 7 percentage points less likely to be in the labor force one year later compared to otherwise-similar workers who do not miss a week of work for health reasons. Our estimates suggest Covid-19 absences have reduced the U.S.labor force by approximately 500,000 people (0.2 percent of adults) and imply an average labor supply loss per Covid-19 absence equivalent to $9,000 in forgone earnings, about 90 percent of which reflects losses beyond the initial absence week.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000713
Journal of Public Economics,2023,The salary taboo privacy norms and the diffusion of information,Zoë Cullen and Ricardo Perez-Truglia,"The diffusion of salary information has implications for labor markets, such as wage discrimination policies and collective bargaining. Access to salary information is believed to be limited and unequal, but there is little direct evidence on the sources of these information frictions. Social scientists have long conjectured that privacy norms around salary (i.e., the “salary taboo”) play an important role. We provide unique evidence of this phenomenon based on a field experiment with 755 employees at a large commercial bank in Southeast Asia. We show that many of its employees are both unwilling to reveal their salaries to coworkers and reluctant to ask coworkers about their salaries. These frictions persist, in smaller magnitude, when sharing less sensitive information on seniority. We discuss implications for pay transparency policies and the gender wage gap.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000725

In two waves of a natural field experiment in the market for computer repairs we study whether consumers benefit from accessing online information about their needs or previous consumers’ experience with particular sellers. We find that gaining noisy knowledge about one’s needs and revealing it to the seller is a costly mistake, since seemingly better informed customers pay, on average, higher prices. By contrast, accessing online ratings helps identifying sellers who provide appropriate quality at reasonable prices, in particular on rating platforms that filter out untrustworthy reviews.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000737
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Suing the government under weak rule of law: Evidence from administrative litigation reform in China,"Guangyu Cao, Chenran Liu and Li-An Zhou","There is a long-standing debate in the literature about the effectiveness of strengthening judicial independence in developing countries with weak rule of law. This paper exploits a recent Chinese judicial reform in administrative litigation, which changed the jurisdiction rule from intra-regional to trans-regional, to estimate the effects of improved judicial independence on protecting private entities against potential abuses of public authority. We find a significant increase in the probability of successfully suing local governments after the reform, especially when the defendants are more powerful government departments and when the plaintiffs are individual citizens with fewer legal resources than firms. But this effect is more limited for higher-level governments. The reform also results in increased case filings, prolonged trial time, and enhanced judicial quality. In addition, it raises the awareness of both governments and citizens about the rule of law, increases firm entry, and worsens general public attitudes toward local governments, at least in the short term. Our study highlights trans-regional jurisdiction as a new source of judicial independence in a party state and its potential limitations.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000774
Journal of Public Economics,2023,The inequality impact of consumption taxes: An international comparison,"Julien Blasco, Elvire Guillaud and Michaël Zemmour","Consumption taxes are often considered as the most regressive component of the tax system. However, there are only few estimates, and even fewer international comparisons, of the redistributive impact of consumption taxes in the literature, due to scarce data on household expenditures. We use household budget and income surveys and microsimulation to provide consistent estimates of the regressivity of consumption taxes for a large panel of countries and years. We propose a new method for imputing household consumption expenditure across countries: this can be applied to any dataset that contains income information and potentially other socio-demographic variables. We stress that using housing rents, when available, to impute household consumption and calculate consumption taxes significantly improves the accuracy of the model. We have three results. First, in almost all countries, consumption taxes fall disproportionately on low-income households: the top income decile pays a share of its income in consumption taxes that is only 60 percent of what the bottom half pays. Second, income inequality is higher when calculated after consumption taxes, and this rise in inequality offsets one-third of the redistributive effect of tax-benefit systems. Last, cross-country differences in the inequality effect of consumption taxes are mainly explained by different implicit tax rates (from 7 to 30 percent in our sample), rather than variations in the distribution of household consumption patterns. Consumption taxes should therefore be taken into account when comparing income inequality and tax-benefit systems across countries, as the most-redistributive systems generally come with high consumption taxes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000798
Journal of Public Economics,2023,A preference-based theory unifying monetary and non-monetary poverty measurement,Benoit Decerf,"Multidimensional poverty measures are increasingly used in practice even though they face criticism and generate long-lasting debates. These contentions primarily find their origin in the divergence between standard poverty identification practices and a preference-based definition of the poor. This paper fills this gap by proposing a poverty measurement theory that (i) adopts a preference-based definition of the poor, (ii) acknowledges that the relevant preference is only partially known and (iii) encompasses both market and non-market dimensions of well-being. A preference-based definition satisfying two mild substitutability assumptions implies that two types of individuals are poor: individuals who experience an extremely low outcome in at least one dimension (“extremors”) and individuals who cumulate moderately low outcomes in several dimensions (“cumulators”). The paper shows that standard identification practices are not flexible enough to properly identify both types of poor individuals and proposes a simple refinement that improves on this issue. The theory provides a conceptual foundation from which practitioners may derive guidance for the many choices they face.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000804

We examine the 1999 pension reform in Germany, which increased the ERA for women born after 1951 by at least three years. First, we present suggestive evidence that women update their retirement planning in response to the reform. Using the German Income and Consumption Survey, we find a negative impact on private savings of 0.6 percentage points that is driven by households with married women. We show that households consisting of highly educated women and homeowners are more likely to reduce their savings rates. Furthermore, we find that the treated households increase their leisure spending while maintaining an unchanged level of disposable income. Our findings suggest that the households anticipate experiencing a lifetime income increase and reduce their savings rate to smooth consumption.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000270

Part D led to larger increases in advertising in geographic areas with higher concentrations of Medicare beneficiaries. We examine the impact of this differential increase in advertising on non-elderly individuals to isolate advertising effects from the direct effects of Part D. We find that exposure to advertising led to large increases in treatment initiation and improved medication adherence. Advertising also had sizeable positive spillover effects on non-advertised generic drugs. Our results imply significant spillovers from Medicare Part D on the under-65 population and an important role for non-price factors in influencing prescription drug utilization.,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000427

Using data on card transactions in Seoul, we find that households do not consider stimulus payments fungible. Compared to Seoul residents’ benchmark spending responses to cash income gains by sector, the stimulus payments disproportionately increased Seoul residents’ spending in the allowed sector compared to the non-allowed sector. The payments did not increase non-Seoul residents’ card spending.

Journal of Public Economics,2023,Optimal income taxation in unionized labor markets,Albert Jan Hummel and Bas Jacobs,"This paper extends the Diamond (1980) model with labor unions to study optimal income taxation and to analyze whether unions can be desirable for income redistribution if income taxes are optimized. Unions bargain with firms over wages in each sector and firms unilaterally determine employment. Optimal unemployment benefits and optimal income taxes are lower in unionized labor markets. Unions raise the efficiency costs of income redistribution, because unemployment benefits and income taxes raise wage demands, and thereby generate involuntary unemployment. We show that unions are socially desirable only if they represent (low-income) workers whose participation is subsidized on a net basis. By creating implicit taxes on work, unions alleviate the labor-market distortions caused by income taxation. We empirically verify whether (i) participation tax rates are lower if unions are more powerful, and (ii) unions are desirable by compiling our own data set with union densities and participation tax rates for 18 sectors in 23 advanced countries. In line with our theoretical predictions, we find that participation tax rates are lower if unions are stronger. Moreover, the desirability condition for unions is never met empirically. Numerical simulations for the Netherlands confirm that unions are not desirable if income taxes are optimized and optimal participation taxes are lower if unions are stronger.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722002031
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Partisan political beliefs and social learning,"Andrea Robbett, Lily Colón and Peter Matthews","American politics is currently characterized by polarized beliefs about otherwise verifiable realities, a pathology often ascribed to the influence of “echo chambers” on like-minded partisans. Partisans may seek out the views of like-minded individuals for either instrumental reasons, that is, because co-partisans are presumed to know more, or for expressive reasons, to learn or confirm “partisan congenial” beliefs. We conduct an online experiment to characterize the demand for, and use of, social information about political beliefs. We find that participants are responsive to the cues of both co-partisans and mixed partisan groups, but are less disposed to consult opposing partisans or to follow their beliefs. However, when a reliable source of outside information becomes available, participants are much less likely to seek social information of any kind, consistent with an instrumental rather than expressive motive. In short, there is mistrust across partisan lines but also a willingness to consult social information in pursuit of “correct beliefs.” The further observation that those who do consult peers are not correct more often underscores the importance of reliable private information as a bulwark against some of the pernicious effects of echo chambers.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000166

Based on the individual tax files of the universe of VAT payers in Germany, our analysis shows that harnessing incentives for consumers through tax credits fosters firms’ compliance with VAT by bringing in an element of third-party reporting at the last VAT stage. Our results point at strong stimulating effects of the introduction of the tax credit on reported sales as well as on the ratio of reported sales to inputs and we find limited price effects. While two thirds of the revenue losses in the income tax are recovered by an increase in VAT revenues, at least a quarter and up to a half of the revenue gain is associated with a response at the VAT evasion margin.

Experimental evidence from a public health insurance scheme in India,Pascaline Dupas and Radhika Jain,"We study the role of hospital compliance in the effectiveness of government health insurance in India. Using patient surveys, we document that participating hospitals charge unauthorized fees to poor patients eligible to receive free care. Average out-of-pocket payments (OOPP) for chronic kidney care patients are $43 per month, or 25% annual GDP per capita, and are high at both public and private hospitals. Awareness of program benefits is low despite patients having used insurance for several months. We conduct a randomized experiment to test whether phone-based information about program benefits can enable insurance beneficiaries to hold hospitals accountable and lower OOPP. The intervention effectively increases program awareness by 0.17 standard deviations but has no effect on OOPP overall. However, effects differ dramatically by hospital sector: patients at private hospital see no change in OOPP despite increased bargaining and search; monthly OOPP among patients visiting public hospitals, who are poorer and lower caste, drop by $12 (35%), because they are able to negotiate to get more of their benefits at the hospital instead of paying for them off-site. The findings suggest that patient-driven accountability can meaningfully improve public service delivery, even in the context of specialized tertiary care, but may not substitute for top-down monitoring of private agents.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000233

Santos,"Whether consumption or labor income is progressively taxed is irrelevant to household choices and welfare in a static setting. Add dynamics to the problem and these two forms of progressivity have markedly different implications for how earnings vary along the life cycle: in a stylized life-cycle model, the progressive income tax reduces Frisch elasticities of labor supply whereas the progressive consumption tax reduces the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution. We explore the consequences of replacing the current U.S. tax system with one in which labor income taxes are linear and consumption taxes are progressive. We find welfare gains that exceed 10% in consumption equivalent variation terms in steady-state comparisons. An indirect consequence of the more variable earnings profile, greater asset accumulation, is found to be a very if not the most important quantitative aspect of progressive consumption taxes. Also important, when compared to labor income taxes, progressive consumption taxes are more positively correlated with inherited wealth. We take this aspect into account by considering a non–homothetic warm-glow motive that approximates the empirical distribution of wealth. We discuss several issues related to implementation and find that approximately half of the welfare gains are attained by using the information gathered by social security to implement income averaging in the sense of Vickrey (1947).",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000361
Journal of Public Economics,2023,The unintended effects of minimum wage increases on crime,"Zachary Fone, Joseph J. Sabia and Resul Cesur","The availability of higher-paying jobs for low-skilled individuals has been documented to reduce crime. This study explores the impact of one of the most prominent labor policies designed to provide higher wages for low-skilled workers — the minimum wage — on teenage and young adult arrests. Using data from the 1998–2016 Uniform Crime Reports and a difference-in-differences approach, we find that a 1 percent increase in the minimum wage is associated with a 0.2 to 0.3 percent increase in property crime arrests among 16-to-24-year-olds, an effect driven by an increase in larceny-related arrests. The magnitudes of our estimated elasticities suggest that a $15 Federal minimum wage, proposed as part of the Raise the Wage Act, could generate approximately 309,000 additional larcenies. Job loss emerges as an important mechanism to explain our findings, and supplemental analyses of affected workers in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 show that this effect is concentrated among workers bound by minimum wage increases. Finally, we find no evidence that minimum wage hikes impact violent crime arrests.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001827

In our model, energy producers emit carbon, which creates a negative environmental externality, and may decide to switch to cleaner technology. A benevolent social planner sets carbon taxes without commitment. Higher future carbon taxes both reduce emissions given technology and encourage energy producers to switch to cleaner technology. Geoengineering advances, which reduce the negative environmental effects of the existing stock of carbon, decrease future carbon taxes and thus discourage private investments in conventional clean technology. We characterize the conditions under which these advances diminish—rather than improve—environmental quality and welfare, and show that given current estimates of costs and environmental damages, these conditions are likely to be satisfied in our model.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722002043

Using COVID-19 as a shock to online shopping and hand-collected high-frequency data on local sales tax revenue, we document an important shift in the state and local public finance landscape. As e-commerce increases, a destination basis for remote sales taxes results in higher growth in local sales tax collections in smaller, generally more rural jurisdictions. This increase comes at the expense of larger urban retail centers, which previously enjoyed an origin basis for sales tax collections. As households replace in-person commerce with online shopping, sales taxes no longer accrue to urban centers with large concentrations of retail establishments and instead expand the tax base of smaller jurisdictions. State-level reforms that enforce sales tax compliance generally mitigate the revenue falls in larger jurisdictions and amplify the increases in smaller jurisdictions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722002201

We analyze voter behavior following one such policy implemented in the world’s largest democracy – India’s 2016 ‘Demonetization,’ which unexpectedly made 86% of the currency-in-circulation redundant overnight, and led to severe cash shortages and economic hardship in subsequent months. Yet, the policy appealed to a majority of voters, and was framed as one that would combat corruption. We leverage a discontinuity in the number of bank branches arising from a nationwide, district-level bank expansion policy. Using the fact that districts with fewer banks had greater cash shortages, we identify the impacts of demonetization’s economic severity at the bank-expansion cutoff. Regression discontinuity estimates show that following demonetization, voters in places with more severe demonetization had less favorable views of the policy. Using a difference-in-discontinuity design, we find that the ruling party performed relatively worse in regions with more severe demonetization, receiving a 4.7 percentage point lower fraction of votes, and were relatively less likely to win seats in state legislatures. Areas that were historically strongly aligned with the ruling party were nearly unresponsive in voting behavior, despite having a less favorable view of the policy itself.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000014

We study air pollution shock mitigation in a high-stakes healthcare setting: hospital surgery scheduling. Using newly available inpatient surgery records from a major city in China, we track post-surgery survival for over 1 million patients, and document a significant increase of hospital mortality among those who underwent surgeries on days with high particulate matter pollution. This effect has two important features. First, pollution on the surgery day, rather than exposure prior to hospitalization, before or after the surgery, primarily explains the excess mortality. Second, a small but high-risk group – elderly patients undergoing respiratory or cancer operations – bears a majority of pollution’s damages. Based on these empirical findings, we analyze a model of hospital surgery scheduling. For over a third of the high-risk surgeries, there exists an alternative, lower-pollution day within three days such that moving the surgery may lead to a Pareto improvement in survival.11We are extremely grateful for Professor Ling Li at National School of Development, Peking University for generous help with data access.

Journal of Public Economics,2023,Does weak enforcement deter tax progressivity?,Enrico Rubolino,"In contexts with weak enforcement, the threat of tax evasion may constrain policy makers’ power to set tax policies optimally. This paper studies whether stricter tax enforcement affects the tax schedule set by local governments. I take advantage of an Italian policy that generated cross-municipality variation in the scope for tackling income and property tax evasion through stricter tax enforcement. Combining an event-study design with municipality-level panel data on statutory tax rates, I show that stricter tax enforcement tips the balance in favor of higher marginal tax rates for middle and top incomes, while the poor benefit of a lower marginal tax rate. The tax hike is larger in places with higher pre-program inequality and where intrinsic tax compliance attitudes are weaker. As a result of higher tax revenue, municipalities hire more workers and raise public spending. These results suggest that tax enforcement policies have not only the power to foster tax capacity, but also to enhance the ability to pursue redistributive policies.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723000154

Its appeal in part lies in its robustness to tax evasion relative to other tax instruments. Exploiting a tax reform from Pakistan that cuts the tax rate on five major industries of the country substantially, I estimate the size and nature of VAT evasion in the treated industries, finding that it ranges from 31–46% of the potential revenue. One important channel through which the evasion occurs is the overclaim of refunds, which constitute 11–23% of the potential revenue. Roughly two-fifths of the overclaimed refund is based on spurious invoices issued by invoice mills. Qualitatively, noncompliance is stronger in the latter stages of the supply chain, but it runs deep inside the chain, suggesting that on their own the self-enforcement mechanisms built into a VAT do not deter tax evasion fully.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001852

In Punjab, Pakistan, we document that political interference routinely protects doctors from bureaucratic sanction, while personal connections between doctors and politicians and a lack of political competition are associated with more doctor absence. We then examine how politics impacts the success of an at-scale policy reform to combat absenteeism. We find that the reform was more effective at increasing doctor attendance in politically competitive constituencies, both through increased monitoring and through senior health officials being able to respond more effectively to the data gathered on poor performing clinics. Our results demonstrate that politics can block the success of reform; instead of lifting poor performers up, the reform only improved places that had already been performing better.

We use a regression discontinuity design that exploits the fact that in some faculties, enrollment in the fourth (honors) year is governed by a grade-based eligibility rule. Students with average grades in their third year just above the threshold are significantly more likely to complete the fourth year and have higher earnings after graduation relative to students who narrowly missed the grade cutoff. The implied earnings return to the additional year of college is about 12 % six months after graduation.

Metcalf,"We analyze the labor market and aggregate effects of a carbon tax in a framework with pollution externalities and equilibrium unemployment. Our model incorporates labor force participation and two margins of adjustment influenced by carbon taxes: (1) firm creation and (2) green production-technology adoption. A carbon-tax policy that reduces carbon emissions by 35 percent—broadly consistent with Biden Administration’s new Paris Agreement commitment—can generate mild positive long-run effects on consumption and output, an expansion in the number and fraction of firms that use green technologies, and greater labor force participation, with marginal changes in the unemployment rate. In the short term, the adjustment to a higher carbon tax need not be accompanied by losses in output and consumption or a substantial increase in unemployment. Abstracting from green technology adoption implies that the same policy has substantial adverse short- and long-term effects on labor income, consumption, and output.

We show that both forces partly offset each other. In general equilibrium, migration may lower the bottom tax rate but raises the top tax rate, challenging the classical migration-threat argument. Moreover, we demonstrate that migration responses weaken the trickle-down rationale. Both findings can be explained by a novel wage effect on migration and a migration effect on wages, calling for higher top tax rates to amplify pre-tax wage inequality and prevent high-skilled emigration.

Incorporating perceived best practices from previous initiatives, the CCTC combines explicit eligibility thresholds with some discretion on the part of program officials to select tax credit recipients. The structure and implementation of the program facilitates rigorous evaluation.

Local multipliers are larger for non-manufacturing awards than for manufacturing awards. CCTC awards increase employment among workers across socioeconomic groups and in more- as well as less-advantaged neighborhoods, but have limited impact on residents of affected communities.

At the top, households evade around 8% of their true tax liability. The “merely rich” (P90-P99.9) own 67% of hidden wealth, while the “super rich” account for only 7%. Consequently, the correction for offshore wealth has a modest effect on top wealth shares. We describe a number of explanations for the distribution of tax evasion by Dutch households: low-cost tax evasion opportunities in neighbouring countries for the “merely rich”, sophisticated forms of tax evasion for, low effective tax rates on and migration to low tax jurisdictions by the “super rich”. Taken together, these explanations suggest that the distribution of tax evasion strongly depends on a country’s geographical and institutional settings.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001876
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Do environmental markets cause environmental injustice? Evidence from California’s carbon market,Danae Hernandez-Cortes and Kyle C. Meng,"Market-based environmental policies are widely adopted on the basis of allocative efficiency. However, there is growing concern that market-induced spatial reallocation of pollution could widen existing pollution concentration gaps between disadvantaged and other communities. We examine how this “environmental justice” (EJ) gap changed following the 2013 introduction of California’s carbon market, the world’s second largest and the most subjected to EJ critiques. We estimate that the program lowered GHG, PM2.5, PM10, and NOx emissions by 3–9% annually between 2012–2017 for sample industrial facilities regulated only by the carbon market. Using a pollution dispersal model to characterize resulting spatial changes in pollution concentrations, we find the program caused EJ gaps in PM2.5, PM10, and NOx from these facilities to narrow by 6–10% annually. We demonstrate that explicit modeling of pollution dispersal is critical for detecting these results.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001888
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Judicial subversion: The effects of political power on court outcomes,Guilherme Lambais and Henrik Sigstad,"Are politicians in power treated more leniently in court? We show that Brazilian mayoral candidates charged with misconduct are 65 percent less likely to be convicted if they narrowly win the election. Politicians play no direct role in the judges’ careers, suggesting that formal independence does not completely insulate the judiciary from political influence. The effect is driven by districts with few judges and by judges with higher career instability.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001906
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Ordinal rank and the structure of ability peer effects,Marco Bertoni and Roberto Nisticò,"Exposure to high-ability peers entails positive learning externalities, but it also decreases students’ academic self-concept because of lower ordinal ability rank. We show that, as a result, the linear-in-means parameter identifies a composite (i.e., reduced form) effect. We illustrate the empirical relevance of this issue using data from two experiments that randomly assign students to groups. We find that the structural effect of mean peer ability estimated by a model that includes rank is much larger than the reduced form effect obtained when rank is omitted. This finding also holds in non-linear and heterogeneous peer effects models and helps clarify the mechanisms behind the effects of ability tracking policies.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001992
Journal of Public Economics,2023,Pretrial juvenile detention,"E. Jason Baron, Brian Jacob and Joseph Ryan","Roughly one in four juveniles arrested in the U.S. spend time in a detention center prior to their court date. To study the consequences of this practice for youth, we link the universe of individual public school records in Michigan to juvenile and adult criminal justice records. Using a selection-on-observables design, we estimate that juvenile detention leads to a 38% decline in the likelihood of graduating high school and a 27% increase in the likelihood of being arrested as an adult by age 19. Falsification tests suggest the results are not driven by unobserved heterogeneity.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722002006
