Journal of Political Economy,2025,Macroeconomics after Lucas,Thomas J. Sargent,"This sequel to Lucas and Sargent (1978) tells how equilibrium Markov processes underlie much applied dynamic economics today. It recalls how Robert E. Lucas Jr. saw Keynesian and rational expectations revolutions as interconnected transformations of economic theories and econometric practices. It describes rules that Lucas used to guide and constrain his research by restricting himself to equilibrium Markov processes and to conserving quantitative successes achieved by previous researchers, including those attained by quantitative Keynesian macroeconometric modelers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/737999

Journal of Political Economy,2025,Robert Lucas’s Models of Firm Size Distributions and Investment,Boyan Jovanovic,"This paper examines three influential papers by Lucas that have become essential references in the economic literature. The first paper explores the size distributions of firms, while the other two investigate the relationship between firms’ investments, their valuations, and their rates of growth. These seminal papers have inspired numerous subsequent studies, significantly advancing our understanding of firm dynamics and investment behavior.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738000
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Lucas on Economic Development,Nancy L. Stokey,"In his work on economic development, Lucas’s goals were to understand the enormous diversity across countries in levels and growth rates of per capita income and to build a framework for studying developing economies with the same kind of precision and rigor that the neoclassical growth model had brought to the study of already industrialized countries. Lucas found knowledge spillovers to be a key mechanism. Thus, human capital, which he viewed broadly, is at the center of much of his work, and external effects are crucial. Lucas stated explicitly that in his view, physical capital plays a distinctly secondary role.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738002
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Asset-Price Redistribution,"Andreas Fagereng, Matthieu Gomez, Émilien Gouin-Bonenfant, Martin Holm, Benjamin Moll and Gisle Natvik","Asset valuations across many asset classes have increased substantially over the past several decades. While these rising valuations had important effects on the distribution of wealth, little is known regarding their redistributive effects in terms of welfare. To make progress on this question, we develop a sufficient statistic for the money-metric welfare gain of deviations in asset valuations. This welfare gain depends on the present value of an individual’s net asset sales rather than asset holdings: higher asset valuations benefit prospective sellers and harm prospective buyers. We estimate this quantity using panel microdata covering the universe of financial transactions in Norway from 1994 to 2019. We further demonstrate how to adapt our baseline statistic to account for important considerations, such as incomplete markets and collateral constraints. We find that the rise in asset valuations had large redistributive effects: it redistributed from the young to the old and from the poor to the wealthy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736769
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Vacancy Chains,"Michael W. L. Elsby, Axel Gottfries, Ryan Michaels and David Ratner","Replacement hiring plays a central role in establishment dynamics. US establishments frequently report no net change in their employment, often for years, despite facing substantial gross turnover. We devise a tractable model in which replacement hiring is driven by a novel structure of frictions, combining firm dynamics, on-the-job search, and investments into job creation that are sunk at the point of replacement. A key implication is the emergence of vacancy chains. Quantitatively, the model reconciles the incidence of replacement hiring with large cross-establishment dispersion in labor productivity and largely replicates the volatility and persistence of job creation and unemployment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/737234
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Opening Up Military Innovation: Causal Effects of Reforms to US Defense Research,"Sabrina T. Howell, Jason Rathje, John van Reenen and Jun Wong","For governments procuring innovation, one choice is whether to specify desired products (a conventional approach) or allow firms to suggest ideas (an open approach). Using a US Air Force R&D grant program where open and conventional competitions were held simultaneously, we find that open awards increase both commercial innovation and technology adoption by the military. In contrast, conventional awards have no positive effects on new technology but do create more program lock-in. We present evidence that openness matters over and above inducing differential selection, for example, of less well-established firms. These results suggest benefits from open approaches to innovation procurement.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/737235
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Subsidizing Business Entry in Competitive Credit Markets,"Vincenzo Cuciniello, Claudio Michelacci and Luigi Paciello","We study business creation subsidies in a general equilibrium model where firms are financially constrained upon entry and borrow competitively by issuing long-term debt. If paid out before business formation (ex ante), the subsidy reduces start-ups’ debt and bankruptcy rates; if paid out as a refund of expenditures (ex post), it reduces equity rather than debt, raising bankruptcies among both new and existing firms. In a model calibrated to Southern Italy, the optimal subsidy is paid entirely ex ante, raising welfare by 2% of consumption. If paid ex post, the same subsidy would result in welfare losses.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/737231
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Changes in Marital Sorting: Theory and Evidence from the United States,"Pierre-André Chiappori, Monica Costa Dias, Costas Meghir and Hanzhe Zhang","Positive assortative matching refers to the tendency of individuals with similar characteristics to form partnerships. Measuring the extent to which assortative matching differs between two economies is challenging when the marginal distributions of the sorting characteristic (e.g., education) change for either or both sexes. We show how the use of different measures can generate different conclusions. We provide an axiomatic characterization for the odds ratio, normalized trace, and likelihood ratio and provide a structural economic interpretation of the odds ratio. We use our approach to show that marital sorting by education substantially changed between the 1950s and the 1970s cohorts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736764
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Black Empowerment and White Mobilization: The Effects of the Voting Rights Act,"Andrea Bernini, Giovanni Facchini, Marco Tabellini and Cecilia Testa","How did Southern whites respond to the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA)? Leveraging newly digitized data on county-level voter registration by race between 1956 and 1980 and exploiting predetermined variation in exposure to the federal intervention, we document that the VRA increases both Black and white political participation. Consistent with the VRA triggering white countermobilization, the surge in white registrations is concentrated in counties where African Americans represent a political threat. Countermobilization leads to a short-run increase in support for racially conservative candidates and to a slowdown in local public spending salient to Black Americans, such as public-sector employment and education.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736766
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Leveraging the Disagreement on Climate Change: Theory and Evidence,"Laura Bakkensen, Toàn Phan and Tsz-Nga Wong","We develop a credit search model with maturity choice where agents disagree on when a long-run disaster will damage collateral assets. It predicts that disaster-pessimistic agents are more likely to leverage risky asset purchases and prefer debt contracts with longer maturities. Intuitively, pessimists value the default option of debt contracts as implicit disaster insurance, whose coverage increases with maturity implicitly and costs less to optimistic lenders. Using high-resolution sea level rise projections and comprehensive propriety data on coastal real estate and mortgages, we find robust evidence of these predictions. The findings provide relevant policy implications on insurance mandates, securitization, disaster assistance, and financial stability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/737236
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Persuaded Search,"Teddy Mekonnen, Zeky Murra-Anton and Bobak Pakzad-Hurson","We consider sequential search by an agent who cannot observe the quality of goods but can acquire information from a profit-maximizing principal with limited commitment power. The principal can charge higher prices for more informative signals, but high future prices discourage continued search, thereby reducing the principal’s profits. A unique stationary equilibrium outcome exists: the principal (i) sells the agent only partial information, (ii) induces the socially efficient stopping rule, and (iii) extracts the full surplus. However, introducing an additional, free source of information can lead to inefficiency in equilibrium.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736765
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Selecting Penalty Parameters of High-Dimensional M-Estimators Using Bootstrapping after Cross Validation,Denis Chetverikov and Jesper Riis-Vestergaard Sørensen,"We develop a new method for selecting the penalty parameter for ℓ1-penalized M-estimators in high dimensions, which we refer to as bootstrapping after cross validation. We derive rates of convergence for the corresponding ℓ1-penalized M-estimator and also for the post-ℓ1-penalized M-estimator, which refits the nonzero entries of the former estimator without penalty in the criterion function. We demonstrate via simulations that our methods are not dominated by cross validation in terms of estimation errors and can outperform cross validation in terms of inference. As an empirical illustration, we revisit Fryer (2019), who investigated racial differences in police use of force, and confirm his findings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736770
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Religious Divisions and Production Technology: Experimental Evidence from India,Arkadev Ghosh,"This paper implements a field experiment in India to study whether the effects of religious diversity on productivity and attitudes depend on a firm’s production technology. I randomly assigned Hindu and Muslim workers at a manufacturing plant in West Bengal to mixed or homogeneous teams. Production tasks are categorized as high or low dependency based on the degree of continuous coordination required. Mixed teams are less productive than homogeneous teams in high-dependency tasks, but this effect attenuates completely in 4 months. In low-dependency tasks, diversity does not affect productivity. However, mixing improves Hindu workers’ out-group attitudes only in high-dependency tasks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736212
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Persuasion and Information Aggregation in Elections,Carl Heese and Stephan Lauermann,"This paper studies a large majority election with voters who have heterogeneous private preferences and exogenous private information about an unknown state of the world. We show that a Bayesian persuader can achieve any state-contingent outcome in some equilibrium by providing additional information. In this setting, without the persuader’s additional information, a version of the Condorcet jury theorem holds, in the sense that outcomes of large elections satisfy full-information equivalence. Persuasion does not require detailed knowledge of the voters’ private information, preferences, or the voting rule. It also requires almost no commitment power on the part of the persuader.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736767
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Rationed Fertility: Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in the Child Quantity-Quality Trade-Off,"Rufei Guo, Junjian Yi, Junsen Zhang and Ning Zhang",We develop a generalized theory of rationed fertility to analyze treatment effect heterogeneity in the child quantity-quality trade-off. An exogenous increase in fertility can be either desired or undesired. We derive a positive rationing income effect on child quality for desired fertility increases but a negative rationing income effect for undesired fertility increases. We propose an econometric framework to identify treatment effects of desired and undesired fertility increases and estimate a structural model to gauge the quantitative importance of the novel rationing income effect. Our study highlights the importance of distinguishing between desired and undesired changes when evaluating social programs.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736768
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Of Cities and Slums,"Pedro Ferreira, Alexander Monge-Naranjo and Luciene Torres  de Mello Pereira","We study the emergence and persistence of urban slums in Brazil. Using data on labor markets, housing costs, and access to education, we construct a quantitative model to explore the impact of slums on the country’s human capital and structural transformation. Urban slums emerge and persist due to their dual roles as intergenerational stepping stones for low-educated households and as blockades for higher-educated ones. Providing slum children access to schools in formal urban areas would have led to larger but shorter-lived slums. Improved rural schools, if available earlier during urbanization, would have vastly prevented the formation of urban slums.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736210
Journal of Political Economy,2025,The Labor Market Effects of Legal Restrictions on Worker Mobility,"Matthew S. Johnson, Kurt Lavetti and Michael Lipsitz","We analyze how the legal enforceability of noncompete agreements (NCAs) affects labor markets. Using newly constructed panel data, we find that higher NCA enforceability diminishes workers’ earnings and job mobility, with larger effects among workers most likely to sign NCAs. These effects are far-reaching: increasing enforceability imposes externalities on workers across state borders, suggesting broad effects on labor market dynamism. We show that enforceability affects wages by reducing outside options and preventing workers from leveraging tight labor markets to increase earnings. We motivate these findings with a model of search and bargaining. Finally, higher NCA enforceability exacerbates gender and racial earnings gaps.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736217
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Risk and Information in Dispute Resolution: An Empirical Study of Arbitration,"Yunmi Kong, Bernardo S. Silveira and Xun Tang","We develop and estimate a structural model of arbitration, accounting for asymmetric risk attitudes and learning. Using data on public sector wage disputes in New Jersey, we compare the efficiency of two popular arbitration formats: final offer and conventional. We find that although conventional arbitration hinders the transmission of case-relevant information from the disputants to the arbitrator, this format outperforms final offer arbitration by affording discretion to select awards. We also assess how risk attitude differences between the disputants affect imbalances in arbitration outcomes, finding that risk aversion weakens a party’s position in the dispute despite making them more likely to win arbitration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736216
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Micro and Macro Effects of Unemployment Insurance Policies: Evidence from Missouri,"Fatih Karahan, Kurt Mitman and Brendan Moore","We develop a method to jointly measure the response of worker search effort (micro effect) and vacancy creation (macro effect) to changes in the duration of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. To implement this approach, we exploit an unexpected cut in UI durations in Missouri and provide quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of UI on the labor market. In our baseline specification, the data indicate that the cut in Missouri increased job-finding rates by 12% by raising firm vacancy creation and the search effort of unemployed workers. Both channels contribute roughly equally to the total effect.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736215
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Can Redistribution Change Policy Views? Aid and Attitudes toward Refugees,"Travis Baseler, Thomas Ginn, Robert Hakiza, Helidah Ogude-Chambert and Olivia Woldemikael","Many public policies create winners and losers, but it is unclear whether redistribution can support new political economy equilibria that raise aggregate welfare. We study policies that partially redistribute foreign aid for refugees to natives while allowing refugees to work and move freely. Cash grants to Ugandan and Kenyan natives, labeled as aid from the refugee response, substantially increase support for refugee integration. Information about existing redistribution has significant but smaller effects. In contrast, intergroup contact yields no persistent, measurable effects. Our results indicate that economic interventions can shape policy views even on issues influenced by cultural concerns, such as immigration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736209
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Welfare Assessments with Heterogeneous Individuals,Eduardo Dávila and Andreas Schaab,"This paper introduces a decomposition of welfare assessments for general dynamic stochastic economies with heterogeneous individuals. The decomposition is based on constructing individual, dynamic, and stochastic weights that characterize how welfarist planners make trade-offs across individuals, dates, and histories. Guided by the compensation principle, it initially decomposes a welfare assessment into an efficiency and a redistribution component, while the efficiency component is further decomposed into (1) aggregate efficiency, (2) risk sharing, and (3) intertemporal sharing components. Five minimal examples and three applications illustrate the properties of the decomposition and how it can be used to draw normative conclusions in specific scenarios.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736211
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Disability Insurance: Error Rates and Gender Differences,Hamish Low and Luigi Pistaferri,"We show the extent of screening errors made in disability insurance awards using matched survey-administrative data. False rejections are widespread, with large gender differences. Work-disabled women are 12.8 percentage points more likely to be rejected than work-disabled men, controlling for health conditions, occupation, and demographics. Gender differences arise because women are assessed with more residual work capacity. We model the Social Security Administration (SSA) decision-making process and estimate that gender differences in screening errors originate from lower costs to the SSA from incorrectly rejecting women. Noise in self-reported work limitation leads to overstating screening errors, but the gender difference remains.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736207
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Optimal Information Design of Online Marketplaces with Return Rights,Jonas  von Wangenheim,"Consumer data increasingly enable online marketplaces to identify buyers’ preferences and provide individualized product information. Buyers, however, fully learn their product value only after contracting, when the product is delivered. I characterize the impact of such ex ante information on buyer surplus and seller surplus, when the seller sets prices and refund conditions in response to the ex ante information. I show that efficient trade and an arbitrary split of the surplus can be achieved. For the buyer-optimal signal, low-valuation buyers remain partially uninformed. Such a signal induces the seller to sell at low prices without refund options.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/736214
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Dynamic Pricing Regulation and Welfare in Insurance Markets,Naoki Aizawa and Ami Ko,"While the traditional role of insurers is to provide protection against individuals’ idiosyncratic risks, insurers themselves face substantial uncertainties due to aggregate shocks. To prevent insurers from passing these aggregate risks onto consumers, governments have increasingly adopted dynamic pricing regulations, which limit insurers’ ability to change premiums over time. We evaluate dynamic pricing regulation using an equilibrium model of the US long-term care insurance market, featuring insurers’ lack of commitment and endogenous market structures. We find that stricter dynamic pricing regulation has a limited impact on improving consumer welfare, while it reduces insurer profits and increases market concentration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/735512
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Combating Political Corruption with Policy Bundles,Frederico Finan and Maurizio Mazzocco,"In this paper, we develop a dynamic model of politicians who can engage in corruption. The model provides important insights into the determinants of corruption and how to design policies to combat it. We estimate the model using data from Brazil to measure voters’ willingness to pay for various commonly proposed anticorruption policies, such as increasing audit probabilities, raising politicians’ wages, and extending term limits. We document that while audit policies effectively reduce corruption, a multipronged approach that bundles an audit policy with other policies can achieve much higher welfare gains.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/735508

Miller and Joel Stiebale","We analyze the evolution of markups for consumer products in the United States from 2006 to 2019. Using detailed data on prices and quantities for products in more than 100 distinct categories, we obtain a panel of markups, marginal costs, and flexible consumer preferences. Our empirical strategy uses separate random coefficients logit models for each category and year and an assumption that firms set prices to maximize profits. We find that markups increased by about 30% on average over the sample period. We attribute this change to decreases in marginal costs and a decline in consumer price sensitivity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/735510
Journal of Political Economy,2025,The Allocation of Incentives in Multilayered Organizations: Evidence from a Community Health Program in Sierra Leone,"Erika Deserranno, A. Stefano Caria, Philipp Kastrau and Gianmarco León-Ciliotta","Does the allocation of incentives across the hierarchy of an organization matter for its performance? In an experiment with a large public health organization, we find that health care provision is highly affected by how incentives are allocated between frontline workers and their supervisors. Sharing incentives equally between these two layers raises health visits by 61% compared with unilateral allocations and uniquely improves health service provision and health outcomes. We provide reduced-form and structural evidence that effort complementarities and contractual frictions drive these results and explore the implications for the optimal design of incentive policies in multilayered organizations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/735511
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Bidding for Firms: Subsidy Competition in the United States,Cailin Slattery,"State and local governments in the United States compete to attract firms by offering discretionary subsidies. I use a private value English auction to model the subsidy bidding process and quantify the welfare effects of competition. The allocation of rents between states and firms depends on the heterogeneity in states’ valuations for firms and the substitutability of locations. I find that competition increases welfare by less than 5% over a subsidy ban, and states compete away the surplus, transferring all of the rents to firms. These findings dampen any interpretation of subsidy competition as an effective place-based policy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/735509
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Factor Models for Conditional Asset Pricing,Paolo Zaffaroni,"This paper develops a methodology, building on a local principal component analysis approach, for inference on the pricing ability of conditional asset pricing models designed to mitigate the effect of omitted risk factors and misspecified conditional dynamics. The methodology is designed to exploit the rich information available in large cross sections of individual stocks.

Journal of Political Economy,2025,"Soil Heterogeneity, Social Learning, and the Formation of Close-Knit Communities",Itzchak Tzachi Raz,"This paper examines how environmental heterogeneity influences the formation of close-knit communities. I provide support for the social learning hypothesis, which posits that diverse environmental conditions limited American farmers’ ability to learn from neighbors, weakening communal ties. I document a negative county-level association between soil heterogeneity and close-knit communities. Using individual-level data on nineteenth-century domestic migrants, I show that this association is not driven by selective in-migration and document farmers’ cultural adaptation using a difference-in-differences framework. Focusing on mechanisms, I show that soil heterogeneity slowed farmers’ agricultural learning and prompted those who depended on social networks to migrate elsewhere.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/735506
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Asymmetric Information Sharing in Oligopoly: A Natural Experiment in Retail Gasoline,"David P. Byrne, Nicolas  de Roos, Matthew Lewis, Leslie M. Marx and Xiaosong Wu","Using a natural experiment from a retail gasoline antitrust case, we study how asymmetric information sharing affects oligopoly pricing. Empirically, price competition softens when, following case settlement, information sharing shifts from symmetric to asymmetric, with one firm losing access to high-frequency granular rival price data. We provide theory and empirics illustrating how strategic ignorance creates price commitment, leading to higher price-cost margins. Using a structural model, we find substantial profit-enhancing effects of asymmetric information sharing. These results provide a cautionary tale for antitrust agencies regarding the potential unintended consequences of limiting price information sharing among firms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734872
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Panics and Early Warnings,Deepal Basak and Zhen Zhou,"We study optimal adversarial information design in a dynamic regime change game. Agents decide when to attack, if at all. We assume (1) delay incurs a continuous cost and (2) agents doubt the correctness of their actions. The game may end in a “disaster” due to weak fundamentals or panic—agents attacking despite sound fundamentals. We propose a “timely disaster alert” that promptly warns about impending disasters, making waiting for and following the alert the unique rationalizable strategy, thereby eliminating panic. We relate this optimal policy to early-warning systems such as bank stress tests and debt sustainability analysis.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734875
Journal of Political Economy,2025,"More Laws, More Growth? Evidence from US States","Elliott Ash, Massimo Morelli and Matia Vannoni","This paper analyzes the conditions under which more legislation contributes to economic growth. In the context of US states, we apply natural language processing tools to measure legislative flows for the years 1965–2012. We implement a novel shift-share design for text data, where the instrument for legislation is leave-one-out legal topic flows interacted with pretreatment legal topic shares. We find that at the margin, higher legislative output causes more economic growth. Consistent with more complete laws reducing ex post holdup, we find that the effect is driven by the use of contingent clauses, is largest in sectors with high relationship-specific investments, and is increasing with local economic uncertainty.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734874
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Policy Experimentation in China: The Political Economy of Policy Learning,Shaoda Wang and David Y. Yang,"Governments use policy experiments to facilitate learning, but the nature and effects of these experiments remain unclear. We analyze China's policy experimentation since 1980—among the most systematic in history—and document three facts. First, most experiments exhibit positive sample selection. Second, local politicians exert excessive efforts during experiments that are not replicable during policies’ national rollout. Third, the central government is not fully sophisticated when interpreting experimentation outcomes. These facts suggest that policy learning may be biased and national policies may be distorted. Thus, while China’s institutions enable experimentation at an unparalleled scale, the complex political environments can also limit effective policy learning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734873

Book authorship is now an exception: women now publish more than half of new books. Adding new products can have significant welfare benefits, particularly when product quality is unpredictable. Growth in female-authored books has delivered substantial increases in the female-authored shares of consumption, book awards, and other measures of success, indicating that the additional female-authored books are useful to consumers.

If attention costs satisfy an invariance condition embedded in Sims’s mutual information specification, a version of the first welfare theorem holds no matter the degree of inattention. More generally, however, a cognitive externality may emerge, and welfare may be improved by regulating and simplifying markets. We discuss how these results qualify Hayek’s argument about the informational optimality of the price system, how they link the normative question of interest to a decision-theoretic literature on stochastic choice, and how they separate paternalistic and nonpaternalistic approaches to modeling inattention.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734870

We first study a tractable model and show that the steady-state optimal capital tax can be positive if credit constraints are occasionally binding. However, the existence of such an equilibrium depends on the shape of the utility function. We also characterize the optimal dynamic of public debt after a public spending shock. We confirm these findings by solving for optimal policy in a general heterogeneous-agent model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734877

Empirical estimates using a global sample of firms suggest that rising temperatures reduce productivity less in nonagriculture than angriculture, implying large potential gains if hot countries could increase food imports and shift labor toward manufacturing. However, model counterfactuals show that subsistence consumption needs and high trade barriers combine to create a “food problem” in which climate change instead intensifies agricultural specialization in especially vulnerable regions. Simulations suggest that reducing trade barriers can significantly reduce climate damages, especially in poor countries.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734725

This paper quantifies uncertainty surrounding the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). We estimate a dynamic oligopoly model for coal-fired electricity generators that recovers generators’ beliefs regarding future MATS enforcement. We develop the approximate belief oligopoly equilibrium concept, where players understand that their decisions impact aggregate market states. MATS enforcement created substantial uncertainty: the perceived enforcement probability dropped to 43%. Resolving uncertainty early would increase profits by $1.39 billion but also increase pollution costs by $0.652–$1.776 billion.

Journal of Political Economy,2025,Colluding against Workers,Vincent Delabastita and Michael Rubens,"Empirical models of labor market competition usually assume that employers set wages noncooperatively, despite frequent allegations of collusive employer behavior. We propose an identification approach for labor market collusion that relies on production and cost data, and we use it to study how employer collusion affected wage markdowns of 227 Belgian coal firms between 1845 and 1913. We are able to detect collusion through the 1897 coal cartel without ex ante knowledge of its timing and find that it explains the fast growth in markdowns after 1900. We find that the cartel decreased both wages and employment by 6% to 17%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734780

We show that GLTHI’s contract design coincides with the optimal dynamic contract for individuals with constant lifetime income profiles. After estimating the key ingredients of a life-cycle model, we find that, under a variety of assumptions, GLTHI achieves welfare that is at most 4% lower than for the optimal contract. Relative to the gains of replacing short-term contracts with either of the two long-term contracts, this welfare gap is smallest when reclassification risk is high.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734781

The bounds are probabilities that an action is dominant and that it is not dominated. Because the bounds are easy to compute, our method is scalable to models with many firms and discrete decisions.

Journal of Political Economy,2025,Estimating an Auction Platform Game with Two-Sided Entry,Marleen Marra,This paper develops and estimates a structural auction platform model with endogenous entry of buyers and sellers to study the welfare impacts of fee changes. Estimates from a new wine auction dataset illustrate the striking feature of two-sided markets that some users can be made better off despite paying higher fees. The results also underscore the importance of addressing seller selection when endogenizing (buyer) entry onto auction platforms. Quantifying the welfare effects from (anticompetitive) fee changes through a model that accounts for important user interactions enables antitrust policy to be applied to such markets.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734722

Then, we estimate how innovating firms respond to changes in their downstream firms’ low- and high-skill wages. We compute these wages by combining macroeconomic data on 41 countries with innovating firms’ global market exposure. Higher low-skill wages increase automation innovation (but not other machinery innovation), with an elasticity of 2–5. Finally, we show that the German Hartz labor market reforms reduced automation innovations by foreign firms more exposed to Germany.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734778

Scott","We develop a model of competition in prices and infrastructure among mobile network operators. Although consolidation increases market power, it can lead to more efficient data transmission due to economies of scale, which we derive from physical principles. After estimating our model with French consumer and infrastructure data, equilibrium simulations reveal that while prices decrease with the number of firms, so do download speeds. Our framework also allows us to quantify the impact of spectrum allocation. The marginal social value of spectrum exceeds firms’ willingness to pay in our model as well as observed prices in spectrum auctions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734132
Journal of Political Economy,2025,Misconduct and Reputation under Imperfect Information,Francis Annan,"Misconduct—market actions that are unethical and indicative of fraud—is a significant yet poorly understood issue that underlies many economic transactions. We design a field experiment to study the impact of two-sided antimisconduct information programs, which we deploy on the local markets for mobile money (“human ATMs”) in Ghana. The programs lead to a large reduction in misconduct (−21⁢ percentage points=−72%) and, as a result, broader improvements in overall market activity, consumer welfare, and firm revenue. We show the treatment effect is due to a combination of more accurate consumer beliefs about misconduct and increased vendor reputation concerns.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734133

Little is known, however, about the magnitude of the welfare gains from such interventions. We develop an empirical strategy that leverages commonly available trade data to estimate sector-level economies of scale and, in turn, to quantify the gains from optimal industrial policy in a general equilibrium environment. Our results point toward significant economies of scale across manufacturing sectors but gains from industrial policy that are hardly transformative, even among the most open economies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734129

Our model focuses on the interaction between successive deficit-biased governments subject to independently and identically distributed fiscal shocks. We show that the economy transitions between a fiscally responsible regime and a fiscally irresponsible regime, with transitions occurring during crises when fiscal needs are large. Under fiscal responsibility, governments limit their spending to avoid transitioning to fiscal irresponsibility. Under fiscal irresponsibility, governments spend excessively and precipitate crises that lead to the reinstatement of fiscal responsibility. Regime transitions can occur only if governments’ deficit bias is large enough.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734131

Between 2003 and 2017, Medicare spent $7.7 billion on 37.5 million regularly scheduled ambulance rides for patients traveling to and from dialysis facilities even though many did not satisfy Medicare’s criteria for receiving reimbursements.

From 1989 to 2017, the real per capita value of corporate equity increased at a 7.2% annual rate. We estimate that 40% of this increase was attributable to a reallocation of rewards to shareholders in a decelerating economy, primarily at the expense of labor compensation. Economic growth accounted for just 25% of the increase, followed by a lower risk price (21%) and lower interest rates (14%). The period 1952–88 experienced only one-third as much growth in market equity, but economic growth accounted for more than 100% of it.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734089

The model’s dynamics are driven by innovation and technology licensing. Imperfect IP enforcement leads to reduced royalty payments and growth. Governments negotiate tariffs and IP enforcement through Nash bargaining. Gains from the trade agreement vary along the transition. Developing countries experience short-term losses, while developed countries gain in both the short and long runs. A government with short-term goals may reduce losses but at the cost of lower growth and welfare.

The analysis, based on German panel data, reveals that both cognitive and noncognitive traits significantly influence wages and employment outcomes.

We show that a signal that pools at most two states in each realization is always optimal and that such “pairwise” signals are the only solutions under a nonsingularity condition on utilities. Our core results provide conditions under which the induced receiver action is single-dipped or single-peaked on each set of nested signal realizations. We also provide conditions for the optimality of either full disclosure or negative assortative disclosure, where all signal realizations are nested. Methodologically, our results rely on novel duality and complementary slackness theorems. Our analysis extends to a general problem of assigning one-dimensional inputs to productive units, which we call “optimal productive transport.” This problem covers additional applications including matching with peer effects (assigning workers to firms, students to schools, or residents to neighborhoods), robust option pricing (assigning future asset prices to price distributions), and partisan gerrymandering (assigning voters to districts).",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734095

We find that the effects of China’s 1980 Normal Trade Relations (NTR) grant lasted past its 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the likelihood of losing NTR status decreased significantly during 1986–92 but changed little thereafter.

Journal of Political Economy,2025,Financial Product Design in Decentralized Markets,Marzena Rostek and Ji Hee Yoon,"Decentralized trading motivates financial innovation, making synthetic products like derivatives nonredundant, even when all traders trade all assets. This nonredundancy arises because derivatives affect cross-security inference (information) and, in markets with large traders, equilibrium price impact (liquidity). The efficient securities differ from the underlying assets. While the market index/mutual funds are efficient in decentralized markets with competitive investors, heterogeneous portfolios that balance index tracking with liquidity transformation become efficient in markets with large traders. Efficient securities facilitate the trading of all fundamental risks but generally forgo hedging all contingencies to minimize the price impact costs associated with risk sharing and diversification.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/733422

The model accounts for the entire crisis cycle, matching data on the frothy precrisis behavior of asset markets and credit; the sharp transition to a crisis where asset values fall, disintermediation occurs, and output falls; and the slow postcrisis recovery in output.

Decisions are partitioned into modules and require closer coordination within modules than across. Each agent knows the state his decision must be adapted to. The principal decides whom each agent tells about his state, given that each communication link comes at a cost.

Accordingly, we propose a modified version of IIA, MIIA, that is a necessary and sufficient relaxation of IIA for taking account of intensities.

We turn to a long span of history in the United Kingdom to test this hypothesis. Using a new long-run dataset of narrative-identified tax changes from 1918 to 2020, we show that tax cuts are expansionary in both low-interest-rate environments and more normal times.
