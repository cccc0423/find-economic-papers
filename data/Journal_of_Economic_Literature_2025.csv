Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Examiner and Judge Designs in Economics: A Practitioner's Guide,"Eric Chyn, Brigham Frandsen and Emily Leslie","This article provides empirical researchers with an introduction and guide to research designs based on variation in judge and examiner tendencies to administer treatments or other interventions. We review the basic theory behind this research design, outline the assumptions under which the design identifies causal effects, describe empirical tests of the conditions for identification, and discuss trade-offs associated with choices researchers must make for estimation. We demonstrate concepts and best practices in an empirical case study that uses an examiner tendency research design to study the effects of pretrial detention.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241719
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Social Preferences: Fundamental Characteristics and Economic Consequences,Ernst Fehr and Gary Charness,"We review the vast literature on social preferences by assessing what is known about their fundamental properties, their distribution in the broader population, and their consequences for important economic and political behaviors. We provide, in particular, an overview of the empirical characteristics of distributional preferences and how they are affected by merit, luck, and concerns for equality of opportunity. In addition, we discuss the evidence for reciprocity and guilt aversion and assess the empirical relevance of self-image and social image concerns in prosocial behaviors. The overall evidence indicates that a large majority of individuals have some sort of social preferences, while purely self-interested subjects are a minority. We also document converging insights from the lab and the field on the impact of wage inequality on work morale, employees' resistance to wage cuts, and the role of social preferences for cooperation and collective action, distributive politics, and individuals' selection into different occupations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241391
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,"Of Markets and Marriages: A Multidisciplinary, Multi-book Review Essay of Recent Work on the Causes of US Poverty",Elizabeth Oltmans Ananat,"How is it that in perhaps the richest country in the history of the world such a large number of people struggle to acquire the basic necessities of life? Clearly, merely increasing the total quantity of goods and services produced in the market does not address this core problem. I review new work both inside and outside of economics that seeks to understand the persistence of poverty in the United States. With a particular focus on Desmond (2023) and Kearney (2023), I draw out the hypotheses in this work, suggest interesting avenues for future research, and discuss potential policy implications.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241734
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Aggregate Shocks and the Formation of Preferences and Beliefs,Paola Giuliano and Antonio Spilimbergo,"A growing body of work highlights how aggregate shocks shape preferences and beliefs. This review synthesizes findings from sociology, social psychology, and economics to explore the significance of these shocks, how the period in which they are experienced matters, and their lasting effects. It examines economic shocks such as recessions, inflation, and trade shocks, alongside noneconomic shocks like migrations, wars, terrorist attacks, pandemics, and natural disasters. Key conclusions emerge: aggregate shocks influence political preferences, risk attitudes, and institutional trust; experiences during young adulthood have stronger, enduring impacts; and economic shocks generally shift preferences toward the political right, while noneconomic yield more varied outcomes depending on the context. The review also evaluates empirical methodologies, their limitations, and mechanisms underlying these effects. By analyzing how shocks alter societal values and behaviors across generations, this work provides insights into the long-term consequences of major disruptions on individual and collective decision-making.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241674
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Consumer Credit Reporting Data,"Christa Gibbs, Benedict Guttman-Kenney, Donghoon Lee, Scott Nelson, Wilbert van der Klaauw and Jialan Wang","Since the 2000s, economists across fields have increasingly used consumer credit reporting data for research. We introduce readers to the economics and institutional details of these data. Using examples from the literature, we provide practical guidance on how to use these data to construct economic measures of borrowing, consumption,credit access, financial distress, and geographic mobility. We explain what credit scores measure and why. We highlight how researchers can access credit reporting data via existing datasets or by creating new datasets, including by linking credit reporting data with surveys and external datasets.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241737
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,"Culture, Institutions, and Social Equilibria: A Framework",Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson,"This paper proposes a new framework for studying the interplay between culture and institutions. We interpret culture as a repertoire, consisting of (cultural) attributes and allowing rich cultural responses to political changes. Combinations of attributes produce cultural configurations, which provide social meaning, coordination, and political justification. Our framework has several distinctive features. First, it proposes a ""systems approach"" to culture: the meaning and function of attributes are determined within the whole configuration and political equilibrium. Second, it emphasizes discontinuous or ""saltational"" changes in culture—rather than gradual, evolutionary changes—as attributes are reconnected and acquire new meanings in response to evolving circumstances and as outcomes in ongoing ""cultural struggles."" Third, our frame work puts the spotlight on how fluidly different cultures can respond to conditions, depending on the nature of their attributes and constraints on their connections. Finally, it enriches the study of the codetermination of political, institutional and cultural outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241680

Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Deep Learning for Economists,Melissa Dell,"Deep learning provides powerful methods to impute structured information from large-scale, unstructured text and image datasets. For example, economists might wish to detect the presence of economic activity in satellite images, or to measure the topics or entities mentioned in social media, the congressional record, or firm filings. This review introduces deep neural networks, covering methods such as classifiers, regression models, generative artificial intelligence (AI), and embedding models. Applications include classification, document digitization, record linkage, and methods for data exploration in massive scale text and image corpora. When suitable methods are used, deep learning models can be cheap to tune and can scale affordably to problems involving millions or billions of data points. The review is accompanied by a regularly updated companion website, EconDL (https://econdl.github.io/), with user-friendly demo notebooks, software resources, and a knowledge base that provides technical details and additional applications.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241733
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Local Projections,Oscar Jorda and Alan M. Taylor,"A central question in applied research is to estimate the effect of an exogenous intervention or shock on an outcome. The intervention can affect the outcome and controls on impact and over time. Moreover, there can be subsequent feedback between outcomes, controls, and the intervention. Many of these interactions can be untangled using local projections. This method's simplicity makes it a convenient and versatile tool in the empiricist's kit, one that is generalizable to complex settings. This article reviews the state of the art for the practitioner and discusses best practices and possible extensions of local projections methods, along with their limitations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241521
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Structural Reforms and Economic Performance: The Experience of Advanced Economies,"Nauro F. Campos, Paul  De Grauwe and Yuemei Ji","This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the theoretical and empirical literature on structural reforms in advanced economies. Structural reforms matter because they entail profound and systematic changes that affect economic welfare, productivity, growth, unemployment, macroeconomic stability, and income inequality. Here we focus on structural reforms in product, labor, and financial markets. After putting forward a set of stylized facts, we take stock of the literature on each of these three key structural reforms, and then assess their business cycle and political economy implications. We underscore various gaps in the literature and articulate a future research agenda that highlights four main areas: measurement, interactions among reforms, political economy considerations, and the timing of the implementation of reforms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20231527
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Data Engineering for Cognitive Economics,Andrew Caplin,"Cognitive economics studies imperfect information and decision-making mistakes. A central scientific challenge is that these can't be identified in standard choice data. Overcoming this challenge calls for data engineering, in which new data forms are introduced to separately identify preferences, beliefs, and other model constructs. I present applications to traditional areas of economic research, such as wealth accumulation, earnings, and consumer spending. I also present less traditional applications to assessment of decision-making skills, and to human-AI interactions. Methods apply both to individual and to collective decisions. I make the case for broader application of data engineering beyond cognitive economics. It allows symbiotic advances in modeling and measurement. It cuts across existing boundaries between disciplines and styles of research.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241351
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,"Agent-Based Modeling in Economics and Finance: Past, Present, and Future",Robert L. Axtell and J. Doyne Farmer,"Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a novel computational methodology for representing the behavior of individuals in order to study social phenomena. Its use is rapidly growing in many fields. We review ABM in economics and finance and highlight how it can be used to relax conventional assumptions in standard economic models. ABM has enriched our understanding of markets, industrial organization, labor, macro, development, public policy, and environmental economics. In financial markets, substantial accomplishments include understanding clustered volatility, market impact, systemic risk, and housing markets. We present a vision for how ABMs might be used in the future to build more realistic models of the economy and review some of the hurdles that must be overcome to achieve this.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20221319
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,How the World Became Rich by Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin and Slouching Towards Utopia by J. Bradford DeLong: A Review Essay,Steven N. Durlauf,This essay reviews two recent books on economic growth: Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin's How the World Became Rich and J. Bradford DeLong's Slouching Towards Utopia. Both books offer rich and nuanced treatments of the long-run and proximate mechanisms underlying the global growth in the past centuries.
