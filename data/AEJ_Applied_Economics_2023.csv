AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,How Do Households Respond to Job Loss? Lessons from Multiple High-Frequency Datasets,"Asger Lau Andersen, Amalie Sofie Jensen, Niels Johannesen, Claus Thustrup Kreiner, Søren Leth-Petersen and Adam Sheridan","How much and through which channels do households self-insure against job loss? Combining data from a large bank and from government sources, we quantify a broad range of responses to job loss in a unified empirical framework. Cumulated over a two-year period, households reduce spending by 30 percent of their income loss. They mainly self-insure through adjustments of liquid balances, which account for 50 percent of the income loss. Other channels—spousal labor supply, private transfers, home equity extraction, mortgage refinancing, and consumer credit—contribute less to self-insurance. Both overall self-insurance and the channels vary with household characteristics in intuitive ways.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210206
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Improving Regulatory Effectiveness through Better Targeting: Evidence from OSHA,"Matthew S. Johnson, David Levine and Michael Toffel","We study how a regulator can best target inspections. Our case study is a US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) program that randomly allocated some inspections. On average, each inspection led to 2.4 (9 percent) fewer serious injuries over the next 5 years. Using new machine learning methods, we find that OSHA could have averted as much as twice as many injuries by targeting inspections to workplaces with the highest expected averted injuries and nearly as many by targeting the highest expected level of injuries. Either approach would have generated up to $850 million in social value over the decade we examine.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200659
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Temporal Instability of Risk Preference among the Poor: Evidence from Payday Cycles,"Mika Akesaka, Peter Eibich, Chie Hanaoka and Hitoshi Shigeoka","The poor live paycheck to paycheck and are repeatedly exposed to strong cyclical income fluctuations. We investigate whether such income fluctuations affect their risk preference. If risk preference temporarily changes around payday, optimal decisions made before payday may no longer be optimal afterward, which could reinforce poverty. By exploiting social security payday cycles in the United States, we find that the poor relying heavily on social security become more risk tolerant before payday. More than cognitive decline before payday, the deterioration of mental health and relative deprivation are likely to play a role. We find similar evidence among the Japanese elderly.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220073
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Coming Apart? Cultural Distances in the United States over Time,Marianne Bertrand and Emir Kamenica,"We analyze trends in cultural distances between groups in the United States defined by income, education, gender, race, and political ideology. We measure cultural distance as the ability to infer an individual's group based on media diet, consumer behavior, time use, social attitudes, or newborn's name. Gender difference in time-use decreased between 1965 and 1995 and has remained constant since. Differences in social attitudes by political ideology, and somewhat by income, have increased over the last four decades. Whites and non-Whites have diverged in consumer behavior. For all other demographic divisions and cultural dimensions, cultural distance has been broadly constant over time.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210663

We document null effects of immigration on crime but positive and significant effects on crime-related concerns and on preventive behavioral responses, such as investing in home security. We explore several channels and provide suggestive evidence related to low- versus high-education immigrants, ethnicity-related intergroup threats, and the role of local media.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210156
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Coordination and Bandwagon Effects: How Past Rankings Shape the Behavior of Voters and Candidates,"Riako Granzier, Vincent Pons and Clemence Tricaud","Candidates' placements in polls and past elections can be powerful coordination devices for parties and voters. Using a regression discontinuity design in French two-round elections, we show that candidates who place first in the first round are more likely to stay in the race and win than those who placed second. These effects are even larger for ranking second versus third, and also present for third versus fourth. They stem from allied parties agreeing on which candidate should drop out, voters coordinating their choice, and the bandwagon effect of wanting to vote for the winner. We find similar results across 19 other countries.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210840
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Contagious Dishonesty: Corruption Scandals and Supermarket Theft,Giorgio Gulino and Federico Masera,"Is dishonest behavior contagious? We answer this question by studying whether corruption scandals affect the propensity of supermarket customers to steal while using a self-service checkout system. Crucially, this system allows shoppers to engage in dishonest behavior by underreporting the value of their shopping cart. Exploiting data from random audits on shoppers, we show that the probability of stealing increases by 16 percent after a local corruption scandal breaks. This effect is not driven by any change in material incentives. Suggestive evidence shows that it is driven by a reduction in the self-imposed cost of stealing.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210446
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Collateralized Marriage,Jeanne Lafortune and Corinne Low,"Marriage rates have become increasingly stratified by homeownership. We investigate this in a household model where investments in public goods reduce future earnings and, thus, divorce risk creates inefficiencies. Access to a joint savings technology, like a house, collateralizes marriage, providing insurance to the lower-earning partner and increasing specialization, public goods, and value from marriage. We use idiosyncratic variation in housing prices to show that homeownership access indeed leads to greater specialization. The model also predicts that policies that erode the marriage contract in other ways will make wealth a more important determinant of marriage, which we confirm empirically.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210614
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,How Cable News Reshaped Local Government,Elliott Ash and Sergio Galletta,"This paper shows that partisan cable news broadcasts have a causal effect on the size and composition of budgets in US localities. Using exogenous channel positioning as an instrument for viewership, we show that exposure to the conservative Fox News channel reduces revenues and expenditures. Multiple mechanisms drive these results: Fox News improves election chances for local Republicans, alters politician campaign agendas, and shifts voter policy preferences on fiscal issues. Consistent with the priorities of small-government conservatism, we find evidence that private provision compensates for the reduced public services. The ""Fox News effect"" extends beyond vote shares to rightward policy shifts.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210501
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Hidden Income and the Perceived Returns to Migration,Travis Baseler,"In many developing economies, urban workers earn substantially more than rural workers with the same level of education. Why don't more rural workers migrate to cities? I use two field experiments in Kenya to show that low migration is partly due to underestimation of urban incomes, which is sustained by income hiding by migrants. Parents at the origin underestimate their migrant children's incomes by nearly half, and underestimation is greater when a migrant's remittance obligations are high. Providing information about urban earnings increases migration to the capital city by about 40 percent over two years.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210571
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Returns to International Migration: Evidence from a Bangladesh-Malaysia Visa Lottery,"Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, Iffath Sharif and Maheshwor Shrestha","South Asians traveling to richer Asian nations is the world's largest migration corridor. We track down applicants to a government lottery that randomly allocated visas to Bangladeshis for temporary labor contracts in Malaysia, five years later. Most lottery winners migrate, and migrants' earnings triple. Their remittance raises their family's standard of living in Bangladesh. The migrant's absence pauses marriage and childbirth and shifts decision-making power toward females. Migration removes enterprising individuals, lowering household entrepreneurship, but does not crowd out other family members' labor supply. A deferred migration offer never materialized for a subgroup. Their premigration investments in skills generate no returns in the domestic market.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220258
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Civil Liberties in Times of Crisis,"Marcella Alsan, Luca Braghieri, Sarah Eichmeyer, Minjeong Joyce Kim, Stefanie Stantcheva and David Yang","We study people's willingness to trade off civil liberties for increased health security in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by deploying representative surveys involving around 550,000 responses across 15 countries. We document significant heterogeneity across groups in willingness to sacrifice rights: citizens disadvantaged by income, education, or race are less willing to sacrifice rights than their more advantaged peers in every country. Leveraging naturally occurring variation and experimental approaches, we estimate a one standard deviation increase in health insecurity increases willingness to sacrifice civil liberties by 68–83 percent of the difference between the average Chinese and US citizen.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210736
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Discrimination in Times of Crises and the Role of the Media,Asaf Zussman,"Can the extent of ethnic discrimination change quickly, and what circumstances and mechanisms make such changes possible? I address these questions by using scraped data to study the daily evolution of customer discrimination against Arab doctors in Israel from January 2020 to June 2021. Results show that: (1) the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis in March 2020 led to a dramatic decline in discrimination; (2) the eruption of a wave of ethnic riots in May 2021 had the opposite effect; (3) media coverage of the contribution of Arab doctors to the fight against the pandemic helped bring about the first change.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210732
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Physical Disability and Labor Market Discrimination: Evidence from a Video Résumé Field Experiment,"Charles Bellemare, Marion Goussé, Guy Lacroix and Steeve Marchand","We sent fictitious applications to firms advertising job openings. We find that revealing a disability decreases callback rates by 25 percentage points. This result is not explained by accessibility constraints or lower productivity due to disability. We find that including a video résumé of a well-spoken applicant significantly increases callbacks by 10 percentage points for persons with and without disabilities, suggesting that discrimination is unaffected by quality signals in our context. Analysis of viewing activity suggests that employers seek less information when the applicant is disabled. Disclosing the disability later in the video increases employers' viewing time but leaves callback rates unchanged.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210633
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,The Effect of Hospital Postpartum Care Regulations on Breastfeeding and Maternal Time Allocation,Emily C. Lawler and Katherine G. Yewell,"We study the effects of state hospital regulations intended to increase breastfeeding by requiring certain standards of care during the immediate postpartum hospital stay. We find that these regulations significantly increased breastfeeding initiation by 3.8 percentage points (5.1 percent) and the probability of breastfeeding at 3 and 6 months postpartum by approximately 7 percent. We also provide evidence that these breastfeeding-promoting policies significantly increased maternal time spent on child care, crowding out time spent on formal work. Observed reductions in employment are concentrated among mothers with infants between zero and three months of age.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220201
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,When Sarah Meets Lawrence: The Effects of Coeducation on Women's College Major Choices,"Avery Calkins, Ariel Binder, Dana Shaat and Brenden Timpe","We leverage variation in the adoption of coeducation by US women's colleges to study how exposure to a mixed-gender collegiate environment affects women's human capital investments. Our event-study analyses of newly collected historical data find a 3.0–3.5 percentage point (30–33 percent) decline in the share of women majoring in STEM fields. While coeducation caused a large influx of male peers and a modest increase in male faculty, we find no evidence that it altered the composition of the female student body or other gender-neutral inputs. Extrapolation of our main estimate suggests that coeducational environments explain 36 percent of the current gender gap in STEM majors.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210692
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Uncovering Peer Effects in Social and Academic Skills,Román Andrés Zárate,"This paper studies the impact of adolescent peers who are central in their social network on the formation of social skills and academic performance of fellow students. I conduct a novel large-scale field experiment at selective public boarding schools in Peru with two treatments: (i) more socially central versus less socially central peers, and (ii) higher-achieving versus lower-achieving peers. Peer effects are more pronounced for social skills than academic performance, and both vary by gender. While socially central peers lead boys to better social skills, higher-achieving peers decrease girls' test scores. Gender differences in self-confidence can explain both findings.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210583
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Does Discipline Decrease Police Misconduct? Evidence from Chicago Civilian Allegations,Kyle Rozema and Max Schanzenbach,"Reformers are calling for greater oversight of police behavior, in part through enhanced use of civilian complaints. However, others counter that greater oversight could chill effective policing. We assess police officer response to administrative determinations of misconduct. Using Chicago data, we find strong evidence that a sustained allegation reduces that officer's future misconduct. We find no evidence that this effect is driven by incapacitation, such as assignment to desk duty, or by officer disengagement. We conclude that our findings are most consistent with improved officer conduct, in part from oversight and officer concerns over promotion, salary, and desirable assignments.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200568
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Halfway Home? Residential Housing and Reincarceration,Logan M. Lee,"Every year, hundreds of thousands of people are released from prison. For many, the transition back to society includes a mandatory stay in residential housing. I estimate the effect of residential housing on reincarceration using administrative data from Iowa. I address selection into residential housing by instrumenting for residential housing assignment with the recommendation rate of randomly assigned case managers. I find no evidence that Iowa's costly investment in residential housing results in reduced reincarceration relative to parole. Instead, residential housing increases reincarceration due to violent crimes and technical violations, while decreasing drug and public order crimes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200150
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Does Cash Bail Deter Misconduct?,Aurélie Ouss and Megan Stevenson,"Courts routinely use low cash bail as a financial incentive to ensure released defendants appear in court and abstain from crime. This can create burdens for defendants with little empirical evidence on its efficacy. We exploit a prosecutor-driven reform that led to a sharp reduction in low cash bail and pretrial supervision, with no effect on pretrial detention, to test whether such incentive mechanisms succeed at their intended purpose. We find no evidence that financial collateral has a deterrent effect on failure to appear or pretrial crime. This paper also contributes to the literature on legal actor discretion, showing that nonbinding reforms may have limited impact on jail populations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210349
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,When Do Politicians Appeal Broadly? The Economic Consequences of Electoral Rules in Brazil,Moya Chin,"Electoral rules determine how voters' preferences are aggregated and translated into political representation. Using a regression discontinuity design, I contrast single- and two-round elections in Brazil. In two-round elections, the eventual winner must obtain at least 50 percent of the vote. I show that two-round elections provide incentives for candidates to secure a broader base of support and provide public goods more broadly. Candidates represent a more geographically diverse group of voters, public schools have more resources, and there is less variation in resources across schools. Effects appear to be driven by strategic responses of candidates rather than differential entry into races.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210529
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,School Attendance Boundaries and the Segregation of Public Schools in the United States,Tomás E. Monarrez,"School segregation is determined both by residential sorting and local policies, such as the drawing of attendance boundaries and school siting. This paper develops an approach to understanding the relative importance of these factors by calculating the distance-minimizing assignment of students to schools and assessing whether actual assignments differ systematically by race. Using census data and attendance boundary maps for nearly 1,600 school districts, I find that attendance boundaries create 5 percent more integration than a distance-minimizing baseline, while school siting plays almost no role. Residential segregation alone explains more than 100 percent of school segregation in the United States.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200498
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Working Their Way Up? US Immigrants' Changing Labor Market Assimilation in the Age of Mass Migration,William J. Collins and Ariell Zimran,"Whether immigrants advance in labor markets during their life- times relative to natives is a fundamental question in the economics of immigration. We examine linked census records for five cohorts spanning 1850–1940, when immigration to the United States was at its peak. We find a U-shaped pattern of assimilation: immigrants were ""catching up"" to natives in the early and later cohorts, but not in between. This change was not due to shifts in immigrants' source countries. Instead, it was rooted in men's early-career occupations, which we associate with structural change, strengthening complementarities, and large immigration waves in the 1840s and 1900s.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210008
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,From Hashtag to Hate Crime: Twitter and Antiminority Sentiment,Karsten Müller and Carlo Schwarz,"We study whether social media can amplify antiminority sentiment with a focus on Donald Trump's political rise. Using an instrumental variable strategy based on Twitter's early adopters at the South by Southwest festival in 2007, we find that higher Twitter use in a county is associated with a sizeable increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes after the 2016 presidential primaries. Trump's tweets about Muslims predict increases in xenophobic tweets by his followers, cable news mentions of Muslims, and hate crimes on the following days. These results suggest that social media content can affect real-life outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210211
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Adverse Selection in Low-Income Health Insurance Markets: Evidence from an RCT in Pakistan,"Torben Fischer, Markus Frölich and Andreas Landmann","We present robust evidence on adverse selection in hospitalization insurance for low-income individuals that received first-time access to insurance. A large randomized control trial from Pakistan allows us to separate adverse selection from moral hazard, estimate how selection changes at different points of the demand curve, and test simple measures to limit adverse selection. The results reveal substantial selection in individual policies, leading to welfare losses and the threat of a market breakdown. Bundling insurance policies at the household level or higher almost eliminates adverse selection, thus mitigating its welfare consequences and facilitating sustainable insurance supply.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200639
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,What Difference Does a Health Plan Make? Evidence from Random Plan Assignment in Medicaid,"Michael Geruso, Timothy Layton and Jacob Wallace","Exploiting the random assignment of Medicaid beneficiaries to managed care plans, we find substantial plan-specific spending effects despite plans having identical cost sharing. Enrollment in the lowest-spending plan reduces spending by at least 25 percent—primarily through quantity reductions—relative to enrollment in the highest-spending plan. Rather than reducing ""wasteful"" spending, lower-spending plans broadly reduce medical service provision—including the provision of low-cost, high-value care—and worsen beneficiary satisfaction and health. Consumer demand follows spending: a 10 percent increase in plan-specific spending is associated with a 40 percent increase in market share. These facts have implications for the government's contracting problem and program cost growth.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210843
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Generic Aversion and Observational Learning in the Over-the-Counter Drug Market,Mariana Carrera and Sofia Villas-Boas,"Through a labeling intervention at a national retailer, we test three hypotheses for consumer aversion to generic over-the-counter drugs: lack of information on the comparability of generic and brand drugs, inattention to their price differences, and uncertainty about generic quality that can be reduced with information on peer purchase rates. With a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that posted information on the purchases of other customers increases generic purchase shares significantly, while other treatments have mixed results. Consumers without prior generic purchases appear particularly responsive to this information. These findings have policy implications for promoting evidence-based, cost-effective choices.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200867
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Infrastructure Costs,Leah Brooks and Zachary Liscow,"Despite infrastructure's importance to the US economy, evidence on its cost trajectory over time is sparse. We document real spending per new mile over the history of the Interstate Highway System. We find that spending per mile increased more than threefold from the 1960s to the 1980s. This increase persists even conditional on pre-existing observable geographic cost determinants. We then provide suggestive evidence on why. Input prices explain little of the increase. Statistically, changes in income and housing prices explain about half of the increase. We find suggestive evidence that the rise of ""citizen voice"" in government decision-making increased spending per mile.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200398
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Discriminatory Lending: Evidence from Bankers in the Lab,J. Michelle Brock and Ralph De Haas,"We implement a lab-in-the-field experiment with 334 Turkish loan officers to document gender discrimination in small business lending and unpack mechanisms. Officers review multiple real-life loan applications in which we randomize applicant gender. While unconditional approval rates are the same, officers are 26 percent more likely to require a guarantor when we present the same application as coming from a female instead of a male entrepreneur. A causal forest algorithm to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects reveals that discrimination is concentrated among young, inexperienced, and gender-biased officers. Discrimination mainly affects female loan applicants in male-dominated industries, indicating how financial frictions can perpetuate entrepreneurial gender segregation across sectors.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210180
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Income Segregation and the Rise of the Knowledge Economy,Enrico Berkes and Ruben Gaetani,"We analyze the effect of an increase in knowledge-intensive activities on spatial inequality in US cities. We leverage a predetermined network of patent citations to instrument for local innovation trends. Between 1990 and 2010, a one-standard-deviation increase in patent growth increases income segregation by 0.65 Gini points, corresponding to 0.31 standard deviations of the over-time change in income segregation. This effect mainly arises from the sorting of residents by income, occupation, and education. Local shocks to innovation induce a clustering of knowledge-intensive jobs and residents, amplified by the response of rents and amenities.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210074

Expert Forecasts and Field Experimental Evidence,Anya Samek and Chuck Longfield,"Calling to thank donors is considered a key fundraising strategy in the charitable giving industry. Yet the effectiveness of thank-you calls remains untested. We conduct field experiments with public television stations and a national nonprofit in which 500,000 new donors were randomized to receive a thank-you call or not. Fundraising professionals predicted that the calls—which followed standard practices in the industry—would increase donor retention by 80 percent.

DETER is a system that processes satellite imagery and issues near-real-time deforestation alerts to target environmental enforcement in the Amazon. We propose a novel instrumental variable approach for estimating enforcement's impact on deforestation. Clouds limiting DETER's capacity to detect clearings serve as a source of exogenous variation for the presence of environmental authorities. Findings indicate that monitoring and enforcement effectively curb deforestation. Results hold across several robustness checks.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200196

We identify exogenous variation in emigration from Italy by interacting past diaspora networks and current economic pull factors in destination countries. We find that a 1 standard deviation increase in the emigration rate generates a 4.8 percent decline in firms' creation in the local labor market of origin. An accounting exercise decomposes the estimated effect into four components: subtraction of individuals with average entrepreneurial propensity, selection of young and college-educated among emigrants, negative spillovers on firm creation, and selection on unobservable characteristics positively associated with entrepreneurship.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210194

Treated firms experienced increases in firm size of approximately half a worker and firm profits of approximately 10 percent for each apprentice placement offered, documenting frictions to novice hiring.

Our results confirm the theoretical prediction that WFH puts downward pressure on housing prices and rents in high-productivity counties, a result of workers starting to relocate to cheaper metro areas during the pandemic without forsaking their desirable jobs.

Their shared etiological pathways present a case of compounding health risk via interacting externalities. Using instrumental variables based on changing wind direction, we show that increased levels of contemporaneous pollution increase influenza hospitalizations. We exploit random variation in effectiveness of the influenza vaccine as an additional instrument to show that vaccine protection neutralizes this relationship. Thus, pollution control and vaccination campaigns jointly provide greater returns than those implied by addressing either in isolation.

AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Tax Refund Uncertainty: Evidence and Welfare Implications,"Sydnee Caldwell, Scott Nelson and Daniel Waldinger","Transfers paid through annual tax refunds are a large but uncertain source of income for poor households. We document that low-income tax filers have substantial subjective uncertainty about these refunds. We investigate the determinants and consequences of refund uncertainty by linking survey, tax, and credit bureau data. On average, filers' expectations track realized refunds. More uncertain filers have larger differences between expected and realized refunds. Filers borrow in anticipation of their refunds, but more uncertain filers borrow less, consistent with precautionary behavior. A simple consumption-savings model suggests that refund uncertainty reduces the welfare benefits of the EITC by about 10 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210383
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Energy Saving May Kill: Evidence from the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,Guojun He and Takanao Tanaka,"Following the Fukushima nuclear accident, Japan gradually shut down all its nuclear power plants, causing a countrywide power shortage. In response the government launched large-scale energy-saving campaigns to reduce electricity consumption. Exploiting the electricity-saving targets across regions and over time, we show that the campaigns significantly increased mortality, particularly during extremely hot days. The impact is primarily driven by people using less air conditioning, as encouraged by the government. Nonpecuniary incentives can explain most of the reduction in electricity consumption.

AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,The Impact of Income-Driven Repayment on Student Borrower Outcomes,Daniel Herbst,"In the United States, most student loans follow a fixed payment schedule that falls early in borrowers' careers. This structure provides no insurance against earnings risk and may increase student loan defaults. Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are designed to help distressed student borrowers by lowering their monthly payments to a share of income. Using random variation in a loan servicer's automatic dialing system, I find that IDR reduces delinquencies by 22 percentage points and decreases outstanding balances within eight months of take-up.

For highly ranked students at more disadvantaged high schools, who gained access under the policy, college enrollment and graduation increased. Less highly ranked students at more advantaged schools, who tended to lose access, shifted toward less-selective colleges under the policy, but did not see declines in overall college enrollment, graduation, or earnings. The policy thus benefited students targeted for admission without evidence of adverse effects on displaced students.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200137
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,A Glimpse of Freedom: Allied Occupation and Political Resistance in East Germany,"Luis Martinez, Jonas Jessen and Guo Xu","This paper exploits the idiosyncratic line of contact separating Allied and Soviet troops within East Germany at the end of WWII to study political resistance in a non-democracy. When Nazi Germany surrendered, 40 percent of what would become the authoritarian German Democratic Republic was initially under Allied control but was ceded to Soviet control less than two months later. Brief Allied exposure increased protests during the major 1953 uprising. We use novel data on the appointment of local mayors and a retrospective survey to argue that even a ""glimpse of freedom"" can foster civilian opposition to dictatorship.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200456
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Employer Responses to Family Leave Programs,"Rita Ginja, Arizo Karimi and Pengpeng Xiao","Search frictions make worker turnover costly to firms. A three-month parental leave expansion in Sweden provides exogenous variation that we use to quantify firms' adjustment costs upon worker absence. The reform increased women's leave duration and likelihood of separating from pre-birth employers. Firms with greater exposure to the reform hired additional workers and increased coworkers to make it coworkers' hours, incurring wage costs corresponding to 10 full-time equivalent months in addition to replacing the workers. These adjustment costs varied by firms' availability of internal substitutes. We also analyze a daddy-month reform and find similar employer responses to male workers' leave, albeit smaller in magnitude.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200448
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Labor Supply and Directed Technical Change: Evidence from the Termination of the Bracero Program in 1964,Shmuel San,"This paper studies the impact of labor supply on the creation of new technology, exploiting a large exogenous shock to the US agricultural labor supply caused by the termination of the Bracero agreements between the US and Mexico at the end of 1964. Using a text-search algorithm allocating patents to crops, I show a negative labor-supply shock induced a sharp increase in innovation in technologies related to more affected crops. The effect is stronger for technology related to labor-intensive production tasks. Farm-value dynamics indicate that, despite the positive technology reaction, the policy change was undesirable for farm owners.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200664
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,The Effect of Immigration Restrictions on Local Labor Markets: Lessons from the 1920s Border Closure,"Ran Abramitzky, Philipp Ager, Leah Boustan, Elior Cohen and Casper Hansen","In the 1920s, the United States substantially reduced immigration by imposing country-specific entry quotas. We compare local labor markets differentially exposed to the quotas due to variation in the national-origin mix of their immigrant population. US-born workers in areas losing immigrants did not benefit relative to workers in less exposed areas. Instead, in urban areas, European immigrants were replaced with internal migrants and immigrants from Mexico and Canada. By contrast, farmers shifted toward capital-intensive agriculture, and the immigrant-intensive mining industry contracted. These differences highlight the uneven effects of the quota system at the local level.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200807
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,"Temperature, Worker Productivity, and Adaptation: Evidence from Survey Data Production",Melissa LoPalo,"This paper estimates the impact of daily weather on worker productivity by using household survey data to study interviewers. Using data from over 9,000 Demographic and Health Surveys interviewers in 46 countries, I find that interviewers complete 13.6 percent fewer interviews per hour on the hottest and most humid days. Workers maintain the same total output by starting earlier in the day and spending more time on each interview at the expense of spending more hours in the field with the same total pay. In addition, interviewers become differentially less productive on tasks that are less easily monitored.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200547
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Every Day Is Earth Day: Evidence on the Long-Term Impact of Environmental Activism,Daniel Hungerman and Vivek Moorthy,"We use variation in weather to study the long-term effects of activism during the original Earth Day on attitudes, environmental outcomes, and children's health. Unusually bad weather on April 22, 1970 is associated with weaker support for the environment 10 to 20 years later, particularly among those who were school aged in 1970. Bad weather on Earth Day is also associated with higher levels of carbon monoxide in the air and greater risk of congenital abnormalities in infants born in the following decades. These results identify benefits to volunteer activity that would be impossible to identify until years after the volunteering occurs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210045
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Incentivized Peer Referrals for Tuberculosis Screening: Evidence from India,"Jessica Goldberg, Mario Macis and Pradeep Chintagunta","We study whether and how peer referrals increase screening, testing, and identification of patients with tuberculosis, an infectious disease responsible for over one million deaths annually. In an experiment with 3,176 patients at 122 tuberculosis treatment centers in India, we find that small financial incentives raise the probability that existing patients refer prospective patients for screening and testing, resulting in cost-effective identification of new cases. Incentivized referrals operate through two mechanisms: peers have private information about individuals in their social networks to target for outreach, and they are more effective than health workers in inducing these individuals to get tested.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200721
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Strategic Formal Layoffs: Unemployment Insurance and Informal Labor Markets,"Bernardus Van Doornik, David Schoenherr and Janis Skrastins","Exploiting an unemployment insurance reform in Brazil, we study incentive effects of UI in the presence of informal labor markets. We find that eligibility for UI benefits increases formal layoffs by 11 percent. Most of the additional layoffs are related to workers transitioning to informal employment. We further document formal layoff and recall patterns consistent with rent extraction from the UI system. Workers are laid off as they become eligible for UI benefits and recalled when benefits cease. These patterns are stronger for industries and municipalities with a high degree of labor market informality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200787
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,Inefficient Water Pricing and Incentives for Conservation,"Ujjayant Chakravorty, Manzoor H. Dar and Kyle Emerick","Farmers often buy water using fixed fees—rather than with marginal prices. We use two randomized controlled trials in Bangladesh to study the relationship between marginal prices, adoption of a water-saving technology, and water usage. Our first experiment shows that the technology only saves water when farmers face marginal prices. Our second experiment finds that an encouragement to voluntarily convert to hourly pumping charges does not save water. Taken together, efforts to conserve water work best when farmers face marginal prices, but simply giving an option for marginal pricing is insufficient to trigger water-saving investments and reduce irrigation demands.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210011
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,High School Majors and Future Earnings,"Gordon Dahl, Dan-Olof Rooth and Anders Stenberg","We study how high school majors affect adult earnings using a regression discontinuity design. In Sweden students are admitted to majors in tenth grade based on their preference rankings and ninth grade GPA. We find engineering, natural science, and business majors yield higher earnings than social science and humanities, with major-specific returns also varying based on next-best alternatives. There is either a zero or a negative return to completing an academic program for students with a second-best nonacademic major. Most of the differences in adult earnings can be attributed to differences in occupation, and to a lesser extent, college major.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210292
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,The Effects of Working While in School: Evidence from Employment Lotteries,"Thomas Le Barbanchon, Diego Ubfal and Federico Araya","Does working while in school smooth students' transition into the labor market? We provide evidence on this question by leveraging a one-year work-study program that randomized job offers among over 90,000 student applicants in Uruguay. Program rules forbade employers from employing participants in the same job after program completion, and less than 5 percent of participants ever worked in the same firm again. Two years after the program, participants had 8 percent higher earnings. Our results suggest that the program's focus on work-related skills was a key mechanism for earnings impacts.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210041
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,The Employee Costs of Corporate Debarment in Public Procurement,Christiane Szerman,"This paper studies an anticorruption policy—corporate debarment, or blacklisting—to understand how disclosing illicit corporate practices and the sanctions for these practices affect firm and worker outcomes. Exploiting a policy change in Brazil that imposed stricter penalties for corrupt firms, I find that debarment is associated with a sizable decline in employment and an increase in the probability of exiting the formal sector. I also document that workers' annual earnings fall after debarment. The impacts are driven by lost revenues from government contracts. The results shed light on the costs to workers in weighing the consequences of corruption crackdown.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200669
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,The Economic Incidence of Wildfire Suppression in the United States,Patrick Baylis and Judson Boomhower,"This study measures the degree to which public expenditures on wildfire protection subsidize development in harm's way. We use administrative data on firefighting expenditures to measure the causal effect of nearby homes on the amount spent to extinguish wildfires. We use these estimates in an actuarial calculation yielding geographically differentiated expected implicit subsidies for homes across the western United States. The expected net present value of this subsidy can exceed 20 percent of home value, increases with fire hazard, and decreases surprisingly steeply with development density. We discuss potential behavioral responses by individuals and local governments using a simple economic model.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200662
AEJ: Applied Economics,2023,"Wage Stagnation and the Decline of Standardized Pay Rates, 1974–1991",Maxim Massenkoff and Nathan Wilmers,"Using new establishment-by-occupation microdata, we show that the use of discretionary wage setting significantly expanded in the 1970s and 1980s. Increasingly, wages for blue-collar workers were not standardized by job title or seniority but instead subject to managerial discretion. When establishments abandoned standardized pay rates, wages fell, particularly for the lowest-paid workers in a job and for those in establishments that previously paid above market rates. This shift away from standardized pay rates, in context of a broader decline in worker bargaining power, accelerated the decline in real wages experienced by blue-collar workers in the 1980s.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200819
