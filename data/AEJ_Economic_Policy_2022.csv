AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Optimal Regulation of E-cigarettes: Theory and Evidence,Hunt Allcott and Charlie Rafkin,"We model optimal e-cigarette regulation and estimate key parameters. Using tax changes and scanner data, we estimate relatively elastic demand. A demographic shift-share identification strategy suggests limited substitution between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. We field a new survey of public health experts who report that vaping is more harmful than previously believed. In our model's average Monte Carlo simulation, these results imply optimal e-cigarette taxes are higher than recent norms. However, e-cigarette subsidies may be optimal if vaping is a stronger substitute for smoking and is safer than our experts report, or if consumers overestimate the health harms from vaping.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200805
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,"Hungry for Success? SNAP Timing, High-Stakes Exam Performance, and College Attendance","Timothy Bond, Jillian Carr, Analisa Packham and Jonathan Smith","Monthly government transfer programs create cycles of consumption that track the timing of benefit receipt. If these cycles correspond to critical moments for student learning and achievement, the timing of transfers may have important long-run implications for low-income students. In this paper we exploit state-level variation in the staggered timing of nutritional assistance benefit issuance to analyze effects on academic achievement. Using individual-level data from a large national college admission exam, we find taking this high-stakes exam during the last two weeks of the SNAP benefit cycle reduces test scores and lowers the probability of attending a four-year college.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210026
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,"Do Two Electricity Pricing Wrongs Make a Right? Cost Recovery, Externalities, and Efficiency",Severin Borenstein and James Bushnell,"Economists favor pricing pollution in part so that consumers face the full social marginal cost (SMC) of goods and services. But even absent externalities, retail electricity prices typically exceed private marginal cost, due to a utility's need to cover average costs. Furthermore, the SMC of electricity can fluctuate widely hour-to-hour, while retail prices do not. We show that residential electricity rates exceed average SMC in most of the US, but there is large geographic and temporal variation. This finding has important implications for pass-through of pollution costs, as well as for policies promoting dynamic pricing, alternative energy, and reduced electricity consumption.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190758
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Behavioral Responses to Wealth Taxes: Evidence from Switzerland,"Marius Brülhart, Jonathan Gruber, Matthias Krapf and Kurt Schmidheiny","We study how declared wealth responds to changes in wealth tax rates. Exploiting rich intranational variation in Switzerland, we find a 1 percentage point drop in a canton's wealth tax rate raises reported taxable wealth by at least 43 percent after 6 years. Administrative tax records of two cantons with quasi-randomly assigned differential tax reforms suggest that 24 percent of the effect arises from taxpayer mobility and 21 percent from a concurrent rise in housing prices. Savings responses appear unable to explain more than a small fraction of the remainder, suggesting sizable evasion responses in this setting with no third-party reporting of financial wealth.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200258
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Adviser Value Added and Student Outcomes: Evidence from Randomly Assigned College Advisers,"Serena Canaan, Antoine Deeb and Pierre Mouganie","This paper provides the first causal evidence on the impact of college advisor quality on student outcomes. To do so, we exploit a unique setting where students are randomly assigned to faculty advisors during their first year of college. We find that higher advisor value added (VA) substantially improves freshman year GPA, time to complete freshman year and four-year graduation rates. Additionally, higher advisor VA increases high-ability students' likelihood of enrolling and graduating with a STEM degree. Our results indicate that allocating resources towards improving the quality of academic advising may play a key role in promoting college success.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200778
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Hazards of Unwinding the Prescription Opioid Epidemic: Implications for Child Maltreatment,"Mary Evans, Matthew Harris and Lawrence M. Kessler","Child maltreatment has significant and long-lasting consequences. We examine how two interventions designed to curtail prescription opioid misuse, the reformulation of OxyContin and the implementation of must-access prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), affected child maltreatment. Our results suggest counties with greater initial rates of prescription opioid usage experienced relatively larger increases in child physical abuse and neglect after OxyContin's reformulation. We also find some evidence of increases in alleged physical abuse and neglect due to must-access PDMP implementation. Our results uncover unintended consequences for children of reducing the supply of an addictive good without adequate support for dependent users.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200301

To investigate the latter, we conducted a two-year, face-to-face survey experiment on a representative sample of Germans. We measure how individuals form perceptions of their ranks in the national and global income distributions and how these perceptions relate to their national and global policy preferences. We find that Germans systematically underestimate their true place in the world's income distribution but that correcting those misperceptions does not affect their support for policies related to global inequality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200343

Levitt, John List and Sally Sadoff","In a field experiment, we provide financial incentives to teachers framed either as gains, received at the end of the year, or as losses, in which teachers receive up-front bonuses that must be paid back if their students do not improve sufficiently. Pooling two waves of the experiment, loss-framed incentives improve math achievement by an estimated 0.124 standard deviations (σ), with large effects in the first wave and no effects in the second wave. Effects for gain-framed incentives are smaller and not statistically significant, approximately 0.051σ.

Black teachers have no significant long-run effects on White students. Postsecondary education results are driven by two-year colleges and concentrated among disadvantaged males.

Schneider","We investigate heterogeneity in responsiveness to reminder letters among New York City parking ticket recipients. Using variation in the timing of letters, we find a strong aggregate response. But we find large differences across individuals: those with a low baseline propensity to respond to tickets—a natural nudge target—react least to letters. These low-response types, who incur significant late penalties, disproportionately come from already disadvantaged groups. They do react strongly to traditional, incentive-based interventions. We discuss how accounting for response heterogeneity might change one's approach to policy and how one might use our analysis to target interventions at low-response types.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200400
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Multinationals' Sales and Profit Shifting in Tax Havens,Sébastien Laffitte and Farid Toubal,"We show that US multinationals record sales and the profits from these sales in tax havens while their goods and services are physically sold in other countries. We propose a framework illustrating the strategy of sales shifting. Our results reveal the importance of tax havens, which attract a disproportionate fraction of worldwide sales. Our quantification shows a large contribution of sales shifting to multinationals' profit shifting, which amounted to $80 billion in 2013. Our findings suggest that international corporate tax rules based on sales may not address profit shifting efficiently if the policy designs are unable to identify sales by destination.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200203
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Health Care Rationing in Public Insurance Programs: Evidence from Medicaid,"Timothy Layton, Nicole Maestas, Daniel Prinz and Boris Vabson","We study two mechanisms used by public health insurance programs for rationing health care: outsourcing to private managed care plans and quantity limits for prescription drugs. Leveraging a natural experiment in Texas's Medicaid program, we find that the shift to managed care and the relaxation of a strict drug cap increased access to high-value drugs and outpatient services and reduced avoidable hospitalizations. Program costs increased significantly, indicating a trade-off between cost and quality. We provide suggestive evidence attributing the reduction in hospitalizations to the relaxation of the drug cap and much of the spending increase to the shift to managed care.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190628
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Can Nudges Increase Take-Up of the EITC? Evidence from Multiple Field Experiments,"Elizabeth Linos, Allen Prohofsky, Aparna Ramesh, Jesse Rothstein and Matthew Unrath","The Earned Income Tax Credit distributes more than $60 billion to over 20 million low-income families annually. Nevertheless, an estimated one-fifth of eligible households do not claim it. We ran six preregistered, large-scale field experiments with 1 million observations to test whether ""nudges"" could increase EITC take-up. Despite varying the content, design, messenger, and mode of our messages, we find no evidence that they affected households' likelihood of filing a tax return or claiming the credit. We conclude that even the most behaviorally informed low-touch outreach efforts cannot overcome the barriers faced by low-income households who do not file returns.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200603
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Mandatory Energy Efficiency Disclosure in Housing Markets,"Erica Myers, Steven L. Puller and Jeremy West","Mandatory disclosure policies are implemented broadly despite sparse evidence that they improve market outcomes. We study the effects of requiring home sellers to provide buyers with certified audits of residential energy efficiency. Using similar nearby homes as a comparison group, we find that this requirement increases price premiums for energy efficiency and encourages energy-saving investments. We additionally present evidence highlighting the market failure—incomplete information by both buyers and sellers—that prevents widespread voluntary disclosure of energy efficiency in housing transactions. Our findings support that disclosure policies can improve market outcomes in settings with symmetrically incomplete information.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200539
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Old-Age Security Motive for Fertility: Evidence from the Extension of Social Pensions in Namibia,Pauline Rossi and Mathilde Godard,"The old-age security motive for fertility postulates that people's needs for old-age support raise the demand for children. We exploit the extension of social pensions in Namibia during the 1990s to provide a quasi-experimental quantification of this widespread idea. The reform eliminated inequalities in pension coverage and benefits across regions and ethnic groups. Combining differences in pre-reform pensions and differences in exposure across cohorts, we show that pensions substantially reduce fertility, especially in late reproductive life. The results suggest that improving social protection for the elderly could go a long way in fostering fertility decline in sub-Saharan Africa.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200466
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Gerrymandering in State Legislatures: Frictions from Axiomatic Bargaining,Hisam Sabouni and Cameron A. Shelton,"Theories of partisan redistricting postulate unitary actors maximizing their party's expected seat share. Yet, the partition of a fixed supply of friendly voters necessarily implies a tragedy of the commons. We recast partisan redistricting as a bargaining game among the sitting representatives of the party controlling the map. The status quo is the threat point, explaining why changes are frequently minor. This bargaining framework implies that highly competitive districts will receive more help from redistricting if they are already represented by the party in charge. Employing a regression discontinuity design with precinct-level data, we find support for this prediction.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190213
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Housing Lock: Dutch Evidence on the Impact of Negative Home Equity on Household Mobility,Asaf Bernstein and Daan Struyven,"This paper employs Dutch administrative population data to test the ""housing lock hypothesis"": the conjecture that homeowners with negative home equity, low levels of financial assets, and restricted opportunities to borrow reduce their mobility. Variation in home equity driven by the timing of home purchase within a municipality and the harshness of Dutch recourse laws facilitates identification of housing lock effects. The 2SLS estimate for the effect of negative home equity is a 74–79 percent decline in mobility, where effects are substantially larger for households with low financial asset holdings or moves over longer distances.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20150252
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Political Parties Do Matter in US Cities... for Their Unfunded Pensions,Christian Dippel,"This paper studies public sector pension obligations, the biggest fiscal challenge currently facing many US cities. Employing a regression discontinuity design around close elections, benefit payments out of a city's public sector pensions are shown to grow faster under Democratic party mayors, while contributions into the pensions do not. Previous research showed that parties do not matter for a wide range of cities' fiscal expenditures and explained this with voters imposing fiscal discipline. This paper replicates previous results but shows that parties can matter for shrouded expenditure types that voters do not pay attention to, especially if they benefit well-organized interest groups.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190480

A randomly selected subgroup was also presented with fact-checking of these statements; another subgroup was offered a choice of whether to view the fact-checking. Participants could then share these statements on their Facebook pages. We show that (i) both imposed and voluntary fact-checking reduce sharing of false statements by about 45 percent, (ii) the size of the effect is similar between imposed and voluntary fact-checking, and (iii) each additional click required to share false statements substantially reduces sharing.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210037
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Human Trafficking and Regulating Prostitution,Samuel Lee and Petra Persson,"Certain markets are illicit because part of the supply is coerced, but little is known about the optimal regulation of such markets. We model a prostitution market with voluntary and coerced prostitutes and ask what regulation can restore the benchmark outcome that would arise under laissez-faire absent coercion. Whereas current policies—decriminalization, criminalization of the buy or sell sides, and licensing—are ineffective against trafficking or harm voluntary suppliers, we show that an alternative policy can restore the benchmark outcome. Our results are relevant to the ongoing debate about decriminalizing prostitution and provide guidance for empirical work on prostitution regulation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180622

While small-scale experiments change behaviors among adults in the short run, we know little about the effectiveness of large-scale policies or the longer-run impacts. To nudge primary school children into a long-term habit of exercising, the German state of Saxony distributed sports club membership vouchers among all 33,000 third graders in 2009. In 2018, we carried out a register-based survey to evaluate the policy. Even after a decade, awareness of the voucher program was significantly higher in the treatment group. We also find that youth received and redeemed the vouchers. However, we do not find significant short- or long-term effects on sports club membership, physical activity, overweightness, or motor skills. Apparently, membership vouchers for children are not a strong enough policy tool to overcome barriers to exercise regularly.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200431
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,"Centralized Admissions, Affirmative Action, and Access of Low-Income Students to Higher Education",Ursula Mello,"I analyze how two reforms, introduced to expand college access in Brazil, impacted enrollments of low-SES students. The first policy centralized applications in a nationwide platform (SISU), and the second expanded affirmative action quotas (AA) to a uniform share of 50 percent of vacancies offered by degree. Results show that SISU changes enrollment decisions of high-SES students, crowding out low-SES groups from the least competitive degrees disproportionately. In contrast, AA increases enrollments of low-SES individuals not only mechanically but also through behavioral responses. Finally, their interaction creates a complementary effect, protecting the low-SES groups from the crowding-out of centralization.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190639

Evidence from a Random-Assignment College Access Field Experiment,Meredith Phillips and Sarah Reber,"Although in-person college access programs can be effective, less is known about whether low-cost and scalable virtual interventions can achieve the same benefits. We evaluate two variants of a virtual college counseling program. Students randomly assigned to the program felt more supported applying to college and applied more broadly to four-year colleges, but were not more likely to be accepted or enroll. We analyze rich and extensive survey data to explore mechanisms and why the program did not improve college enrollment.

Naïve OLS estimates suggest that returns to subsidized housing participation are negative, but that relationship is driven by household selection into assisted housing. Household fixed effects estimates indicate that additional years of public housing increase earnings by 6.2 percent for females and 6.1 percent for males, while voucher-assisted housing increases earnings by 4.8 percent for females and 2.7 percent for males.

Children in these households were eligible for Medicaid irrespective of the lottery outcome. We estimate statistically significant but transitory impacts of adult lottery selection on child Medicaid enrollment: at three months after the lottery, for every nine adults who enrolled in Medicaid due to winning the lottery, one additional child also enrolled.

Using data rich in both the charity space and time dimensions, we find that major fundraising appeals lift donations to the appeal charity and that this increase is not offset by lower donations later in time. Strikingly, major appeals also forward-shift donations to other (nonappeal) charities that are offset by lower donations later. To understand these response patterns, we introduce a two-period, two-charity ""lift-shift"" model. The model indicates that the observed response patterns are possible only if warm glow is substitutable, both intertemporally and between charities.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180679

We compare current demographic and economic characteristics of Science Cities with those of localities that were similar to them at the time of their establishment. We find that in present-day Russia, Science Cities are more innovative and productive, host more highly skilled workers, and pay them higher salaries.

I find that willingness to pay is remarkably low. In high-risk flood zones, fewer than 60 percent of homeowners purchase flood insurance even though premiums are only two-thirds of own costs. Estimating flood insurance demand and cost elasticities using house-level variation in premiums from recent US congressional reforms reveals that these homeowners select into insurance based on observable differences in adaptation but not private information about risk.

Glen Weyl and Anthony Lee Zhang,"Many governments assign use licenses for natural resources, such as radio spectrum, fishing rights, and mineral extraction rights, through auctions or other market-like mechanisms. License design affects resource users' investment incentives as well as the efficiency of asset allocation. No existing license design achieves first-best outcomes on both dimensions. Long-term licenses give owners high investment incentives but impede reallocation to high-valued entrants. Short-term licenses improve allocative efficiency but discourage investment. We propose a simple new mechanism, the depreciating license, and we argue that it navigates this trade-off more effectively than existing license designs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200426

My results using the full study sample suggest that raising the minimum legal age of marriage to 18 increased age at marriage, age at first birth, and the likelihood of employment. In urban areas, the bans also reduced child marriage and increased educational attainment. Effects of the bans typically were smaller in rural areas, in countries with a lower pre-ban minimum legal age at marriage, for cohorts with lower temporal exposure to the ban, and for reducing marriage at ages just below 18, consistent with imperfect enforcement.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200008

For the least productive workers hired, the minimum wage led to a 4 percentile point shift in the productivity distribution. This increase is missed using standard observable measures of worker productivity. The effects are larger with greater pre-reform screening intensity—indicating an employer response.

AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Minimum-Wage Increases and Low-Wage Employment: Evidence from Seattle,"Ekaterina Jardim, Mark Long, Robert Plotnick, Emma  van Inwegen, Jacob Vigdor and Hilary Wething","Seattle raised its minimum wage to as much as $11 in 2015 and as much as $13 in 2016. We use Washington State administrative data to conduct two complementary analyses of its impact. Relative to outlying regions of the state identified by the synthetic control method, aggregate employment at wages less than twice the original minimum—measured by total hours worked—declined. A portion of this reduction reflects jobs transitioning to wages above the threshold; the aggregate analysis likely overstates employment effects. Longitudinal analysis of individual Seattle workers matched to counterparts in outlying regions reveals no change in the probability of continued employment but significant reductions in hours, particularly for less experienced workers. Job turnover declined, as did hiring of new workers into low-wage jobs. Analyses suggest aggregate employment elasticities in the range of −0.2 to −2.0, concentrated on the intensive margin in the short run and largest among inexperienced workers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180578
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Labor Market Impacts of Universal and Permanent Cash Transfers: Evidence from the Alaska Permanent Fund,Damon Jones and Ioana Marinescu,"Since 1982, all Alaskan residents have received a yearly cash dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund. Using the Current Population Survey and a synthetic control method, this paper shows that the dividend had no effect on employment and increased part-time work by 1.8 percentage points (17 percent). A calibration of microeconomic and macroeconomic effects suggests that the empirical results are consistent with cash stimulating the local economy—a general equilibrium effect. Nontradable sectors have a more positive employment response than tradable sectors. Overall, the results suggest that a universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190299
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Electric Gini: Income Redistribution through Energy Prices,Arik Levinson and Emilson Silva,"In theory, regulators concerned about inequality will deviate from efficient two-part tariffs, charging lower-than-efficient fixed monthly fees and higher-than-efficient per-kilowatt-hour prices. To quantify that relationship, we develop a measure of the redistributive extent of utility tariffs: the ""electric Gini."" Utilities with higher electric Ginis shift more costs from households using relatively little electricity to households using more. In practice, US utilities whose ratepayers have more unequal incomes have higher electric Ginis. But electricity demand is only loosely correlated with income, which means that electricity prices are an indirect and ineffective policy for countering income inequality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200543
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,When Does Product Liability Risk Chill Innovation? Evidence from Medical Implants,Alberto Galasso and Hong Luo,"Liability laws designed to compensate for harms caused by defective products may also affect innovation. We examine this issue by exploiting a major quasi-exogenous increase in liability risk faced by US suppliers of polymers used to manufacture medical implants. Difference-in-difference analyses show that this surge in suppliers' liability risk had a large and negative impact on downstream innovation in medical implants, but it had no significant effect on upstream polymer patenting. Our findings suggest that liability risk can percolate throughout a vertical chain and may have a significant chilling effect on downstream innovation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190757
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Mentoring and the Dynamics of Affirmative Action,Michèle Müller-Itten and Aniko Öry,"We analyze the long-term workforce composition when the quality of mentoring available to majority and minority juniors depends on their representation in the workforce. A workforce with at least 50 percent majority workers invariably converges to one where the majority is overrepresented relative to the population. To maximize welfare, persistent interventions, such as group-specific fellowships, are often needed, and the optimal workforce may include minority workers of lower innate talent than the marginal majority worker. We discuss the role of mentorship determinants, talent dispersion, the scope of short-term interventions, various policy instruments and contrast our results to the classic fairness narrative.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190579
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Effect of Charter School Openings on Traditional Public Schools in Massachusetts and North Carolina,Kirsten Slungaard Mumma,"The rapid expansion of charter schools has fueled concerns about their impact on traditional public schools. I estimate the effect of charter openings on traditional public schools in Massachusetts and North Carolina by comparing schools near actual charter sites to those near proposed sites that were never occupied. I find charter openings reduced public school enrollment by around 5 percent and reduced White enrollment in North Carolina. I find no impact on student achievement, and my 95 percent confidence intervals rule out effects larger than ±0.05 standard deviations. I find no effects on attendance or suspensions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190457
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,How Do Beliefs about the Gender Wage Gap Affect the Demand for Public Policy?,Sonja Settele,"I conduct a survey experiment to study the relationship between people's beliefs about the size of the gender wage gap and their demand for policies aimed at mitigating it. Beliefs causally affect support for equal pay legislation and affirmative action programs, but cannot account for the polarization in policy views by partisanship and gender. Changes in policy demand seem to be driven by changes in beliefs about discrimination in labor markets and fairness concerns, while self-interest appears less important. I provide evidence that pessimism about the effectiveness of government intervention limits the elasticity of policy demand to perceived wage differentials.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200559
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Valuation of Local School Quality under School Choice,Angela Zheng,"School choice programs break the link between residential location and school attendance, and should weaken the capitalization of school quality into house prices. For the first time, I quantify the effect of one such program—charter school expansions—across several states using a dataset covering charter entries and house prices. I embed an event study of charter entry into a boundary discontinuity design and find that, on average, school choice decreases the valuation of traditional schools by four percentage points. Suggestive evidence shows school choice can lead to neighborhood change through resorting as school boundaries become less important.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200678
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,School Spending and Student Outcomes: Evidence from Revenue Limit Elections in Wisconsin,E. Jason Baron,"This study examines the impacts of two distinct types of school spending on student outcomes. State-imposed revenue limits cap the total amount of revenue that a school district in Wisconsin can raise unless the district holds a referendum asking voters to exceed the cap. Importantly, Wisconsin law requires districts to hold separate referenda for operational and capital expenditures, which allows for estimating their independent effects. Leveraging close elections in a dynamic regression discontinuity framework, I find that increases in operational spending have substantial positive effects on test scores, dropout rates, and postsecondary enrollment, but additional capital expenditures have little impact.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200226
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Semesters or Quarters? The Effect of the Academic Calendar on Postsecondary Student Outcomes,"Valerie Bostwick, Stefanie Fischer and Matthew Lang","There exists a long-standing debate in higher education on which academic calendar is optimal. Using panel data on the near universe of four-year nonprofit institutions and leveraging quasi-experimental variation in calendars across institutions and years, we show that switching from quarters to semesters negatively impacts on-time graduation rates. Event study analyses show that the negative effects persist beyond the transition. Using transcript data, we replicate this analysis at the student level and investigate possible mechanisms. Shifting to a semester: (i) lowers first-year grades, (ii) decreases the probability of enrolling in a full course load, and (iii) delays the timing of major choice.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190589
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,"Yellow Vests, Pessimistic Beliefs, and Carbon Tax Aversion",Thomas Douenne and Adrien Fabre,"Using a representative survey, we find that after the Yellow Vests movement, French people would largely reject a tax and dividend policy, i.e., a carbon tax whose revenues are redistributed uniformly to each adult. They overestimate their net monetary losses, wrongly think that the policy is regressive, and do not perceive it as environmentally effective. We show that changing people's beliefs can substantially increase support. Although significant, the effects of our informational treatments on beliefs are small. Indeed, the respondents that oppose the tax tend to discard positive information about it, which is consistent with distrust, uncertainty, or motivated reasoning.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200092
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Impact of the Affordable Care Act: Evidence from California's Hospital Sector,"Mark Duggan, Atul Gupta and Emilie Jackson","We exploit changes in the discontinuity in health insurance coverage at age 65 induced by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to examine effects on coverage, hospital use, and patient health. We then link these changes to effects on hospital finances. We show that a substantial share of the federally funded Medicaid expansion substituted for existing locally funded safety net programs. Despite this offset, the expansion produced a substantial increase in hospital revenue, reflected in an equivalent increase in operating surplus. We do not detect improvements in patient mortality, although the expansion led to substantially greater hospital and emergency room use.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190279
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Issuance and Incidence: SNAP Benefit Cycles and Grocery Prices,"Jacob Goldin, Tatiana Homonoff and Katherine Meckel","Many safety net programs issue benefits as monthly lump-sum payments. We investigate how the timing of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit issuance affects food purchases and the incidence of the transfer. Using scanner data from a large sample of grocery stores and state and time variation in SNAP issuance schedules, we document large, SNAP-induced intramonth cycles in food expenditures. However, we find that retailers do not adjust prices based on these predictable patterns of demand. Our results therefore suggest that reforming issuance schedules may reduce costs from SNAP-induced demand surges but are unlikely to affect the incidence of SNAP benefits.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190777
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Reducing Frictions in College Admissions: Evidence from the Common Application,Brian Knight and Nathan Schiff,"College admissions in the United States are decentralized, creating frictions that limit student choice. We study the Common Application (CA) platform, under which students submit a single application to member schools, potentially reducing frictions and increasing student choice. The CA increases the number of applications received by schools, reflecting a reduction in frictions, and reduces the yield on accepted students, reflecting increased choice. The CA increases out-of-state enrollment, especially from other CA states, consistent with network effects. Entry into the CA changes the composition of students, with evidence of more racial diversity and more high-income students and imprecise evidence of increases in SAT scores.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190694
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,How Do Households Value the Future? Evidence from Property Taxes,Hans Koster and Edward Pinchbeck,"Despite the near ubiquity of intertemporal choice, there is little consensus on the rate at which individuals trade present and future costs and benefits. We contribute to this debate by estimating discount rates from extensive data on housing transactions and spatiotemporal variation in property taxes in England. Our findings imply long-term average net of growth nominal discount rates that are between 3 and 4 percent. The close correspondence to prevailing market interest rates gives little reason to suggest that households misoptimize by materially undervaluing very long-term financial flows in this high-stakes context.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200443
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Effects of Mortgage Credit Availability: Evidence from Minimum Credit Score Lending Rules,Steven Laufer and Andrew Paciorek,"This paper uses changes in mortgage lenders' minimum credit score thresholds to credibly identify the effects of access to household credit. Falling under these thresholds has very large negative effects on borrowing for up to two years, and these effects fail to reverse within four years. The effects are particularly concentrated among individuals who have relatively high credit demand and face relatively large contractions in credit supply. In addition, access to new mortgage credit reduces delinquency on nonmortgage debt and appears to spill over to demand for auto loans.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180229
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Dominated Options in Health Insurance Plans,Chenyuan Liu and Justin Sydnor,"Prior research documents that there are sometimes dominated options in health plan menus, but is that common? We analyze Kaiser Family Foundation data on health plans that firms offer to their employees. For firms offering both a high-deductible and lower-deductible health plan, 62 percent of the time the high-deductible option has lower maximum spending risk for the employee. We estimate that the high-deductible plan dominates at roughly half of firms. We discuss potential mechanisms behind these surprising patterns and find support both for two explanations: widespread adverse-selection pricing and some employers also differentially favoring high-deductible plans.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190312
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Effect of Charter Schools on School Segregation,"Tomás Monarrez, Brian Kisida and Matthew Chingos","We examine the impact of the expansion of charter schools on racial segregation in public schools, defined using multiple measures of racial sorting and isolation. Our research design utilizes between-grade differences in charter expansion within school systems and an instrumental variables approach leveraging charter school openings. Charter schools modestly increase school segregation for Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White students. On average, charters have caused a 6 percent decrease in the relative likelihood of Black and Hispanic students being exposed to schoolmates of other racial or ethnic groups. For metropolitan areas, our analysis reveals countervailing forces, as charters reduce segregation between districts.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190682

Using experimental variation, we examine the impact of electronic tax filing (to replace in-person submission to tax officials) using data from Tajikistan firms. E-filing reduces the time firms spend on taxes by 40 percent. Further, among firms previously more likely to evade, e-filing doubles taxes paid. Conversely, evidence suggests that e-filing reduces tax payments among firms previously less likely to evade. These firms also pay fewer bribes, as e-filing reduces extortion opportunities. These patterns are consistent with differential treatment of firms by tax officials prior to e-filing.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200123

Barreca,"The Acid Rain Program (ARP) cut sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from power plants in the United States, with considerable benefits. We show this also reduced ambient sulfate levels, which lowered agriculture productivity through decreased soil sulfur. Using plant-level SO2 emissions and an atmospheric transport model, we estimate the relationship between airborne sulfate levels and yields for corn and soybeans. We estimate crop revenue losses for these two crops at around $1–$1.5 billion per year, with accompanying decreases in land value. Back-of-the-envelope calculations of the costs to replace lost sulfur suggest producer responses were limited and suboptimal.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190060
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,The Rising Value of Time and the Origin of Urban Gentrification,Yichen Su,"In recent decades, gentrification has transformed American central city neighborhoods. I estimate a spatial equilibrium model to show that the rising value of high-skilled workers' time contributes to the gentrification of American central cities. I show that the increasing value of time raises the cost of commuting and exogenously increases the demand for central locations by high-skilled workers. While change in the value of time has a modest direct effect on gentrification of central cities, the effect is substantially magnified by endogenous amenity change driven by the changes in local skill mix.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190550
AEJ: Economic Policy,2022,Improving Preferential Market Access through Rules of Origin: Firm-Level Evidence from Bangladesh,Tobias Sytsma,"In countries where there exist limited opportunities to source inputs locally, rules of origin undermine access to preferential trade agreements for final goods exporters. I analyze the 2011 revision to the rules of origin associated with the European Union's Generalized System of Preferences, which allowed apparel producers in least developed countries to use internationally sourced textiles in exported products. Using transaction-level data on Bangladeshi apparel firms, I find that the rules of origin effectively cut the preferential margin by three-fourths. Liberalizing the rules of origin resulted in firm-level revenue growth, which was driven by the intensive margin through increased shipment sizes and quality upgrading.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200257

This paper studies a unique reform in Germany that allowed workers to hold small secondary jobs tax-free, decreasing the marginal tax rate by between 19.5 to 66 pp. I show that the reform resulted in a dramatic increase in moonlighting that was not offset by reductions in primary earnings and that hours constraints are a key determinant of moonlighting.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190786

We examine an experiment in Finland in which 2,000 benefit recipients were randomized to receive a monthly basic income. The experiment lowered participation tax rates by 23 percentage points for full-time employment. Despite the considerable increase in work incentives, days in employment remained statistically unchanged in the first year of the experiment. Moreover, even though all job search requirements were waived, participation in reemployment services remained high.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200143
