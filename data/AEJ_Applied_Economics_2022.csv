AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Mortality Change among Less Educated Americans,"Paul Novosad, Charlie Rafkin and Sam Asher","Measurements of mortality change among less educated Americans can be biased because the least educated groups (e.g., dropouts) become smaller and more negatively selected over time. We show that mortality changes at constant education percentiles can be bounded with minimal assumptions. Middle-age mortality increases among non-Hispanic Whites from 1992 to 2018 are driven almost entirely by the bottom 10 percent of the education distribution. Drivers of mortality change differ substantially across groups. Deaths of despair explain most of the mortality change among young non-Hispanic Whites, but less among older Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks. Our bounds are applicable in many other contexts.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190297
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Competition and Pass-Through: Evidence from Isolated Markets,Christos Genakos and Mario Pagliero,"We measure how pass-through varies with competition in isolated oligopolistic markets with captive consumers. Using daily pricing data from gas stations on small Greek islands, we study how unanticipated and exogenous changes in excise duties are passed through to consumers in markets with different numbers of retailers. We find that pass-through increases from 0.4 in monopoly markets to 1 in markets with four or more competitors and remains constant thereafter. The speed of price adjustment is about 60 percent higher in more competitive markets. Finally, we show that geographic market definitions based on measures of distance across sellers often result in significant overestimation of the pass-through.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200863
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Using Individual-Level Randomized Treatment to Learn about Market Structure,Lorenzo Casaburi and Tristan Reed,Interference across competing firms in RCTs can be informative about market structure. An experiment that subsidizes a random subset of traders who buy cocoa from farmers in Sierra Leone illustrates this idea. Interpreting treatment-control differences in prices and quantities purchased from farmers through a model of Cournot competition reveals differentiation between traders is low. Combining this result with quasi-experimental variation in world prices shows that the number of traders competing is 50 percent higher than the number operating in a village. Own-price and cross-price supply elasticities are high. Farmers face a competitive market in this first stage of the value chain.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200306
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Time to Repay or Time to Delay? The Effect of Having More Time before a Payday Loan Is Due,"Susan Carter, Kuan Liu, Paige Marta Skiba and Justin Sydnor","We examine the effect of state laws on minimum payday loan durations that give some borrowers an additional pay cycle to repay their initial loan with no other changes to contract terms. Neoclassical models predict this ""grace period"" would reduce borrowers' need for costly loan rollovers. However, in reality, borrowers' repayment behavior with grace periods is very similar to borrowers with shorter loans, merely pushed out a few weeks. Potential explanations include heuristic repayment decisions and naive present focus. A calibrated model suggests that present-focused borrowers get less than one-half of the benefit from a grace period that time-consistent borrowers would.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180721

I study the implications of this round trip effect on international trade and trade policy. I identify this effect and develop an instrument using it to estimate the impact of transport costs on trade. I simulate counterfactual import tariff increases in a quantitative model and quantify the importance of endogenizing transport costs with respect to this effect: an exogenous transport costs model predicts a trade balance improvement from protectionist policies, while the round trip model finds the opposite.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190721

We analyze a reform that limits campaign spending for mayoral elections. The limits were implemented with a discontinuity that we exploit for causal identification. We find that stricter limits reduce reelection rates and increase political competition by attracting more candidates who are also less wealthy and rely less on self-financing. Despite their effects on electoral outcomes, stricter limits did not lead to significant short-run improvements in policy outcomes, such as in education and health.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200296
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Leave the Door Open? Prison Conditions and Recidivism,Giovanni Mastrobuoni and Daniele Terlizzese,We estimate the effect on recidivism of replacing time served in a common closed-cell prison with time served in an open-cell one. We deal with the endogenous assignment of inmates to different prison regimes using variation that is driven by nearby prisons' overcrowding. Switching regimes for a year reduces recidivism by around 6 percentage points. The effects are largest for inmates with low levels of education and are weak for violent and hardened criminals.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190038
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,The Health Effects of Prison,Randi Hjalmarsson and Matthew Lindquist,"This paper studies the health effects of Swedish prison reforms that held sentences constant but increased the share of time inmates had to serve. The increased time served did not harm post-release health and actually reduced mortality risk. We find especially large decreases in mortality for offenders not previously incarcerated, younger offenders, and those more attached to the labor market. Risk of suicide and circulatory death fell for inmates with mental health problems and older inmates, respectively. In-prison health care utilization and program participation increased with time served, suggesting health care treatment and services as the key mechanism for mortality declines.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200615

Using health records of 2 million US veterans with emergency department visits, we find that quasi-random assignment to a top (versus bottom) decile prescribing provider significantly increases subsequent opioid use and misuse rates. Instrumental variable results show that opioid prescription receipt leads to a 20 percent increase in the probability of long-term prescription opioid use and sizable increases in the development of opioid use disorder and opioid overdose mortality. We find suggestive evidence of transition into illicit opioids due to prescription opioid exposure.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210048

We show that the march's capital destruction led to a large contraction in agricultural investment, farming asset prices, and manufacturing activity compared to neighboring counties. Elements of the decline in agriculture persisted through 1920. Exploiting variation in local access to antebellum credit, we argue that the underdevelopment of financial markets played a role in weakening the recovery.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200397
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,The Impact of Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises on Workers,David Arnold,"While privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) remains a popular policy tool in many countries, the impacts on workers are unclear. This paper studies the case of Brazil, which implemented a large privatization program in the 1990s. Following privatization, incumbent workers in privatized SOEs suffer a wage decline of roughly 25 percent relative to a matched control group. Additionally, private sector firms that are connected to privatized SOEs by labor mobility also reduce wages. A summary calculation suggests that privatization decreased the formal sector wage by 3 percent, with about two-thirds of this effect due to the indirect impact on private sector workers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190428
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Is Zero a Special Price? Evidence from Child Health Care,Toshiaki Iizuka and Hitoshi Shigeoka,"Do consumers react differently to zero prices? We test the presence of a zero-price effect in child health care and find that a zero price is special as it boosts demand discontinuously. A zero price affects resource allocations by encouraging healthier children to use more services and exacerbates behavioral hazard by increasing inappropriate use of antibiotics. A co-payment, of as small as US$2 per visit, alleviates these problems without substantially increasing financial risk. However, a zero price may be used to boost demand for highly cost-effective treatments. Zero and non-zero prices should be strategically chosen to achieve specific goals.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210184
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,The Impact of Presidential Appointment of Judges: Montesquieu or the Federalists?,Sultan Mehmood,"A central question in development economics is whether there are adequate checks and balances on the executive. This paper provides causal evidence of how increasing constraints on the executive—via removal of presidential discretion in judicial appointments—promotes the rule of law. The age structure of judges at the time of the reform and the mandatory retirement age law provide us with an exogenous source of variation in the termination of presidential discretion in judicial appointments. Overall, the results indicate that presidential appointment of judges deteriorates the rule of law. Even one degree of separation between the judiciary and the president matters.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210176
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Lifetime Earnings in the United States over Six Decades,"Fatih Guvenen, Greg Kaplan, Jae Song and Justin Weidner","Between the 1957 and 1983 labor market entry cohorts, median lifetime earnings declined by 10–19 percent for men and increased by 22–33 percent for women, albeit relative to very low median lifetime earnings for the early cohorts. The difference between newer and older cohorts comes from differences in median earnings at the time of labor market entry. Inequality in lifetime earnings has increased significantly within each gender group, but the closing lifetime gender gap has kept overall lifetime inequality flat. The increase among men is largely attributable to subsequent cohorts entering the labor market with progressively higher levels of inequality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190489

Our estimates are consistent with macroeconomic growth and comparable with US distributional national accounts. Inequality grew in nearly all European countries, but much less than in the US. Contrary to a widespread view, we demonstrate that Europe's lower inequality levels cannot be explained by more equalizing tax and transfer systems. After accounting for indirect taxes and in-kind transfers, the US redistributes a greater share of national income to low-income groups than any European country. ""Predistribution,"" not ""redistribution,"" explains why Europe is less unequal than the United States.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200703

This estimate is the result of coding and data errors and of sample selection. Correcting the errors reduces the point estimate by two-thirds, with a wide 95 percent confidence interval straddling zero. Enlarging the sample to 1990–2019 flips the point estimate's sign and rules out the effect size reported by Heyes and Saberian with very high confidence.

Eide, Kevin Mumford, Richard Patterson and Merrill Warnick","We document that college completion rates have increased since the 1990s, after declining in the 1970s and 1980s. We find that most of the increase in graduation rates can be explained by grade inflation and that other factors, such as changing student characteristics and institutional resources, play little or no role. This is because GPA strongly predicts graduation, and GPAs have been rising since the 1990s. This finding holds in national survey data and in records from nine large public universities.

AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Neighbors' Effects on University Enrollment,Andres Barrios-Fernández,This paper combines detailed geographic information and individual educational records in Chile to provide causal evidence that close neighbors significantly influence enrollment in university. I exploit the quasi-random variation generated by student loans eligibility rules and find that potential applicants are significantly more likely to attend and complete university when their closest neighbor—defined as the closest individual applying to university one year before—becomes eligible for a student loan and enrolls in university. These results highlight the importance of social influences on university enrollment and suggest that financial aid and university access policies may have important spillover effects.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200360

Our estimates of mobility are higher than prior work using survey data and indirect methods. The rank-rank slope of parent-child income is 0.22, compared to 0.18 in Denmark and 0.34 in the United States. The probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 0.11.

Students who barely met the grade point average threshold to major in economics earned $22,000 (46 percent) higher annual early-career wages than they would have with their second-choice majors. Access to the economics major shifts students' preferences toward business/finance careers, and about half of the wage return is explained by economics majors working in higher-paying industries.

Using administrative data from a large employer and a regression discontinuity design, I estimate the marginal propensity to consume from HSA assets is 0.85 and reject the neoclassical benchmark of 0. Comparisons with 401(k) saving show most employees do not treat HSA money as fungible with retirement savings. In this setting, HSAs did not reduce health spending and instead increased the share that was financed tax-free.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200135
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,"Recessions, Mortality, and Migration Bias: Evidence from the Lancashire Cotton Famine","Vellore Arthi, Brian Beach and W Hanlon","We examine the health effects of the Lancashire Cotton Famine, a sharp downturn in Britain's cotton textile manufacturing regions that was induced by the US Civil War. Migration was an important response to this downturn, but as we document, migration also introduces a number of empirical challenges, which we overcome by introducing a new methodological approach. Our results indicate that the recession increased mortality among households employed in the cotton textile industry. We also document localized spillover effects on households providing nontradable services in the areas affected by the recession.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190131
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Formative Experiences and the Price of Gasoline,Christopher Severen and Arthur A.  van Benthem,"Formative experiences shape behavior for decades. We document a striking feature about those who came of driving age during the oil crises of the 1970s⁠—they drive less in the year 2000. The effect is not specific to these cohorts; price variation over time and across states indicates that gasoline price changes between ages 15–18 generally shift later-life travel behavior. Effects are not explained by recessions, income, or costly skill acquisition and are inconsistent with recency bias, mental plasticity, and standard habit-formation models. Instead, they likely reflect formation of preferences for driving or persistent changes in its perceived cost.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200407
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Unemployment Insurance as a Worker Indiscipline Device? Evidence from Scanner Data,"Lester Lusher, Geoffrey Schnorr and Rebecca Taylor","We provide causal evidence of an ex ante moral hazard effect of unemployment insurance (UI) by matching plausibly exogenous changes in UI benefit duration across state-weeks during the Great Recession to high-frequency productivity measures from individual supermarket cashiers. Estimating models with date and cashier-register fixed effects, we identify a modest but statistically significant negative relationship between UI benefits and worker productivity. This effect is strongest for more experienced and less productive cashiers, for whom UI expansions are especially relevant. Additional analyses from the American Time Use Survey reveal a similar increase in shirking during periods with increased UI benefit durations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190007
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Mental Health Costs of Lockdowns: Evidence from Age-Specific Curfews in Turkey,"Onur Altindag, Bilge Erten and Pinar Keskin","Using a strict, age-specific lockdown order for adults aged 65 and older in Turkey, we examine the mental health consequences of an extended period of tight mobility restrictions on senior adults. Adopting a regression discontinuity design, we find that the curfew-induced decline in mobility substantially worsened mental health outcomes, including somatic and nonsomatic symptoms of mental distress (approximately 0.2 standard deviation). Exploring potential channels, we document an increase in social and physical isolation, with no evidence of robust changes in labor market outcomes or intrahousehold conflict for this subpopulation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200811
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Rational Habit Formation: Experimental Evidence from Handwashing in India,"Reshmaan Hussam, Atonu Rabbani, Giovanni Reggiani and Natalia Rigol","We test the predictions of the rational addiction model, reconceptualized as rational habit formation, in the context of handwashing in rural India. To track handwashing, we design soap dispensers with timed sensors. We test for rational habit formation by informing some households about a future change in the returns to daily handwashing. Monitoring and incentives raise handwashing contemporaneously, and effects persist well after they end. In addition, people are rational about this habit formation: when they anticipate future monitoring, they increase their current handwashing. Average child weight and height increase for all study arms given soap dispensers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190568
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,The Long-Run Effects of Recessions on Education and Income,Bryan Stuart,"This paper examines the long-run effects of the 1980–1982 recession on education and income. Using confidential census data, I estimate difference-in-difference regressions that exploit variation across counties in recession severity and across cohorts in age at the time of the recession. For individuals age 0–10 in 1979, a 10 percent decrease in earnings per capita in their county of birth reduces four-year college degree attainment by 15 percent and earnings in adulthood by 5 percent. Simple calculations suggest that in aggregate, the 1980–1982 recession led to 1.3–2.8 million fewer college graduates and $66–$139 billion less earned income per year.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180055
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Finally a Smoking Gun? Compensating Differentials and the Introduction of Smoking Bans,Daniel Wissmann,"Using the staggered introduction of smoking bans in the German hospitality industry over 2007–2008, I find a robust 2.4 percent decline in the daily earnings of workers in bars and restaurants associated with the most comprehensive smoking ban. This effect is unlikely to be driven by a decline in hospitality revenues or hours worked but is consistent with a simple model of compensating differentials.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180077
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Can Information Reduce Ethnic Discrimination? Evidence from Airbnb,Morgane Laouenan and Roland Rathelot,"We use data from Airbnb to identify the mechanisms underlying discrimination against ethnic minority hosts. Within the same neighborhood, hosts from minority groups charge 3.2 percent less for comparable listings. Since ratings provide guests with increasingly rich information about a listing's quality, we can measure the contribution of statistical discrimination, building upon Altonji and Pierret (2001). We find that statistical discrimination can account for the whole ethnic price gap: ethnic gaps would disappear if all unobservables were revealed. Also, three-quarters (2.5 points) of the initial ethnic gap can be attributed to inaccurate beliefs of potential guests about hosts' average group quality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190188
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,"Information Frictions, Internet, and the Relationship between Distance and Trade","Anders Akerman, Edwin Leuven and Magne Mogstad",We examine how the adoption of information communication technology affects bilateral trade. The context is a public program in Norway that rolled out broadband access points leading to plausibly exogenous variation in the availability and adoption of broadband by firms. We find that broadband makes trade patterns more sensitive to distance and economic size. These results are consistent with a model of trade with variable elasticity of demand. The model predicts that adoption of a technology that lowers information frictions enlarges the choice set of exporters and importers. This makes demand more elastic with respect to trade costs and thus distance.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190589
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Subways and Urban Air Pollution,"Nicolas Gendron-Carrier, Marco Gonzalez-Navarro, Stefano Polloni and Matthew Turner","We investigate the effect of subway system openings on urban air pollution. On average, particulate concentrations are unchanged by subway openings. For cities with higher initial pollution levels, subway openings reduce particulates by 4 percent in the area surrounding a city center. The effect decays with distance to city center and persists over the longest time horizon that we can measure with our data, about four years. For highly polluted cities, we estimate that a new subway system provides an external mortality benefit of about $1 billion per year. For less polluted cities, the effect is indistinguishable from zero. Back of the envelope cost estimates suggest that reduced mortality due to lower air pollution offsets a substantial share of the construction costs of subways.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180168
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Labor Market Returns to Vocational Secondary Education,Mikko Silliman and Hanna Virtanen,"We study labor market returns to vocational versus general secondary education using a regression discontinuity design created by the centralized admissions process in Finland. Admission to the vocational track increases initial annual income, and this benefit persists at least through the mid-thirties, and present discount value calculations suggest that it is unlikely that life cycle returns will turn negative through retirement. Moreover, admission to the vocational track does not increase the likelihood of working in jobs at risk of replacement by automation or offshoring. Consistent with comparative advantage, we observe larger returns for people who express a preference for vocational education.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190782
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Does Patient Demand Contribute to the Overuse of Prescription Drugs?,"Carolina Lopez, Anja Sautmann and Simone Schaner","In an experiment in Mali, we tested whether patients pressure providers to prescribe unnecessary medical treatment. We varied patients' information about a discount for antimalarial tablets and measure demand for both tablets and costlier antimalarial injections. We find evidence of patient-driven demand: informing patients about the discount, instead of letting providers decide to share this information, increased discount use by 35 percent and overall malaria treatment by 10 percent. These marginal patients rarely had malaria, worsening the illness-treatment match. Providers did not use the information advantage to sell injections—their use fell in both information conditions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190722
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,The Origins of Common Identity: Evidence from Alsace-Lorraine,Sirus Dehdari and Kai Gehring,"We study how more negative historical exposure to the actions of nation-states—like war, occupation, and repression—affects the formation of regional identity. The quasi-exogenous division of the French regions Alsace and Lorraine allows us to implement a geographical regression discontinuity design at the municipal level. Using measures of stated and revealed preferences, we find that more negative experiences with nation-states are associated with a stronger regional identity in the short, medium, and long run. This is linked to preferences for more regional decision-making. Establishing regional organizations seems to be a key mechanism to maintaining and strengthening regional identity.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190772
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,How Effective Are Monetary Incentives to Vote? Evidence from a Nationwide Policy,"Mariella Gonzales, Gianmarco León-Ciliotta and Luis Martinez","We study voters' response to marginal changes to the fine for electoral abstention in Peru, leveraging variation from a nationwide reform. A smaller fine has a robust, negative effect on voter turnout, partly through irregular changes in voter registration. However, representation is largely unaffected, as most of the lost votes are blank or invalid. We also show that the effect of an exemption from compulsory voting is substantially larger than that of a full fine reduction, suggesting that nonmonetary incentives are the main drivers behind the effectiveness of compulsory voting.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200482
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,Inversions in US Presidential Elections: 1836–2016,"Michael Geruso, Dean Spears and Ishaana Talesara","Inversions—in which the popular vote winner loses the election—have occurred in four US presidential races. We show that rather than being statistical flukes, inversions have been ex ante likely since the early 1800s. In elections yielding a popular vote margin within 1 point (one-eighth of presidential elections), about 40 percent will be inversions in expectation. We show this conditional probability is remarkably stable across historical periods—despite differences in which groups voted, which states existed, and which parties participated. Our findings imply that the United States has experienced so few inversions merely because there have been so few elections (and fewer close elections).",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20200210
AEJ: Applied Economics,2022,The Political Impact of Immigration: Evidence from the United States,"Anna Maria Mayda, Giovanni Peri and Walter Steingress","This paper studies the impact of immigration to the United States on the vote share for the Republican Party using county-level data from 1990 to 2016. Our main contribution is to show that an increase in high-skilled immigrants decreases the share of Republican votes, while an inflow of low-skilled immigrants increases it. These effects are mainly due to the indirect impact on existing citizens' votes, and this is independent of the origin country and race of immigrants. We find that the political effect of immigration is heterogeneous across counties and depends on their skill level, public spending, and noneconomic characteristics.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190081
