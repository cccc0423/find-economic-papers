Journal of Econometrics,2022,Stationary vine copula models for multivariate time series,"Thomas Nagler, Daniel Krüger and Aleksey Min","Multivariate time series exhibit two types of dependence: across variables and across time points. Vine copulas are graphical models for the dependence and can conveniently capture both types of dependence in the same model. We derive the maximal class of graph structures that guarantee stationarity under a natural and verifiable condition called translation invariance. We propose computationally efficient methods for estimation, simulation, prediction, and uncertainty quantification and show their validity by asymptotic results and simulations. The theoretical results allow for misspecified models and, even when specialized to the iid case, go beyond what is available in the literature. The new model class is illustrated by an application to forecasting returns of a portfolio of 20 stocks, where they show excellent forecast performance. The paper is accompanied by an open source software implementation.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621003043

For this purpose, we formulate primitive conditions for global identification, invertibility, strong consistency, and asymptotic normality both under correct specification and misspecification of the model.

Journal of Econometrics,2022,Semiparametric testing with highly persistent predictors,Bas J.M. Werker and Bo Zhou,"We address the issue of semiparametric efficiency in the bivariate regression problem with a highly persistent predictor, where the joint distribution of the innovations is regarded an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter. Using a structural representation of the limit experiment and exploiting invariance relationships therein, we construct invariant point-optimal tests for the regression coefficient of interest. This approach naturally leads to a family of feasible tests based on the component-wise ranks of the innovations that can gain considerable power relative to existing tests under non-Gaussian innovation distributions, while behaving equivalently under Gaussianity. When an i.i.d. assumption on the innovations is appropriate for the data at hand, our tests exploit the efficiency gains possible. Moreover, we show by simulation that our test remains well behaved under some forms of conditional heteroskedasticity.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621001573
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Functional coefficient panel modeling with communal smoothing covariates,Peter Phillips and Ying Wang,"Behavior at the individual level in panels is often influenced by aspects of the system in aggregate. In particular, the interaction between individual-specific explanatory variables and an individual dependent variable may be affected by ‘global’ variables that are relevant in decision making and shared communally by all individuals in the sample. To capture such behavioral features, we employ a functional coefficient panel model in which certain communal covariates may jointly influence panel interactions by means of their impact on the model coefficients. Two classes of estimation procedures are proposed, one based on cross-section averaged data, the other on the full panel. The asymptotic properties of these methods are obtained and compared, allowing for sequential and joint expansion of the cross-section and time series sample sizes. Limit theory for the associated fixed effects estimators is derived and inferential procedures are developed to test hypotheses concerning the functional coefficients. The finite sample performance of the proposed estimators and tests are examined by simulation. An empirical illustration is provided in which the regional sensitivity of housing rental prices to available job numbers is studied with national labor force participation rate as the communal smoothing covariate. Strong evidence is found supporting the functional coefficient specification with this country-wide smoothing variable.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621000944
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Simultaneous inference for time-varying models,"Sayar Karmakar, Stefan Richter and Wei Biao Wu","A general class of non-stationary time series is considered in this paper. We estimate the time-varying coefficients by using local linear M-estimation. For these estimators, weak Bahadur representations are obtained and are used to construct simultaneous confidence bands. For practical implementation, we propose a bootstrap based method to circumvent the slow logarithmic convergence of the theoretical simultaneous bands. Our results substantially generalize and unify the treatments for several time-varying regression and auto-regression models. The performance for tvARCH and tvGARCH models is studied in simulations and a few real-life applications of our study are presented through the analysis of some popular financial datasets.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621000725
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Residual-augmented IVX predictive regression,Matei Demetrescu and Paulo Rodrigues,"Bias correction in predictive regressions is known to reduce the empirical size problems of OLS-based predictability tests with persistent predictors. This paper shows that bias correction is also achieved in the context of the extended instrumental variable (IVX) predictability testing framework introduced by Kostakis et al. (2015). To be specific, new IVX-based statistics subject to a bias correction analogous to that proposed by Amihud and Hurvich (2004) are introduced. Four important contributions are provided: first, we characterize the effects that bias-reduction adjustments have on the asymptotic distributions of the IVX test statistics in a general context allowing for short-run dynamics and heterogeneity; second, we discuss the validity of the procedure when predictors are stationary as well as near-integrated; third, we conduct an exhaustive Monte Carlo analysis to investigate the small in- and out-of-sample properties of the test procedures and their sensitivity to distinctive features that characterize predictive regressions in practice, such as strong persistence, endogeneity, and non-Gaussian innovations; and fourth, we provide an analysis of real estate return and rent growth predictability in 19 OECD countries.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762030395X
Journal of Econometrics,2022,The drift burst hypothesis,"Kim Christensen, Roel Oomen and Roberto Renò","The drift burst hypothesis postulates the existence of short-lived locally explosive trends in the price paths of financial assets. The recent U.S. equity and treasury flash crashes can be viewed as two high-profile manifestations of such dynamics, but we argue that drift bursts of varying magnitude are an expected and regular occurrence in financial markets that can arise through established mechanisms of liquidity provision. We show how to build drift bursts into the continuous-time Itô semimartingale model, elaborate on the conditions required for the process to remain arbitrage-free, and propose a nonparametric test statistic that identifies drift bursts from noisy high-frequency data. We apply the test and demonstrate that drift bursts are a stylized fact of the price dynamics across equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. Drift bursts occur once a week on average, and the majority of them are accompanied by subsequent price reversion and can thus be regarded as “flash crashes.” The reversal is found to be stronger for negative drift bursts with large trading volume, which is consistent with endogenous demand for immediacy during market crashes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620303912
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Comment on “Large Bayesian vector autoregressions with stochastic volatility and non-conjugate priors”,Mark Bognanni,"Fully Bayesian inference in a vector autoregression with stochastic volatility (VAR-SV) typically relies on simulations from a multi-step Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Carriero et al. (2019) propose a new, faster, “triangular” algorithm (TA) to replace the systemwide algorithm (SWA) in the most time-consuming step of the VAR-SV’s standard MCMC algorithm. This paper analytically shows that the TA and SWA generally sample from different distributions, thereby disproving a central claim of Carriero et al. (2019). Replacing the SWA with the TA thus results in an ad hoc change to the MCMC algorithm’s transition kernel, leaving a priori unknown the formal relationship between the model’s posterior and simulations from the MCMC algorithm using the TA.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621002554
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Goodness-of-fit testing for time series models via distance covariance,Phyllis Wan and Richard A. Davis,"In many statistical modeling frameworks, goodness-of-fit tests are typically administered to the estimated residuals. In the time series setting, whiteness of the residuals is assessed using the sample autocorrelation function. For many time series models, especially those used for financial time series, the key assumption on the residuals is that they are in fact independent and not just uncorrelated. In this paper, we apply the auto-distance covariance function (ADCV) to evaluate the serial dependence of the estimated residuals. Distance covariance can discriminate between dependence and independence of two random vectors. The limit behavior of the test statistic based on the ADCV is derived for a general class of time series models. One of the key aspects in this theory is adjusting for the dependence that arises due to parameter estimation. This adjustment has essentially the same form regardless of the model specification. We illustrate the results in simulated examples.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620302256
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Understanding temporal aggregation effects on kurtosis in financial indices,Offer Lieberman and Peter Phillips,"Indices of financial returns typically display sample kurtosis that declines towards the Gaussian value 3 as the sampling interval increases. This paper uses stochastic unit root (STUR) and continuous time analysis to explain the phenomenon. Limit theory for the sample kurtosis reveals that STUR specifications provide two sources of excess kurtosis, both of which decline with the sampling interval. Limiting kurtosis is shown to be random and is a functional of the limiting price process. Using a continuous time version of the model under no-drift, local drift, and drift inclusions, we suggest a new continuous time kurtosis measure for financial returns that assists in reconciling these models with the empirical kurtosis characteristics of returns. Simulations are reported and applications to several financial indices demonstrate the usefulness of this approach.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762030258X
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Testing the existence of moments for GARCH processes,Christian Francq and Jean-Michel Zakoian,"It is generally admitted that many financial time series have heavy tailed marginal distributions. When time series models are fitted on such data, the non-existence of appropriate moments may invalidate standard statistical tools used for inference. Moreover, the existence of moments can be crucial for risk management, for instance when risk is measured through the expected shortfall. This paper considers testing the existence of moments in the framework of GARCH processes. While the second-order stationarity condition does not depend on the distribution of the innovation, higher-order moment conditions involve moments of the independent innovation process. We propose tests for the existence of high moments of the returns process which are based on the joint asymptotic distribution of the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood (QML) estimator of the volatility parameters and empirical moments of the residuals. A bootstrap procedure is proposed to improve the finite-sample performance of our test. To achieve efficiency gains we consider non Gaussian QML estimators founded on reparameterizations of the GARCH model, and we discuss optimality issues. Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical study illustrate the asymptotic results.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620302268
Journal of Econometrics,2022,A time-varying parameter model for local explosions,"Francisco Blasques, Siem Jan Koopman and Marc Nientker","Financial and economic time series can feature locally explosive behaviour when bubbles are formed. We develop a time-varying parameter model that is capable of describing this behaviour in time series data. Our proposed dynamic model can be used to predict the emergence, existence and burst of bubbles. We adopt a flexible observation driven model specification that allows for different bubble shapes and behaviour. We establish stationarity, ergodicity, and bounded moments of the data generated by our model. Furthermore, we obtain the consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Given the parameter estimates in the model, the implied filter is capable of extracting the unobserved bubble process from the observed data. We study finite-sample properties of our estimator through a Monte Carlo simulation study. Finally, we show that our model compares well with existing noncausal models in a financial application concerning the Bitcoin/US dollar exchange rate.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621001846
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Testing for episodic predictability in stock returns,"Matei Demetrescu, Iliyan Georgiev, Paulo Rodrigues and Robert Taylor","Standard tests based on predictive regressions estimated over the full available sample data have tended to find little evidence of predictability in stock returns. Recent approaches based on the analysis of subsamples of the data suggest in fact that predictability where it occurs might exist only within so-called “pockets of predictability” rather than across the entire sample. However, these methods are prone to the criticism that the subsample dates are endogenously determined such that the use of standard critical values appropriate for full sample tests will result in incorrectly sized tests leading to spurious findings of stock returns predictability. To avoid the problem of endogenously-determined sample splits, we propose new tests derived from sequences of predictability statistics systematically calculated over subsamples of the data. Specifically, we will base tests on the maximum of such statistics from sequences of forward and backward recursive, rolling, and double-recursive predictive subsample regressions. We develop our approach using the over-identified instrumental variable-based predictability test statistics of Breitung and Demetrescu (2015). This approach is based on partial-sum asymptotics and so, unlike many other popular approaches including, for example, those based on Bonferroni corrections, can be readily adapted to implementation over sequences of subsamples. We show that the limiting null distributions of our proposed test statistics depend in general on whether the putative predictor is strongly or weakly persistent and on any heteroskedasticity present (indeed on any time-variation present in the unconditional variance matrix of the innovations), the latter even if the subsample statistics are based on heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. As a consequence, we develop fixed regressor wild bootstrap implementations of the tests which we demonstrate to be first-order asymptotically valid. Finite sample behaviour against a variety of temporarily predictable processes is considered. An empirical application to US stock returns illustrates the usefulness of the new predictability testing methods we propose.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300026
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Testing capital asset pricing models using functional-coefficient panel data models with cross-sectional dependence,"Zongwu Cai, Ying Fang and Qiuhua Xu","This paper proposes a functional-coefficient panel data model with cross-sectional dependence motivated by re-examining the empirical performance of conditional capital asset pricing model. In order to characterize the time-varying property of assets’ betas and alpha, our proposed model allows the betas to be unknown functions of some macroeconomic and financial instruments. Moreover, a common factor structure is introduced to characterize cross-sectional dependence which is an attractive feature under a panel data regression setting as different assets or portfolios may be affected by same unobserved shocks. Compared to the existing studies, such as the classic Fama–MacBeth two-step procedure, our model can achieve substantial efficiency gains for inference by adopting a one-step procedure using the entire sample rather than a single cross-sectional regression at each time point. We propose a local linear common correlated effects estimator for estimating time-varying betas by pooling the data. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are established. Another methodological and empirical challenge in asset pricing is how to test the constancy of conditional betas and the significance of pricing errors, we echo this challenge by constructing an L2-norm statistic for functional-coefficient panel data models allowing for cross-sectional dependence. We show that the new test statistic has a limiting standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis. Finally, the method is applied to test the model in Fama and French (1993) using Fama–French 25 and 100 portfolios, sorted by size and book-to-market ratio, respectively, dated from July 1963 to July 2018.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620302086
Journal of Econometrics,2022,β in the tails,Federico M. Bandi and Roberto Renò,"Do hedge funds hedge? In negative states of the world, often not as much as they should. For several styles, we report larger market betas when market returns are low (i.e., “beta in the tails”). We justify this finding through a combination of negative-mean jumps in the market returns and large market jump betas: when moving to the left tail of the market return distribution jump dynamics dominate continuous dynamics and the overall systematic risk of the fund is driven by the higher systematic risk associated with return discontinuities. Methodologically, the separation of continuous and discontinuous dynamics is conducted by exploiting the informational content of the high-order infinitesimal cross-moments of hedge-fund and market returns.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620302128
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Efficient estimation of high-dimensional dynamic covariance by risk factor mapping: Applications for financial risk management,"Mike K.P. So, Thomas W.C. Chan and Amanda M.Y. Chu","This paper aims to explore a modified method of high-dimensional dynamic variance–covariance matrix estimation via risk factor mapping, which can yield a dependence estimation of asset returns within a large portfolio with high computational efficiency. The essence of our methodology is to express the time-varying dependence of high-dimensional return variables using the co-movement concept of returns with respect to risk factors. A novelty of the proposed methodology is to allow mapping matrices, which govern the co-movement of returns, to be time-varying. We also consider the flexible modeling of risk factors by a copula multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (MGARCH) model. Through the proposed risk factor mapping model, the number of parameters and the time complexity are functions of a small number of risk factors instead of the number of stocks in the portfolio, making our proposed methodology highly scalable. We adopt Bayesian methods to estimate unknown parameters and various risk measures in the proposed model. The proposed risk mapping method and financial applications are demonstrated by an empirical study of the Hong Kong stock market. The assessment of the effectiveness of the mapping via risk measure estimation is also discussed.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301664
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Asset selection based on high frequency Sharpe ratio,"Christina Dan Wang, Zhao Chen, Yimin Lian and Min Chen","In portfolio choice problems, the classical Mean–Variance model in Markowitz (1952) relies heavily on the covariance structure among assets. As the number and types of assets increase rapidly, traditional methods to estimate the covariance matrix and its inverse suffer from the common issues in high or ultra-high dimensional analysis. To avoid the issue of estimating the covariance matrix with high or ultra-high dimensional data, we propose a fast procedure to reduce dimension based on a new risk/return measure constructed from intra-day high frequency data and select assets via Dependent Sure Explained Variability and Independence Screening (D-SEVIS). While most feature screening methods assume i.i.d. samples, by nature of our data, we make contribution to studying D-SEVIS for samples with serial correlation, specifically, for the stationary α-mixing processes. Under α-mixing condition, we prove that D-SEVIS satisfies sure screening property and ranking consistency property. More importantly, with the assets selected through D-SEVIS, we will build a portfolio that earns more excess return compared with several existing portfolio allocation methods. We illustrate this advantage of our asset selection method with the real data from the stock market.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620302244
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Occupation density estimation for noisy high-frequency data,"Congshan Zhang, Jia Li and Tim Bollerslev","This paper studies the nonparametric estimation of occupation densities for semimartingale processes observed with noise. As leading examples we consider the stochastic volatility of a latent efficient price process, the volatility of the latent noise that separates the efficient price from the actually observed price, and nonlinear transformations of these processes. Our estimation methods are decidedly nonparametric and consist of two steps: the estimation of the spot price and noise volatility processes based on pre-averaging techniques and in-fill asymptotic arguments, followed by a kernel-type estimation of the occupation densities. Our spot volatility estimates attain the optimal rate of convergence, and are robust to leverage effects, price and volatility jumps, general forms of serial dependence in the noise, and random irregular sampling. The convergence rates of our occupation density estimates are directly related to that of the estimated spot volatilities and the smoothness of the true occupation densities. An empirical application involving high-frequency equity data illustrates the usefulness of the new methods in illuminating time-varying risks, market liquidity, and informational asymmetries across time and assets.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762030230X
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Identification of structural multivariate GARCH models,"Christian Hafner, Helmut Herwartz and Simone Maxand","The class of multivariate GARCH models is widely used to quantify and monitor volatility and correlation dynamics of financial time series. While many specifications have been proposed in the literature, these models are typically silent about the system inherent transmission of implied orthogonalized shocks to vector returns. In a framework of non-Gaussian independent structural shocks, this paper proposes a loss statistic, based on higher order co-moments, to discriminate in a data-driven way between alternative structural assumptions about the transmission scheme, and hence identify the structural model. Consistency of identification is shown theoretically and via a simulation study. In its structural form, a four dimensional system comprising US and Latin American stock market returns points to a substantial volatility transmission from the US to the Latin American markets. The identified structural model improves the estimation of classical measures of portfolio risk, as well as corresponding variations.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620302098

When the tail index α∈(1,2], it is shown that the LAD estimator asymptotically converges to a linear function of a series of α-stable random vectors with a rate of convergence n1−1/α. The result is significantly different from that of the corresponding least square estimator which is not consistent, and partially solves the problem on the asymptoticity of the LAD estimator when the tail index is less than 2.

Journal of Econometrics,2022,"Bootstrap inference on the boundary of the parameter space, with application to conditional volatility models","Giuseppe Cavaliere, Heino Bohn Nielsen, Rasmus Søndergaard Pedersen and Anders Rahbek","It is a well-established fact that – with an unknown number of nuisance parameters at the boundary – testing a null hypothesis on the boundary of the parameter space is infeasible in practice as the limiting distributions of standard test statistics are non-pivotal. In particular, likelihood ratio statistics have limiting distributions which can be characterized in terms of quadratic forms minimized over cones, where the shape of the cones depends on the unknown location of the (possibly multiple) model parameters not restricted by the null hypothesis. We propose to solve this inference problem by a novel bootstrap, which we show to be valid under general conditions, irrespective of the presence of (unknown) nuisance parameters on the boundary. That is, the new bootstrap replicates the unknown limiting distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic under the null hypothesis and is bounded (in probability) under the alternative. The new bootstrap approach, which is very simple to implement, is based on shrinkage of the parameter estimates used to generate the bootstrap sample toward the boundary of the parameter space at an appropriate rate. As an application of our general theory, we treat the problem of inference in finite-order ARCH models with coefficients subject to inequality constraints. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations illustrate that the proposed bootstrap has attractive finite sample properties both under the null and under the alternative hypothesis.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620302232

This paper introduces a simple monotonic transformation on its conditional quantile function to make the quantile regression tractable. The asymptotic normality of the resulting quantile estimators is established under either stationarity or non-stationarity. Moreover, based on the estimation procedure, new tests for strict stationarity and asymmetry are also constructed.

The matrix exponential transformation guarantees the positive definiteness of the dynamic covariance matrix. We decompose the likelihood function of the RMESV-ALM model into two components: one based on the conventional Kalman filter, and the other evaluated by a Monte Carlo likelihood technique. We consider a two-step quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for maximizing the likelihood function, and examine the finite sample properties of the estimator. The specification enables us to analyze asymmetric and higher-moment spillover effects in the covariance dynamics via news impact curves and impulse response functions. Using high frequency data for three US financial assets, the new model is estimated and evaluated. The forecasting performance of the new model is compared with a novel dynamic realized matrix-exponential conditional covariance model.

Journal of Econometrics,2022,Quantile regression methods for first-price auctions,Nathalie Gimenes and Emmanuel Guerre,"The paper proposes a quantile-regression inference framework for first-price auctions with symmetric risk-neutral bidders under the independent private-value paradigm. It is first shown that a private-value quantile regression generates a quantile regression for the bids. The private-value quantile regression can be easily estimated from the bid quantile regression and its derivative with respect to the quantile level. This also allows to test for various specification or exogeneity null hypothesis using the observed bids in a simple way. A new local polynomial technique is proposed to estimate the latter over the whole quantile level interval. Plug-in estimation of functionals is also considered, as needed for the expected revenue or the case of CRRA risk-averse bidders, which is amenable to our framework. A quantile-regression analysis to USFS timber is found more appropriate than the homogenized-bid methodology and illustrates the contribution of each explanatory variable to the private-value distribution.

The condition is equivalent to a restriction on the copula function of latent error terms. Using the monotonicity, we propose a tuning-parameter-free semiparametric estimation method and establish root n-consistency and asymptotic normality for the estimates of finite-dimensional parameters.

This makes it difficult to identify payoff primitives in the second step, which requires consistent matching of unobserved types across different values of the observed variables. Instead of imposing assumptions such as monotonicity, we address this type-matching problem by exploiting the Markov property and longitudinal variations of observables in the intermediate periods to link different decompositions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621001470

The bounds on choice set, combined with a monotonicity property derived from utility maximization, imply a system of inequality restrictions on observed choice probabilities that could be used to identify and estimate the model. A key insight is that the identification of random utility model can be achieved without exact information on consumers’ choice sets, which generalizes the identification result of the standard multinomial choice model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via a range of Monte Carlo experiments as well as an empirical application to consumer demand for potato chips using household scanner data.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621001755
Journal of Econometrics,2022,A wavelet method for panel models with jump discontinuities in the parameters,"O. Bada, A. Kneip, D. Liebl, T. Mensinger, J. Gualtieri and Robin Sickles","While a substantial literature on structural break change point analysis exists for univariate time series, research on large panel data models has not been as extensive. In this paper, a novel method for estimating panel models with multiple structural changes is proposed. The breaks are allowed to occur at unknown points in time and may affect the multivariate slope parameters individually. Our method adapts Haar wavelets to the structure of the observed variables in order to detect the change points of the parameters consistently. We also develop methods to address endogenous regressors within our modeling framework. The asymptotic property of our estimator is established. In our application, we examine the impact of algorithmic trading on standard measures of market quality such as liquidity and volatility over a time period that covers the financial meltdown that began in 2007. We are able to detect jumps in regression slope parameters automatically without using ad-hoc subsample selection criteria.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621002189
Journal of Econometrics,2022,A test of the selection on observables assumption using a discontinuously distributed covariate,Umair Khalil and Neşe Yıldız,"We present a test of the selection on observables assumption that neither requires instruments nor excluded covariates from the structural function. Instead, we rely on the presence of a discontinuously distributed variable among the set of controls. We develop formal testing procedures for a non-parametric additively separable model for binary and finite treatment variables. We also outline a nonparametric nonseparable extension. Our test is easy to implement and should be useful in many empirical settings. Specifically, we employ it to study selection concerns in the estimation of the impact of a nutritional aid program for pregnant women on birth weight.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621002451
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Inference in ordered response games with complete information,Andres Aradillas-Lopez and Adam Rosen,"We study inference in complete information games with discrete strategy spaces. Unlike binary games, we allow for rich strategy spaces and we only assume that they are ordinal in nature. We derive observable implications of equilibrium play under mild shape restrictions on payoff functions, and we characterize sharp identified sets for model parameters. We propose a novel inference method based on a test statistic that embeds conditional moment inequalities implied by equilibrium behavior. Our statistic has asymptotically pivotal properties that depend on the measure of contact sets, to which our statistic adapts automatically. In the case of two players and strategic substitutes we show that certain payoff parameters are point identified under mild conditions. We embed conventional point estimates for these parameters in our conditional moment inequality test statistic in order to perform inference on the remaining (partially identified) parameters. We apply our method to model the number of stores operated by Lowe’s and Home Depot in geographic markets and perform inference on several quantities of economic interest.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621002347
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Estimating unobserved individual heterogeneity using pairwise comparisons,"Elena Krasnokutskaya, Kyungchul Song and Xun Tang","We propose a new method for studying environments with unobserved individual heterogeneity. Based on model-implied pairwise inequalities, the method classifies individuals in the sample into groups defined by discrete unobserved heterogeneity with unknown support. We establish conditions under which the groups are identified and consistently estimated through our method. We show that the method performs well in finite samples through Monte Carlo simulation. We then apply the method to estimate a model of lowest-price procurement auctions with unobserved bidder heterogeneity, using data from the California highway procurement market.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621000142
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Feedback in panel data models,Gary Chamberlain,"Much of the analysis of panel data has been based on an assumption of strict exogeneity. Distributions are specified for outcome variables conditional on a latent individual effect and conditional on observed predictor variables at all dates, with the future values of the predictor variables assumed to have no effect on the conditional distribution. The paper relaxes this assumption in order to allow for lagged dependent variables and, more generally, for feedback from lagged dependent variables to current values of the predictor variables. Such feedback would arise in an evaluation study if the treatment variable is randomly assigned only conditional on the individual effect and on previous outcomes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621001937
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Robust likelihood estimation of dynamic panel data models,Javier Alvarez and Manuel Arellano,"We develop likelihood-based estimators for autoregressive panel data models that are consistent in the presence of time series heteroskedasticity. Bias-corrected conditional score estimators, random effects maximum likelihood in levels and first differences, and estimators that impose mean stationarity are considered for general autoregressive models with individual effects. We investigate identification under unit roots, and show that random effects estimation in levels may achieve substantial efficiency gains relative to estimation from data in differences. In an empirical application, we find evidence against unit roots in individual earnings processes from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Spanish section of the European Community Household Panel.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621000956
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Design-based analysis in Difference-In-Differences settings with staggered adoption,Susan Athey and Guido Imbens,"In this paper we study estimation of and inference for average treatment effects in a setting with panel data. We focus on the staggered adoption setting where units, e.g, individuals, firms, or states, adopt the policy or treatment of interest at a particular point in time, and then remain exposed to this treatment at all times afterwards. We take a design perspective where we investigate the properties of estimators and procedures given assumptions on the assignment process. We show that under random assignment of the adoption date the standard Difference-In-Differences (DID) estimator is an unbiased estimator of a particular weighted average causal effect. We characterize the exact finite sample properties of this estimand, and show that the standard variance estimator is conservative.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621000488
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Estimation and inference of semiparametric models using data from several sources,"Moshe Buchinsky, Fanghua Li and Zhipeng Liao","This paper studies the estimation and inference of nonlinear econometric models when the economic variables are contained in different data sets. We construct a semiparametric minimum distance (SMD) estimator of the unknown structural parameter of interest when there are some common conditioning variables in different data sets. The SMD estimator is shown to be consistent and has an asymptotic normal distribution. We provide the explicit form of the optimal weight for the SMD estimation. We provide a consistent estimator of the variance–covariance matrix of the SMD estimator, and hence inference procedures of the unknown parameter vector. The finite sample performances of the SMD estimators and the proposed inference procedures are investigated in few alternative Monte Carlo simulation studies.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621000385
Journal of Econometrics,2022,"Minimax-regret sample design in anticipation of missing data, with application to panel data",Jeff Dominitz and Charles Manski,"Missing data problems are ubiquitous in data collection. In surveys, these problems may arise from unit response, item nonresponse, and panel attrition. Building on the Dominitz and Manski (2017) study of choice between two or more sampling processes that differ in cost and quality, we study minimax-regret sample design in anticipation of missing data, where the collected data will be used for prediction under square loss of the values of functions of two variables. The analysis imposes no assumptions that restrict unobserved outcomes. Findings are reported for prediction of the values of linear and indicator functions using panel data with attrition. We also consider choice between a panel and repeated cross sections.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620304000
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Semiparametrically efficient estimation of the average linear regression function,Bryan S. Graham and Cristine Pinto,"Let Y be an outcome of interest, X a vector of treatment measures, and W a vector of pre-treatment control variables. Here X may include (combinations of) continuous, discrete, or non-mutually exclusive “treatments”. Consider the linear regression of Y onto X in a subpopulation homogeneous in W=w (formally a conditional linear predictor). Let b0w be the coefficient vector on X in this regression. We introduce a semiparametrically efficient estimate of the average β0=Eb0W. When X is binary-valued (multi-valued) our procedure recovers the (a vector of) average treatment effect(s). When X is continuously-valued, or consists of multiple non-exclusive treatments, our estimand coincides with the average partial effect (APE) of X on Y when the underlying potential response function is linear in X, but otherwise heterogeneous across agents. When the potential response function takes a general nonlinear/heterogeneous form, and X is continuously-valued, our procedure recovers a weighted average of the gradient of this response across individuals and values of X. We provide a simple, and semiparametrically efficient, method of covariate adjustment for settings with complicated treatment regimes. Our method generalizes familiar methods of covariate adjustment used for program evaluation as well as methods of semiparametric regression (e.g., the partially linear regression model).",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621001925
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Analyzing cross-validation for forecasting with structural instability,Keisuke Hirano and Jonathan Wright,"When forecasting with economic time series data, researchers often use a restricted window of observations or downweight past observations in order to mitigate the potential effects of parameter instability. In this paper, we study the problem of selecting a window for point forecasts made at the end of the sample. We develop asymptotic approximations to the sampling properties of window selection methods, and post-window selection point forecasts, where there is local parameter instability of various sorts. We examine risk properties of point forecasts made after cross-validation to select the window, and compare this approach to some alternative methods of selecting the window. We also propose a quasi-Bayesian form of cross-validation that we find to have good risk properties.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620304024
Journal of Econometrics,2022,"Who wins, who loses? Identification of conditional causal effects, and the welfare impact of changing wages",Maximilian Kasy,"The incidence of tax and other policy changes depends on their impact on equilibrium wages. In a standard model of labor supply, the impact of wage changes on a worker’s welfare equals current labor supply times the induced wage change. Worker heterogeneity implies that wage changes vary across workers. In this context, in order to identify welfare effects one needs to identify the causal effect of policy changes on wages conditional on baseline labor supply and wages.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621000452
Journal of Econometrics,2022,Approximation of sign-regular kernels,Thomas A. Knox,"Parameterized integrals, qy=∫Kx,ydPx, are common in economic applications. To optimize a parameterized integral, or to relate one such integral to others, it is helpful to reduce the rank of the kernel K while controlling approximation error. A bound on the uniform approximation error of Kx,y≈∑i=1nfixgiy also bounds the uniform approximation error of qy≈∑i=1ncigiy=∑i=1n∫fixdPxgiy over all y and all signed measures P whose total variation does not exceed a fixed bound (such as probability measures), which may be useful in optimizing q or in relating q to other parameterized integrals. Bounding the mean squared error or the local error in approximating K generally does not bound the uniform approximation error of q. Many economically interesting kernels of parameterized integrals, including expcxy, the Gaussian probability density function, and a wide class of Green’s functions, satisfy a condition known as strict sign-regularity.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621001949

In contrast to prior proposals for quantile regression estimation of censored survival models, we propose a new “data augmentation” approach to estimation. Our approach has computational advantages over earlier approaches proposed by Wu and Yin (2013, 2017). We compare our method with the two estimation strategies proposed by Wu and Yin and demonstrate its advantageous empirical performance in simulations. The methods are also illustrated with data from a Lung Cancer survival study.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620303997
