American Economic Review,2026,"""Potential"" and the Gender Promotion Gap","Alan Benson, Danielle Li and Kelly Shue","We show that subjective assessments of employee ""potential"" contribute to gender gaps in promotion and pay. Using data on 29,809 management-track employees from a large retail chain, we find that women receive substantially lower potential ratings despite receiving higher performance ratings. Differences in potential ratings account for approximately half of the gender promotion gap. Women's lower potential ratings do not reflect accurate forecasts of future performance: Women subsequently outperform male colleagues, both on average and on the margin of promotion. We highlight two mechanisms driving the gender potential gap: strategic retention and stereotyping.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220831
American Economic Review,2026,Evaluating the Impact of Urban Transit Infrastructure: Evidence from Bogotá's TransMilenio,Nick Tsivanidis,"This paper estimates the effects of improving public transit infrastructure on city structure and welfare. It develops a quantitative urban model with multiple worker groups and transit modes, and derives a special case yielding sufficient statistics for aggregate welfare in a broad class of models. The paper estimates reduced-form elasticities to implement the approach using data spanning construction of the world's largest Bus Rapid Transit system in Bogotá, Colombia. This class of models explains observed adjustments in economic activity. Standard value-of-time calculations capture only 52 percent of welfare gains. Accounting for reallocation and general equilibrium effects, distributional impacts are modest.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20190874
American Economic Review,2026,Financial Frictions: Micro versus Macro Volatility,"Renato Faccini, Seungcheol Lee, Ralph Luetticke, Morten O. Ravn and Tobias Renkin","We argue that consumer credit spreads matter for household choices and that time-varying spreads have important distributional consequences. Studying Danish household data, we show that consumer credit spreads have heterogeneous impact on asset dynamics and consumption choices across the wealth distribution and that time-varying spreads induce a countercyclical marginal propensity to consume. We study a HANK model where banks provide consumer credit and corporate loans. Through countercyclical credit spreads, frictional finance amplifies aggregate shocks and induces consumption inequality. Economies with less leveraged banks experience reduced aggregate volatility but may face higher volatility and lower welfare at the household level.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211219
American Economic Review,2026,Raising the Stakes: Physician Facility Investments and Provider Agency,"Elizabeth L. Munnich, Michael R. Richards, Christopher M. Whaley and Xiaoxi Zhao","Principal-agent problems often extend beyond what can be directly addressed through conventional incentive arrangements. We examine a context where physicians are likely under-incentivized to minimize total medical costs until their private financial interests align with those of patients. Leveraging novel data on physician ownership of ambulatory surgery centers—that is, same-day facilities—we show that these equity holdings cause a substitution away from higher cost, rival settings that lowers Medicare spending by 10–40 percent per physician. We find no clear evidence of perverse behavior following these investments. Instead, our findings demonstrate how entrepreneurial activity can indirectly limit principal-agent problems and improve efficiency.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211324
American Economic Review,2026,Competition under Incomplete Contracts and the Design of Procurement Policies,"Rodrigo Carril, Andres Gonzalez-Lira and Michael S. Walker","We study the effects of intensifying competition for contracts in the context of US Defense procurement. Leveraging a discontinuous regulation that mandates agencies to publicize certain contract opportunities, we document that expanding the set of bidders reduces award prices but deteriorates post-award performance in terms of cost overruns and delays. We develop and estimate an auction model with endogenous entry and stochastic execution performance, in which the buyer endogenously chooses the intensity of competition. Model estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in performance across contractors and show that simple adjustments to the current regulation could provide significant savings in procurement spending.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221345
American Economic Review,2026,Take the Goods and Run: Contracting Frictions and Market Power in Supply Chains,Felipe Brugués,"This paper studies the efficiency of self-enforced relational agreements, a common solution to contracting frictions, when sellers have market power and contracts cannot be externally enforced. To this end, I develop a dynamic contracting model with limited enforcement in which buyers can default on their trade credit debt and estimate it using a novel dataset from the Ecuadorian manufacturing supply chain. The key empirical finding is that bilateral trade is inefficiently low in early periods of the relationship, but converges toward efficiency over time, despite sellers' market power. Counterfactual simulations imply that both market power and enforcement contribute to inefficiencies in trade.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230264
American Economic Review,2026,Consumer Credit and the Incidence of Tariffs: Evidence from the Auto Industry,"Kristine W. Hankins, Morteza Momeni and David Sovich","Captive finance subsidiaries create a channel for trade policy to affect consumer credit. Examining the impact of the Trump administration's metal tariffs on captive automobile lenders, we find that consumers received higher interest rates from captive lenders after the tariffs relative to unaffected noncaptive lenders. Further, we document a disparate impact on low-income borrowers and in areas with less lending competition. Our results suggest that tariffs may impact not only the price of goods but also the financing terms of purchases. Thus, focusing solely on directly affected product prices may underestimate tariff pass-through significantly.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230432
American Economic Review,2026,Work from Home and the Office Real Estate Apocalypse,"Arpit Gupta, Vrinda Mittal and Stijn  Van Nieuwerburgh","We show remote work led to large drops in lease revenues, occupancy, and market rents in the commercial office sector. We revalue New York City office buildings, taking into account both the cash flow and discount rate implications of these shocks, and find a 46 percent decline in long-run value. For all US office markets combined, we find a $556.8 billion value destruction. Higher-quality buildings were buffered against these trends due to a flight to quality, while lower-quality offices are at risk of becoming a stranded asset. These valuation changes have repercussions for financial stability and local public finances.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231619
American Economic Review,2026,A Theory of Supply Function Choice and Aggregate Supply,"Joel P. Flynn, George Nikolakoudis and Karthik A. Sastry","Modern theories of aggregate supply are built on the foundation that firms set prices and commit to producing whatever the market demands. We remove this strategic restriction and allow firms to choose supply functions, mappings that describe the prices charged at each quantity of production. Theoretically, we characterize firms' optimal supply function choices in general equilibrium and study the resulting implications for aggregate supply. Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240443
American Economic Review,2026,Gender Differences in Economics Seminars,"Pascaline Dupas, Amy Handlan, Alicia Sasser Modestino, Muriel Niederle, Mateo Seré, Haoyu Sheng, Justin Wolfers and Seminar Dynamics Collective","We assess whether men and women are treated differently when presenting their economics research. We collected data across thousands of seminars, job market talks, and conference presentations, leveraging human judgment and audio-processing algorithms to measure the number, tone, and type of interruptions. Within a seminar series, women are interrupted more than men. This holds when controlling for characteristics of the presenter, paper, and audience. Interruptions that are negative in tenor or tone or cut off the presenter mid-sentence increase for women presenters. We also find greater engagement of female audience members with female presenters, suggesting a potential role model effect.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20241718
American Economic Review,2026,The Opportunity Atlas: Mapping the Childhood Roots of Social Mobility,"Raj Chetty, John N. Friedman, Nathaniel Hendren, Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter","We construct a public atlas of mean outcomes in adulthood by childhood census tract. Outcomes vary sharply across neighborhoods: For children whose parents earn $27,000, the standard deviation of mean household income in adulthood is $10,420 across tracts within counties. Only half the variation in outcomes is explained by traditional measures of neighborhood opportunity like poverty rates. Experimental and quasi-experimental estimates indicate 60 percent of the variation in outcomes across neighborhoods is driven by causal effects. We demonstrate how our statistics can be applied to better target policies to improve low-opportunity areas and help families move to affordable high-opportunity areas.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20200108
American Economic Review,2026,Across-Country Wage Compression in Multinationals,"Jonas Hjort, Xuan Li and Heather Sarsons","Many employers link wages at establishments outside of the home region to the level at headquarters. We show this using new data on 1,200 multinationals' establishments across the world and linked employee-level data on their establishments in Brazil. Headquarters wage changes arising from minimum wage and exchange rate shocks are partially transmitted to workers employed in the same position abroad. Wage change transmission appears to be direct and results from firm-wide wage-setting procedures rather than associated technology or employment changes. ""Anchored"" wage setting is somewhat associated with particular characteristics of the job × employer × headquarters-establishment country-pair.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20200042
American Economic Review,2026,Risk Preferences and Field Behavior: The Relevance of Higher-Order Risk Preferences,Sebastian Schneider and Matthias Sutter,"Using new methods, we measure the intensities of higher-order risk preferences (prudence and temperance) in an incentivized experiment with 658 adolescents. Aligned with theory, we find that higher-order risk preferences are strongly related to field behavior, including prevention, health, addictive behavior, and financial decision-making. Most importantly, we show that ignoring prudence and temperance can yield misleading conclusions about the relation of risk preferences to field behavior, and that survey measures of risk tolerance often relate to field behavior because they capture higher-order risk preferences.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211217
American Economic Review,2026,Optimal Taxation and Market Power,"Jan Eeckhout, Chunyang Fu, Wenjian Li and Xi Weng","Should optimal income taxation change when firms have market power? We analyze how the planner can optimally tax labor income of workers and profits of entrepreneurs. We derive optimal tax rates that depend on markups and identify four distinct components: the Mirrleesian incentive effect, the Pigouvian tax correction of the negative externality of market power, redistribution through altered factor prices, and reallocation of output toward the most productive firms. We quantify the optimal tax for the US economy and provide concrete proposals how to use income taxation to redistribute income while incentivizing production in the presence of market power.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211445
American Economic Review,2026,Monetary Cooperation during Global Inflation Surges,Luca Fornaro and Federica Romei,"We study optimal monetary policy during times of global scarcity of tradable goods. The optimal monetary response entails a surge in inflation, which helps rebalance production toward the tradable sector. While the inflation costs are fully borne domestically, however, the gains in terms of higher supply of tradable goods partly spill over to the rest of the world. National central banks may thus fall into a coordination trap and implement an excessively tight monetary policy causing an unnecessarily sharp global contraction.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231018
American Economic Review,2026,Monotonicity among Judges: Evidence from Judicial Panels and Consequences for Judge IV Designs,Henrik Sigstad,"Judge IV designs rely on monotonicity—each judge being weakly stricter than more lenient judges in all cases. I measure monotonicity in judicial panels in five different settings and find that it is violated in up to 50 percent of nonunanimous cases. The monotonicity violations are not detected by conventional tests, but they would typically induce little bias in judge IV estimates.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231104
American Economic Review,2026,Sequential Learning under Informational Ambiguity,Jaden Yang Chen,"This paper investigates a sequential social learning problem in which individuals face ambiguity about others' signal structures and have max-min expected utility preferences, thereby exhibiting ambiguity aversion. Unlike previous findings, which suggest that learning outcomes depend on the specifics of the learning environment, this study establishes information cascades as a robust outcome under ambiguity. With sufficient ambiguity, cascades arise almost surely, regardless of the statistical properties of signal structures. Moreover, standard results predicting the absence of cascades can easily break down: Even minimal ambiguity can trigger cascades when signals are bounded and lead to incorrect herding when signals are unbounded.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231394
American Economic Review,2026,Gender-Biased Technological Change: Milking Machines and the Exodus of Women from Farming,"Philipp Ager, Marc Goñi and Kjell G. Salvanes","This paper studies how gender-biased technological change in agriculture affected women's work in twentieth-century Norway. In the 1950s, dairy farms began widely adopting milking machines to replace milking cows by hand, a task typically performed by young women. We show that the machines pushed rural young women in dairy-intensive areas out of farming. The displaced women moved to cities where they acquired more education and found better-paying, skilled employment. Our results suggest that the adoption of milking machines broke up allocative inefficiencies associated with moving costs across sectors, which improved the economic status of women relative to men.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240167
American Economic Review,2026,Racial Disparities in Housing Returns,Amir Kermani and Francis Wong,"We show that higher rates of distressed home sales (i.e., foreclosures and short sales) among Black and Hispanic homeowners severely reduce realized housing returns for these groups—in particular, to a level below that realized by White homeowners. Yet absent financial distress, houses owned by minorities do not appreciate at substantially slower rates than houses owned by nonminorities. Racial differences in liquidity and income stability, which are imperfectly observed by lenders, are important determinants of differences in distress. Policies that prevent foreclosure among distressed minorities can mitigate the racial gap in returns.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240327
American Economic Review,2026,Tying with Network Effects,"Jay Pil Choi, Doh-Shin Jeon and Michael D. Whinston","We develop a leverage theory of tying in markets with network effects. When a monopolist in one market cannot perfectly extract surplus from consumers, tying can be a mechanism through which unexploited consumer surplus is used as a demand-side leverage to create a ""quasi-installed base"" advantage in another market characterized by network effects. Our mechanism does not require any precommitment to tying; rather, tying emerges as a best response that lowers the quality of tied-market rivals. While tying can lead to exclusion of tied-market rivals, it can also expand use of the tying product, leading to ambiguous welfare effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240461
