Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Customer data access and fintech entry: Early evidence from open banking,"Tania Babina, Saleem Bahaj, Greg Buchak, Filippo De Marco, Angus Foulis, Will Gornall, Francesco Mazzola and Tong Yu","Open banking (OB) empowers bank customers to share their financial transaction data with fintechs and other banks. New cross-country data shows 49 countries adopted OB policies, privacy preferences predict policy adoption, and adoption spurs fintech entry. UK microdata shows that OB enables: (i) consumers to access both financial advice and credit; (ii) SMEs to establish new lending relationships. In a calibrated model, OB universally improves welfare through entry and product improvements when used for advice. When used for credit, OB promotes entry and competition by reducing adverse selection, but higher prices for costlier or privacy-conscious consumers partially offset these benefits.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001739
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,"LTCM Redux? Hedge fund Treasury trading, funding fragility, and risk constraints","Mathias S. Kruttli, Phillip J. Monin, Lubomir Petrasek and Sumudu W. Watugala","We exploit the 2020 Treasury market shock to analyze how external and internal constraints impact arbitrageurs. Using regulatory filings, we find that hedge funds reduced arbitrage activities and increased cash holdings, despite stable credit and low contemporaneous redemptions. Creditors’ regulatory and liquidity constraints were not propagated to hedge funds through repo—Treasury arbitrageurs’ predominant financing source. Fund-creditor borrowing data reveal more regulated dealers provided, and more important clients received, disproportionately higher funding. Value-at-risk reported by funds suggests internal risk constraints were binding. Our results support theoretical predictions that arbitrageur risk constraints and precautionary liquidity management can amplify market instability even when contemporaneous financing remains resilient.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2500025X
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Innovation and capital,"Daniel C. Fehder, Naomi Hausman and Yael V. Hochberg","Using a regime change in the commercialization of university innovation in 1980 that strongly increased university incentives to patent and license discoveries, we document that an increase in the supply of commercializable innovation attracts venture capital investment to the region. The Bayh-Dole Act shifted ownership of intellectual property stemming from federally-funded research from the federal government to universities, spurring technology transfer into the local area. Because universities have different technological strengths, each local area surrounding a university experienced an increase after 1980 in commercializable innovation relevant to particular sets of industries which differed widely across university counties. Comparing industries within a county that were more versus less related to the local university's innovative strengths, we show that venture capital dollars after 1980 flowed systematically towards geographic areas and industries affected most by the sudden influx of commercializable innovation from universities. These results persist even when controlling for ex ante geographic and industry distributions of corporate patenting and prior venture financing. The findings support the notion that increased supply of commercializable innovation serves to draw private capital investment to a region.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000376
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Payments and privacy in the digital economy,"Toni Ahnert, Peter Hoffmann and Cyril Monnet","We propose a model of lending, payments choice, and privacy in the digital economy. While digital payments enable merchants to sell goods online, they reveal information to their lender. Cash guarantees anonymity, but limits distribution to less efficient offline venues. In equilibrium, merchants trade off the efficiency gains from online distribution (with digital payments) and the informational rents from staying anonymous (with cash). While new technologies can reduce the privacy concerns associated with digital payments, they also redistribute surplus from the lender to merchants. Hence, privacy enhancements do not always improve welfare.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000583

Markups cannot measure competition, because most data products’ marginal cost is zero, making the markup infinite. Yet, data monopolists may not exert monopoly power because they cannot commit to restricting data sales to future customers. This limited commitment and strategic substitutability of data undermine sellers’ monopoly power. But data subscriptions restore this monopoly power. Evidence from online data markets supports the model’s insight that subscriptions indicate market power. Model and evidence reveal that data subscriptions are better for consumers because they sustain the incentive to invest in high-quality data.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000613
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Collateral value uncertainty and mortgage credit provision,Erica Xuewei Jiang and Anthony Lee Zhang,"Houses with higher value uncertainty receive less mortgage credit: mortgages backed by these houses are more likely to be rejected, have higher interest rates, and have lower loan-to-price ratios. The relationship between house value uncertainty and credit availability is driven partly by a classic channel in which uncertainty lowers debt recovery rates, and partly by a novel channel where more uncertain appraisals make regulatory constraints on loan size more likely to bind. We build a structural model to quantify the effects of each channel, and show how a shift toward computerized asset appraisals could influence credit access.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000625

Using data from the UK mortgage market and a structural model of screening with endogenous menus, this paper quantifies the impact of asymmetric information on equilibrium contracts and welfare. Counterfactual simulations show that, because of the externality, there is too much screening along the loan-to-value dimension. The deadweight loss, expressed in borrower utility, is equivalent to an interest rate increase of 30 basis points (a 15% increase) on all loans.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000649
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,The return of return dominance: Decomposing the cross-section of prices,"Ricardo Delao, Xiao Han and Sean Myers","What explains cross-sectional dispersion in stock valuation ratios? We find that 75% of dispersion in price–earnings ratios is reflected in differences in future returns, while only 25% is reflected in differences in future earnings growth. This holds at both the portfolio-level and the firm-level. We reconcile these conclusions with previous literature which has found a strong relation between prices and future profitability. Our results support models in which the cross-section of price–earnings ratios is driven mainly by discount rates or mispricing rather than future earnings growth. Evaluating six models of the value premium, we find that most models struggle to match our results; however, models with long-lived differences in risk exposure or gradual learning about parameters perform the best. The lack of earnings growth differences at long horizons provides new evidence in favor of long-run return predictability. We also show a similar dominance of predicted returns for explaining the dispersion in return surprises.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000674

Capital regulation addresses banks’ incentive for excessive leverage that dilutes depositors, but preserves some dilution to reduce bank defaults. We show theoretically that capital regulation is subject to a time inconsistency problem. In a model with non-maturing deposits where optimal withdrawals make deposits endogenously long-term, we find commitment to have important effects on the optimal level and cyclicality of capital adequacy. Our results call for a systematic framework that limits capital regulators’ discretion.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000686
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Trust as an entry barrier: Evidence from FinTech adoption,Keer Yang,"This paper studies the role of trust in incumbent lenders (banks) as an entry barrier to emerging FinTech lenders in credit markets. The empirical setting exploits the outbreak of the Wells Fargo scandal as a negative shock to borrowers’ trust in banks. Using a difference-in-differences framework, I find that increased exposure to the Wells Fargo scandal leads to an increase in the probability of borrowers using FinTech as mortgage originators. Utilizing political affiliation to proxy for the magnitude of trust erosion in banks in a triple-differences specification, I find that, conditional on the same exposure to the scandal, a county experiencing a greater erosion of trust has a larger increase in FinTech share relative to a county experiencing less of an erosion of trust. Estimating treatment effect heterogeneity using generic machine learning inference suggests that borrowers with the greatest decrease in trust in banks and the greatest increase in FinTech adoption have similar characteristics.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000704

Late-2002 court rulings prevented public LPs from providing confidentiality to investment managers. The best-performing VCs, but not other managers, responded by excluding public LPs from their new funds. Lost access reduced public LP returns by $1.6 billion relative to $14 billion of their VC commitments. Legislation reducing disclosure, contracts limiting information access, and added fund-of-funds intermediaries helped restore access. These changes focused on protecting portfolio company information, highlighting the importance of proprietary information for VC investing and the potential costs of transparency.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000716
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Global volatility and firm-level capital flows,"Marcin Kacperczyk, Jaromir Nosal and Tianyu Wang","We study the impact of global volatility on the equity portfolio flows of institutional investors worldwide. Aggregate equity allocations of institutional investors decrease during periods of high volatility, both in developed and, even more strongly, in emerging markets. Our granular portfolio-level data allows us to uncover disaggregated investor responses that are an order of magnitude larger than aggregate estimates, and are dominated by discretionary (investor-driven) component of flows. We further show that periods of high volatility are associated with portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors from small-cap to large-cap stocks. Finally, institutional flows have significant impact on future firm stability, measured by their volatility and liquidity. Our findings are consistent with the economic mechanism in which investors with heterogeneous information capacity are learning about assets with different information rents.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000868

We evaluate the quality of benchmark prices using a state-space model to separate information from noise. Applying the method to LIBOR benchmarks and their replacements, we find that alternative reference rates (ARRs) are less noisy in four of the five currencies. However, the USD ARR is considerably more noisy, resulting in billions of dollars of noise-related wealth transfers between contract counterparties.

When bad macro news arrives (in our study, when initial jobless claims (IJC) are higher than expected), investors may expect more generous government spending and drive up aggregate stock prices through the expected cash flow channel. Using a time-series sample from January 2013 to March 2021, we find that this phenomenon emerges when newspapers mention fiscal policy more. In the cross section, firms expected to receive more government spending – through stimulus supports during COVID-19 or procurement contracts before 2020 – exhibit higher individual stock returns when bad IJC shocks arrive.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000455
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Can everyone tap into the housing piggy bank? Racial disparities in access to home equity,"James N. Conklin, Kristopher Gerardi and Lauren Lambie-Hanson","We document large racial disparities in the ability of homeowners to access their accumulated housing wealth. Minority homeowners are significantly more likely to have their mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) product applications rejected than White homeowners, and the unconditional disparities are significantly larger than those found in prior studies that focused on purchase and rate/term refinance loans. Had Black homeowners faced the same MEW denial rate as White homeowners in our sample period we show they would have extracted an additional $11.2 billion in housing equity, or almost 25% of the total amount of actual equity extracted. Controlling for key underwriting variables significantly narrows the racial disparities, with the Black–White gap falling by nearly 85%, and the Hispanic-White gap falling by more than 75%. Credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are the most important factors explaining the gaps, while differences in loan-to-value ratios contribute only modestly. “Residual” disparities after conditioning on observable underwriting factors are large and vary significantly across lenders. A battery of tests suggests that differences in unobserved underwriting factors are unlikely to fully explain the residual disparities, which tend to be larger in geographic areas characterized by more racial animus.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000467
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,"Investor demand, firm investment, and capital misallocation","Jaewon Choi, Xu Tian, Yufeng Wu and Mahyar Kargar","Fluctuations in investor demand significantly affect firms’ valuation and access to capital. To quantify their real effects, we develop a dynamic investment model, incorporating both the demand and supply sides of capital. Strong investor demand relaxes financial constraints and facilitates equity issuance and investment, while weak demand encourages opportunistic share repurchases, crowding out investment. We estimate the model using indirect inference, matching the endogenous relationship between investor demand and firm policies. Our estimation reveals that demand fluctuations are important drivers of firm-level investment and economy-wide capital misallocation, accounting for 26.9% of dispersion in MPK and 23.4% of productivity losses.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000479
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,"Fintech entry, lending market competition, and welfare",Xavier Vives and Zhiqiang Ye,"We provide a spatial framework to study competition between banks and fintechs in the lending market and examine the impact on investment and welfare. Based on the key differences between banks and fintechs, we derive results consistent with the empirical evidence available. We find that fintechs with inferior monitoring efficiency can successfully enter because of their superior flexibility in pricing and that higher bank concentration leads to higher fintech loan volume. If fintechs and banks have similar funding costs, fintech borrowers pay lower loan rates and have higher default rates than bank borrowers with similar characteristics; however, the result will flip if fintechs have much higher funding costs than banks. The advantage of fintechs in offering convenience can also induce them to charge higher loan rates than banks. Fintech entry will improve welfare if fintechs have high monitoring efficiency and inter-fintech competition intensity is intermediate. Fintech entry may induce banks’ exit and reduce investment; however, it will increase investment if inter-fintech competition is intense enough.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000480

Wholesaler concentration has raised regulatory concerns; however, we show that the largest wholesalers offer the lowest costs due to economies of scale. The entry of a new large wholesaler reduces incumbent scale economies, resulting in higher execution costs. Most retail brokers route to multiple wholesalers and actively monitor their performance, rewarding those offering lower execution costs with more volume.

We take global investor savings, asset supply, and monetary policy as exogenous primitives, and show how these variables explain dollar exchange rate behavior. Prior to the global financial crisis, global savings and demand shifts explain dollar depreciation, whereas post-crisis they explain dollar appreciation. Interest rates and cross-border bank loans explain short-term fluctuations in the dollar, but decline in significance over longer horizons. When explaining the dollar factor structure, we find that global savings explain common variations across dollar exchange rates, whereas investor demand shifts account for cross-sectional heterogeneity in dollar betas.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000601

Countries digitize their currencies–by upgrading existing or launching new payment systems (including CBDCs)–to compete with foreign fiat currencies and private digital money. A pecking order emerges: less dominant currencies digitize earlier, reflecting a first-mover advantage; dominant currencies delay digitization until they face competition; the weakest currencies forgo digitization. However, delayed digitization allows private digital money to gain widespread adoption, eventually weakening fiat money’s role.

We analyze detailed transaction data from a large brokerage firm to provide direct field evidence that individual investors also exhibit this behavior. Consistent with models of portfolio choice with labor income, reaching for yield is more pronounced among younger and less-wealthy individuals. Consistent with prospect theory, reaching for yield is more pronounced when investors are trading at a loss.

Exploiting the ECB's tiered reserve remuneration system for identification, we show that this system encouraged banks with low reserve holdings to obtain more reserves through the money market.

Testing this implication is difficult in practice, as it requires noisy high-frequency data from after-hours markets, where most earnings announcements are released. Using a unique dataset and a new microstructure noise-robust jump test, we show that earnings announcements almost always induce jumps in the stock price of announcing firms. They also significantly raise the probability of price co-jumps in non-announcing firms and the market.

Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Expected idiosyncratic volatility,"Geert Bekaert, Mikael Bergbrant and Haimanot Kassa","We use close to 80 million daily returns for more than 19,000 CRSP listed firms to establish the best forecasting model for realized idiosyncratic variances. Comparing forecasts from multiple models, we find that the popular martingale model performs worst. Using the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) to judge model performance, ARMA(1,1) models perform the best for about 46% of the firms in out-of-sample tests. The ARMA(1,1) model delivers an average RMSE that is statistically significantly lower than all alternative models, and also performs well when not the very best. Its forecasts reverse large, unexpected shocks to realized variances. When using this model to revisit the relation between idiosyncratic risk and returns (the IVOL puzzle), we fail to find a significant relation. The IVOL puzzle is closely connected to a very small set of observations where the martingale forecast over-predicts the future realized variance. These extreme observations are correlated with well-known firm characteristics associated with the IVOL puzzle such as poor liquidity as measured by high bid-ask spreads and the “MAX” effect.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000315

Under the mean–variance efficient framework, P-Trees construct test assets that significantly advance the efficient frontier compared to commonly used test assets, with alphas unexplained by benchmark pricing models. P-Tree tangency portfolios also constitute traded factors, recovering the pricing kernel and outperforming popular observable and latent factor models for investments and cross-sectional pricing.

Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Intermediary financing without commitment,Yunzhi Hu and Felipe Varas,"Intermediaries reduce agency problems through monitoring, but credible monitoring requires sufficient retention until the loan matures. We study credit markets when intermediaries cannot commit to retention. Two structures are examined: investors lending alongside an all-equity bank and investors lending through the bank via short-term debt. With a commitment to retention, they are equivalent. Without commitment, the all-equity bank sells loans and reduces monitoring over time. Short-term debt encourages the intermediary to retain loans and incentivizes monitoring. Our analysis provides a novel mechanism for intermediaries’ reliance on short-term debt—the constant repricing of debt creates incentives that resolve the commitment problem in loan retention and monitoring.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000339

Analyzing an exchange economy with credit, we show that centralized updating is optimal when long-term rewards are more valued, minimizing redundant validation costs and maximizing economic surplus. Decentralization becomes preferable under weaker intertemporal incentives and when validators are drawn from market participants.

Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Back to the 1980s or not? The drivers of inflation and real risks in Treasury bonds,Carolin Pflueger,"This paper shows that supply shock uncertainty interacts with the monetary policy rule to drive bond risks in a New Keynesian asset pricing model. In my model, positive nominal bond-stock betas emerge as the result of volatile supply shocks but only if the monetary policy rule features a high inflation weight. Habit formation preferences generate endogenously time-varying risk premia, explaining the volatility and predictability of bond and stock excess returns in the data, and implying that bond-stock betas price the expected equilibrium mix of shocks rather than realized shocks. The model explains the change from positive nominal and real bond-stock betas in the 1980s to negative nominal and real bond-stock betas in the 2000s with a shift from dominant supply shocks and an inflation-focused monetary policy rule, to demand shocks in the 2000s.

Drawing on a globally representative data set of currency trading volumes, we show that at times when dealers’ intermediation capacity is constrained the cost of liquidity provision increases disproportionately relative to dealer-intermediated volume. Consequently, the otherwise strong and positive relation between liquidity costs and trading volume diminishes significantly when dealers face tighter Value-at-Risk limits or higher funding costs. Using various econometric approaches, we show that this nonlinear effect of dealer constraints on market liquidity primarily stems from a reduction in the elasticity of liquidity supply, rather than changes in liquidity demand.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000364

These effects are robust to the degree of sophistication of agents regarding their future biases.

On the financial side, firms paid out only about one-third of the new liquidity to shareholders and retained half as cash. This high retention was not associated with poor governance.

We measure the S&L crisis exposure by the bank failure rate in the states where CEOs worked during the S&L crisis. Armed with this measure, we find that banks managed by CEOs with higher S&L crisis exposure took on less risk and that these banks better survived the financial crisis of 2008. In particular, CEOs adjusted risk attitudes in areas causing the S&L crisis: their more intense crisis experience reduced banks’ interest rate risk, exposure to risky financial innovation and credit risk.

Journal of Financial Economics,2025,The impact of bank financing on municipalities’ bond issuance and the real economy,Ramona Dagostino,Do federal tax incentives for banks investing in municipal bonds support local governments during recessions? This paper exploits a change in tax benefits for banks purchasing municipal bonds and finds that expanding access to bank financing during recessions increases local governments’ debt issuance and employment growth. The estimated job multiplier is 22 jobs per million dollars of spending. There is moderate evidence of mortgage loans being crowded out by banks’ increased holdings of municipal bonds.,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000303

Mismatching is high at the beginning of our sample (45 % of TNA in 2008), consistent with prior studies, but declines significantly over time (27 % in 2020), driven by existing specialized funds changing benchmarks to match their style. Market forces including investor learning, institutional governance, market competition, and product positioning all play a role in benchmark correction decisions. For funds with difficult to categorize investment strategies, mismatched benchmarks are less associated with performance bias. Our study highlights the value of market solutions in aligning manager-investor interests.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001983

We study this question using a short-term equity asset that entitles the owner to the near-term dividends of the aggregate stock market. We develop a stylized model of monetary policy and the equity term structure and derive tests of Fed information effects using the short-term asset announcement return. Consistent with the existence of information effects, we find that the short-term asset return in a 30-minute window around FOMC announcements loads positively on monetary policy surprises.

We explain these industry polarization trends in an estimated general equilibrium model where each industry consists of large superstar oligopolists and small monopolistically competitive firms with endogenous transitions between them. Small firms make investments in speculative innovation to increase their probability of becoming superstars. Our model estimation finds that rising entry barriers in both small and superstar firms contribute to rising polarization in markups, but the rising barriers to creating small firms and increasing tastes for goods produced by superstars account for most of the divergence in Q. Stunting the creation of small firms generates greater incentives for speculative innovation, magnifying the impact of market power dispersion on industry polarization in Q.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24002137

ESG policies are pledges made by firms that constrain managers to treat their stakeholders better than market conditions alone dictate. Moderate policies limit market power and prompt managers to be more competitive; aggressive polices backfire, both for adopting firms and intended beneficiaries. In contrast to the “shareholder primacy” paradigm, competition in ESG policies under the “stakeholder capitalism” paradigm is a panacea for market power, delivering the first-best outcome in equilibrium.

This effect is particularly pronounced during periods of UK bond issuance and is linked to higher term premia. Financial intermediary constraints play a role as dealers avoid accumulating inventory in pre-news windows following issuance.

Abnormal returns and Sharpe ratios of betting-against-beta (BAB) factors rise following months with below-median realized volatility, even controlling for mispricing, limits to arbitrage, lottery preferences, analyst disagreement, and sentiment. Moreover, the leverage constraints theory counterfactually predicts that market and BAB Sharpe ratios increase with volatility. We further show that institutional investors shift their demand from high- to low-beta stocks as volatility increases, and the resulting price impact is sufficient to explain the difference in abnormal BAB returns between high- and low-volatility states.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000029

Belief dispersion relates to expected equity and debt returns in opposite directions. Similarly, expected debt (equity) returns typically increase (decrease) with default risk, though these relationships reverse for firms close to bankruptcy.

When households have homogeneous present bias, β, the social optimum is well approximated by a single account with an early-withdrawal penalty of 1−β.

When calibrated to current data, we demonstrate that the impact on the cost of capital is too small to meaningfully affect real investment decisions. We then derive the conditions that would be required for the strategy to have a meaningful impact. We empirically corroborate our theoretical results by studying firm changes in ESG status and are unable to detect an impact of ESG divestiture strategies on the cost of capital of treated firms. Our results suggest that to have impact, instead of divesting, socially conscious investors should invest and exercise their rights of control to change corporate policy.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001958

We show mobility rates fell in 2022 and 2023 for homeowners with mortgages, as market rates rose. We observe both absolute declines and declines relative to homeowners without mortgages, who are unaffected by mortgage rate lock. Mobility declines are not explained by changes in home values.

The survey elicits investors’ expectations of long-term ESG equity returns and asks about their motivations, if any, to invest in ESG assets. We document four facts. First, investors generally expected ESG investments to underperform the market. Between mid-2021 and late-2023, the average expected 10-year annualized return of ESG investments relative to the overall stock market was −2.1%. Second, there is substantial heterogeneity across investors in their ESG return expectations and their motives for ESG investing: 48% of survey respondents do not see any reason to invest in ESG, 24% are primarily motivated by ethical considerations, 22% are driven by climate hedging motives, and 6% are motivated by return expectations. Third, there is a strong link between individuals’ reported ESG investment motives and their actual investment behaviors, with the highest ESG portfolio holdings among individuals who report ethics-driven investment motives. Fourth, financial considerations matter independently of other investment motives: we find meaningful ESG holdings only for investors who expect these investments to outperform the market, even among those investors who reported that their most important ESG investment motives were ethical or hedging reasons.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24002071

Increased salience in fee disclosure raises the drop rate for advice, implying improved attention — particularly for relatively sophisticated investors. However, a novel auto-drop requirement for inattentive investors generates far more drops, implying limited attention despite salient disclosure — particularly for the unsophisticated. Contrary to studies of commission-based advice, we find that investors benefit from fee-based advice. Benefits are higher for less sophisticated investors, who tend to be detrimentally auto-dropped.

This approach allows us to measure extrapolation bias without having to rely on survey data, and it inherently guarantees that the researcher focuses on a set of beliefs that matter for price formation. We show that extrapolative beliefs extracted from prices are highly correlated with surveys and that survey-based and price-based extrapolative beliefs share similar predictive properties for future returns, with the former improving upon the latter.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24002095
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Biodiversity finance,"Caroline Flammer, Thomas Giroux and Geoffrey Heal","We study biodiversity finance—the use of private capital to finance biodiversity conservation and restoration—which is a new practice in sustainable finance. First, we provide a conceptual framework that lays out how biodiversity can be financed by pure private capital and blended financing structures. In the latter, private capital is blended with public or philanthropic capital, whose aim is to de-risk private capital investments. The main element underlying both types of financing is the “monetization” of biodiversity, that is, using investments in biodiversity to generate a financial return for private investors. Second, we provide empirical evidence using deal-level data from a leading biodiversity finance institution. Our findings are consistent with a three-dimensional efficient frontier (return, risk, and biodiversity impact)—deals with a favorable risk-return profile tend to be financed by pure private capital, whereas for other deals the biodiversity impact needs to be sufficiently large for blended finance to be used. Overall, our results suggest that blended finance is an important tool for improving the risk-return profile of these projects, thereby increasing their appeal to private investors and crowding in private capital. Finally, our results suggest that private capital is unlikely to substitute for effective public policies in addressing the biodiversity crisis.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24002101

Management plays a key role in job-worker matching: when managerial hirings and firings persistently raise management quality, the matching of rank-and-file workers to their jobs improves.

We first show that the private market provision of ESG funds marketed to retail investors involves greenwashing, so that a mandatory taxonomy is necessary to generate real effects of sustainable finance. However, the introduction of such a taxonomy can only improve welfare, on top of optimally chosen environmental regulation, if financial frictions constrain socially valuable economic activity.

Journal of Financial Economics,2025,The moral preferences of investors: Experimental evidence,"Jean-François Bonnefon, Augustin Landier, Parinitha Sastry and David Thesmar","We characterize investors’ moral preferences in a parsimonious experimental setting, where we auction stocks with various ethical features. We find strong evidence that investors seek to align their investments with their social values (“value alignment”), and find no evidence of behavior driven by the social impact of investment decisions (“impact-seeking preferences”). First, the willingness to pay (WTP) for a stock is an increasing and quasi-linear function of corporate externalities. Second, this WTP does not change when corporate externalities are made contingent on investors buying the auctioned stock. Our results are thus compatible with a utility-maximization model where non-pecuniary benefits of firms’ externalities only accrue through stock ownership, not through the actual impact of investment decisions. Finally, the ability to directly contribute to the externality (by donating) does not reduce the willingness to pay for virtuous stocks.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001788

The effects of an IT improvement depend on whether it weakens the influence of lender–borrower distance on monitoring costs. If it does, it has a hump-shaped effect on entrepreneurs’ investment and social welfare. If not, competition intensity does not vary, improving lender profits, entrepreneurs’ investment, and social welfare. When entrepreneurs’ moral hazard problem is severe, IT-induced competition is more likely to reduce investment and welfare. We also find that lenders’ price discrimination is not welfare-optimal.

The effect is more pronounced for employees with longer tenure, as they were newly exposed to greater unemployment risk.

By doing so, the coarsely informed investor invites the other investor to trade against his information, thereby reducing his price impact. Paradoxically, the well informed investor loses from receiving information because of the resulting worsened market liquidity and the more aggressive trading by the coarsely informed investor.
