The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,"Factorial Designs, Model Selection, and (Incorrect) Inference in Randomized Experiments","Karthik Muralidharan, Mauricio Romero and Kaspar Wüthrich","Factorial designs are widely used to study multiple treatments in one experiment. Although t-tests using a fully saturated “long model provide valid inferences, “short model t-tests (that ignore interactions) yield higher power if interactions are zero, but incorrect inferences otherwise. Of 27 factorial experiments published in top-five journals (2007–2017), nineteen use the short model. After including interactions, more than half of their results lose significance. Based on recent econometric advances, we show that power improvements over the long model are possible. We provide practical guidance for the design of new experiments and the analysis of completed experiments.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01317
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Inaccurate Statistical Discrimination: An Identification Problem,"J. Aislinn Bohren, Kareem Haggag, Alex Imas and Devin G. Pope","We study inaccurate beliefs as a source of discrimination. Economists typically characterize discrimination as stemming from a taste-based (preference) or accurate statistical (belief-based) source. Although individuals may have inaccurate beliefs about how relevant characteristics (e.g., productivity, signals) are correlated with group identity, fewer than 7% of empirical discrimination papers in economics consider the possibility of such inaccurate statistical discrimination. Using theory and a labor market experiment, we show that failing to account for inaccurate beliefs leads to a misclassification of source. We outline three methods to identify source: varying observed signals, belief elicitation, and an intervention to target inaccurate beliefs.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01367
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,"Flight from Urban Blight: Lead Poisoning, Crime, and Suburbanization",Federico Curci and Federico Masera,In this paper we study the effect of violent crime on residential and firms location decisions and their implications for segregation in cities. We do so by proposing a new instrument to exogenously predict violent crime in city centers. We base our instrument on chemical and medical evidence that links local characteristics of the soil to lead poisoning and aggression. We show that the increase in violent crime between 1960 and 1990 due to lead poisoning moved almost 8 million people to the suburbs. Firms followed by leaving the city centers. We then show that the suburbanization process was characterized by “white flight.”,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01323
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Behavioral Food Subsidies,"Andy Brownback, Alex Imas and Michael A. Kuhn","We conduct a field experiment with low-income shoppers to study how behavioral interventions can improve the effectiveness of healthy food subsidies. Our unique design enables us to deliver subsidies both before and during grocery shopping. We examine the effects of two nonrestrictive changes to the choice environment: giving shoppers agency over the subsidy they receive and introducing a waiting period before a subsidized shopping trip to prompt deliberation about upcoming purchases. These interventions increase healthy food spending by 61% more than a healthy food subsidy alone, resulting in 199% greater healthy spending than in our unsubsidized control group.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01287

The results indicate that higher maximum benefit levels mitigate the effects of layoffs. In particular, they mitigate increases in divorce associated with men’s layoffs; increases in separations associated with women’s layoffs; reductions in fertility associated with men’s layoffs; and increases in fertility associated with women’s layoffs.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01304
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,What Matters for Electrification? Evidence from 70 Years of U.S. Home Heating Choices,Lucas W. Davis,"The percentage of U.S. homes heated with electricity has increased steadily from 1% in 1950 to 40% in 2020. Energy prices, geography, climate, housing characteristics, and income are shown to explain 90% of the increase, with energy prices by far the most important factor. The paper then estimates the cost of an electrification mandate for new homes. Households in warm states tend to prefer electricity anyway, so would be made worse off by less than $350 annually on average. Households in cold states, however, tend to prefer natural gas so would be made worse off by more than $1,000 annually.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01292

Donations increase by 11% when a politician is assigned to a committee dealing with policy issues relevant to a corporate leader’s company. The effect is driven by donations to MCs with the greatest power in the committees. I estimate that, absent an influence motive, donations from corporate leaders during this period would have been lower by $20 million.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01321

I examine this question in the context of climate change-related risk. Using variation in California wildfire activity, I show neighborhoods experiencing large fires increase support by 0.8 percentage points for ballot initiatives which expand the size of government and by 2.4 percentage points for ballot initiatives endorsed by pro-environment interest groups. The effect is stronger in Republican areas and is not driven by shifts in voter registration or turnout, suggesting the mechanism acts through changes in individual preferences rather than compositional changes in the electorate.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01286

We randomly varied subjects of each training group across farmer-exporter clusters—farmers, exporters, both, or none—and provided training on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). We find that training farmers enhances technology adoption and quality upgrading. Yet, the effects are much stronger when farmers and exporters are trained together. We document a plausible mechanism to explain this finding: joint training improves buyer-supplier relationship, which facilitates contract trade between farmers and exporters.

Streeter and Jonathan Wivagg","We analyze data from a survey we administered during the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate the relationship between people’s subjective beliefs about risks and their private protective behaviors. On average, people substantially overestimate the absolute level of risk associated with economic activity, but have directionally correct signals about their relative risk based on their demographic characteristics. Subjective risk beliefs are predictive of changes in economic activities independent of government policies. Government mandates restricting economic behavior, in turn, attenuate the relationship between subjective risk beliefs and protective behaviors.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01309
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Testing for Salience Effects in Choices Under Risk,"Carsten S. Nielsen, Alexander C. Sebald and Peter Sørensen","We construct and run an experiment to test the most basic choice effect predicted by salience theory. Subjects allocate wealth between a risky and a safe investment. While we vary an apparent payoff ratio to influence salience, treatments have economically equivalent consequences. Most other theories of behavior then predict zero effect. Our experimental findings are strongly consistent with the behavioral implication of a continuous version of salience theory. We provide a novel structural estimate on the strength of salience. In our setting, increasing the relative payoff contrast by 1% is equivalent to an increased odds ratio by about 0.4%.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01307
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Bidding on Price and Quality: An Experiment on the Complexity of Scoring Rule Auctions,"Riccardo Camboni, Luca Corazzini, Stefano Galavotti and Paola Valbonesi","We experimentally study procurement auctions when both quality and price matter. We compare two treatments where sellers compete on one dimension only (price or quality), with three treatments where sellers submit a price-quality bid and the winner is determined by a scoring rule that combines the two offers. We find that, in the scoring rule treatments, efficiency and buyer’s utility are lower than predicted. Estimates from a Quantal Response Equilibrium model suggest that increasing the dimension of the strategy space imposes a complexity burden on sellers, so that a simpler mechanism like a quality-only auction may be preferable.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01288
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Too Lucky to Be True: Fairness Views under the Shadow of Cheating,"Stefania Bortolotti, Ivan Soraperra, Matthias Sutter and Claudia Zoller","Income inequalities within societies are often associated with evidence that the rich are more likely to behave unethically and evade more taxes. We study how fairness views and preferences for redistribution are affected when cheating may, but need not, be the cause of income inequalities. In our experiment, we let third parties redistribute income between a rich and a poor stakeholder. In one treatment, income inequality was due only to luck, whereas in two others rich stakeholders might have cheated. The mere suspicion of cheating changes third parties’ fairness views considerably and leads to a strong polarization that is even more pronounced when cheating generates negative externalities.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01394
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,A More Robust t-Test,Ulrich K.

The new test is found to control size much more successfully in small samples compared to existing methods. This holds for the canonical inference for the mean problem based on an i.i.d. sample, but also when comparing two population means and when conducting inference about linear regression coefficients with clustered standard errors.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01291

In this paper, we propose a new approach to bound the effects of such early-pandemic policies on COVID-19 cases and other outcomes while dealing with complications arising from (i) limited availability of COVID-19 tests, (ii) differential availability of COVID-19 tests across locations, and (iii) eligibility requirements for individuals to be tested.

Our confidence intervals are trivial to compute and can provide significant length reductions relative to standard ones when the nuisance parameters are small. At the same time, they entail minimal length increases at any parameter values. We apply our confidence intervals to the linear regression model, prove their uniform validity, and illustrate their length properties in an empirical application to a factorial design field experiment and a Monte Carlo study calibrated to the empirical application.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01297
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Is Mobile Money Changing Rural Africa? Evidence from a Field Experiment,Catia Batista and Pedro C. Vicente,"Rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa are typically underserved by financial services. Mobile money brings a substantial reduction in the transaction costs of remittances. We follow the introduction of mobile money for the first time in rural villages of Mozambique using a randomized field experiment. We find that mobile money increased migration out of these villages, where we observe lower agricultural activity and investment. At the same time, remittances received and welfare of rural households increased, particularly when facing georeferenced village-level floods and household-level idiosyncratic shocks. Our work suggests that mobile money can accelerate urbanization and structural change in sub-Saharan Africa.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01333
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,"Low-Quality Seeds, Labor Supply, and Economic Returns: Experimental Evidence from Tanzania","Erwin Bulte, Savatore Di Falco, Menale Kassie and Xavier Vollenweider","Low productivity in agriculture is a major cause of poverty and food insecurity in Africa. One explanation for low productivity is the widespread presence of low-quality inputs on local markets (“lemon technologies”), which causes uncertainty among farmers and erodes incentives for adoption. We report the results from a field experiment in Tanzania to study the impact of improved maize seeds in a context where we exogenously vary seed quality and uncertainty about seed type. The analysis is at the level of experimental plots owned and managed by farmers (not the entire farm). While improved seed positively affects harvests and reduces the probability of crop failure among fully informed farmers, these benefits are attenuated significantly when farmers are uncertain about the seed type they receive. The main channel linking uncertainty to lower harvest levels is the reallocation of labor—a complementary input. The presence of lemon inputs on the market for modern inputs impedes learning about the profitability of these inputs and increases the yield gap by slowing adoption in subsequent periods.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01285

We estimate the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)—policies that restrict interactions in an attempt to slow the spread of disease—on local invention. We construct a panel of issued patents and NPIs adopted by 50 large U.S. cities during the 1918 flu pandemic. Difference-in-differences estimates show that cities adopting longer NPIs did not experience a decline in patenting during the pandemic relative to short-NPI cities, and they recorded higher patenting afterward. Rather than reduce local invention by restricting localized knowledge spillovers, NPIs adopted during the pandemic may have preserved other inventive factors.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01289
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Revisiting the Origins of Business Cycles With the Size-Variance Relationship,Chen Yeh,"This paper quantifies the importance of the granular channel for the U.S. economy by taking into account that large firms are less volatile than small firms, a feature also known as the size-variance relationship. Intuitively, the largest firms, whose shocks drive granularity, are the least volatile; thus, their influence on aggregates is mitigated. By imposing estimates from the universe of employers for the size-variance relationship in a simple, quantitative framework, I find that the granular hypothesis can rationalize 15% of U.S. aggregate fluctuations, establishing a lower bound for the role of granularity in the U.S. economy.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01374
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Doing More with Less: Predicting Primary Care Provider Effectiveness,Janet Currie and Jonathan Zhang,"We use data from the Veterans Administration to examine the efficacy of primary care providers (PCPs). Leveraging quasi-random assignment of veterans to PCPs, we measure effectiveness using ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) and hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits for mental health or circulatory conditions. PCPs’ variation along these dimensions predicts future outcomes. For example, a 1 standard deviation improvement in mental health effectiveness reduces patient risk of death by 3.8% and lowers costs by 4.4% over the next three years. More effective PCPs do more with less: their patients have fewer primary care visits, specialist referrals, lab panels, or imaging tests.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01290
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Breaking the Links: Natural Resource Booms and Intergenerational Mobility,"Aline Bütikofer, Antonio Dalla-Zuanna and Kjell G Salvanes","This paper demonstrates that a large economic shock such as an oil boom increases intergenerational earnings mobility among directly affected men, mostly through increased bottom-up mobility, but not for women. Preexisting local differences in mobility or shifts in the earnings distributions do not drive these findings. Instead, changes in relative earnings paid to workers with different skills offer the best explanation. Moreover, we document that intergenerational mobility is significantly higher for the indirectly affected third generation and that the oil boom broke the earnings link between first- and third-generation men.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01256
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Bringing Them In or Pushing Them Out? The Labor Market Effects of Pro-Cyclical Unemployment Assistance Changes,Gerard Domènech-Arumí and Silvia Vannutelli,"We exploit an unanticipated labor market reform to estimate the effects of procyclical changes in long-term unemployment assistance (UA). In July 2012, Spain raised the minimum age to receive unlimited-duration UA from 52 to 55. Using a difference-in-differences design, we document that shorter benefits caused (1) shorter unemployment duration, especially among younger workers; (2) higher labor force exit and other programs’ take-up, especially among older workers; and (c) lower wages upon reemployment. The reform induced moderate government savings. Our results highlight the importance of considering the interplay with labor market conditions when designing long-term benefit schedules that affect workers close to retirement.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01310
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Job Market Signaling Through Occupational Licensing,Peter Q. Blair and Bobby W.

We test whether this gap is due to asymmetric information using newly collected data on occupational licensing laws that ban workers with criminal records. We find evidence supporting this hypothesis. The licensing premiums for Black men are largest in licensed occupations that restrict felons, particularly in states with banthe-box laws and at small businesses. In these contexts where a worker’s criminal history is difficult to infer, we find that occupational licensing reduces asymmetric information and reduces the racial wage gap.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01265

Administrative data show name-changing colleges enroll higher-aptitude students, with larger effects for alluring-but-misleading name changes and among students with less information. A large resume audit study suggests a small premium for new college names in most jobs, and a significant penalty in lower-status jobs.

We exploit this historical reversal to estimate the effects of return migration on economic development in Mexico. We find that return migration leads to higher levels of development through improved income, labor, health, and educational outcomes. Our findings suggest that the benefits of migration extend beyond individuals’ tenure abroad, as accumulated capital, skills, and social norms have the potential to contribute to development back home.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01273

Exploring monthly data on judicial output and cross-court movement, we estimate that judges account for at least 23% of the observed variation in the number of cases disposed. With novel data on admission examinations, we show that judges with higher grades perform better than lower-ranked peers.

However, misclassified imagery can lead to misleading conclusions about transition processes. We propose a correction for transition rate estimates based on the econometric measurement error literature to extract the signal (truth) from its noisy measurement (satellite-based classifications). No ground-truth data are required in the implementation. Our proposed correction produces consistent estimates of transition rates, confirmed by longitudinal validation data, while transition rates without correction are severely biased.

In settings where actions are continuous and substitutable in contributing to an endogenous state, I show how beliefs about exogenous state transitions can be separately identified from static payoffs. Applying this method to identifying beliefs about future SO2 allowance prices in the U.S. Acid Rain Program, I find that electric utilities underestimate the movements in the allowance price, leading to compliance strategies that respond too slowly to changing market conditions. Biased beliefs increase an average utility’s compliance cost by equivalently 11.2% of its profits.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01270

Far-apart location pairs were more affected, and the local average causal response is approximately 34.92% to 82.29%.

We estimate longitudinal models that relate privately funded R&D to lagged government-funded R&D using industry-country level data from OECD countries and firm level data from France. To deal with the potentially endogenous allocation of government R&D funds, we use changes in predicted defense R&D as an instrumental variable. In many OECD countries, expenditures for defense-related R&D represent by far the most important form of public subsidies for innovation. In both datasets, we uncover evidence of “crowding in” rather than “crowding out,” as increases in government-funded R&D for an industry or a firm result in significant increases in private sector R&D in that industry or firm. On average, a 10% increase in government-financed R&D generates a 5% to 6% additional increase in privately funded R&D. We also find evidence of international spillovers, as increases in government-funded R&D in a particular industry and country raise private R&D in the same industry in other countries.

We find that total factor productivity (TFP) fell by up to 6% during 2020–2021. The overall impact combined large reductions in ‘within-firm’ productivity, with offsetting positive ‘between-firm’ effects as less productive sectors, and less productive firms within them, contracted. Despite these large pandemic effects, firms’ post-Covid forecasts imply surprisingly little lasting impact on aggregate TFP. We also see significant heterogeneity over firms and sectors, with the greatest impacts in those requiring extensive in-person activity.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01298
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Racial Segregation in Housing Markets and the Erosion of Black Wealth,"Prottoy Akbar, Sijie Li Hickly, Allison Shertzer and Randall P. Walsh","This paper studies how the expansion of segregated neighborhoods eroded black wealth in prewar American cities. Using a novel sample of matched addresses, we find that over a single decade rental prices soared by roughly 50% on city blocks that transitioned from all white to majority black. Meanwhile, pioneering black families paid a 28% premium to buy a home on a majority white block, after which their homes lost 10% of their value. These findings strongly suggest that segregated housing markets cost black families much of the gains associated with moving north during the Great Migration.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01276
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,The Gender Wage Gap in an Online Labor Market: The Cost of Interruptions,"Abi Adams, Kotaro Hara, Kristy Milland and Chris Callison-Burch","This paper analyzes gender differences in working patterns and wages on Amazon Mechanical Turk, a popular online labor platform. Using information on 2 million tasks, we find no gender differences in task selection nor experience. Nonetheless, women earn 20% less per hour on average. Gender differences in working patterns are a significant driver of this wage gap. Women are more likely to interrupt their working time on the platform with consequences for their task completion speed. A follow-up survey shows that the gender differences in working patterns and hourly wages are concentrated among workers with children.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01282
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Why Don’t We Sleep Enough? A Field Experiment among College Students,"Mallory Avery, Osea Giuntella and Peiran Jiao","This study investigates the mechanisms affecting sleep choice and explores whether commitment devices and monetary incentives can be used to promote healthier sleep habits. To this end, we conducted a field experiment with college students, providing them incentives to sleep and collecting data from wearable activity trackers, surveys, and time-use diaries. Monetary incentives were effective in increasing sleep duration with some evidence of persistence after the incentive was removed. We uncover evidence of demand for commitment. Our results are consistent with partially sophisticated time-inconsistent preferences and overconfidence and have implications for the effectiveness of information interventions on sleep choice.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01242
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Who Opts In? Composition Effects and Disappointment from Participation Payments,"Sandro Ambuehl, Axel Ockenfels and Colin Stewart","Participation payments are used in many transactions about which people know little but can learn more: incentives for medical trial participation, signing bonuses for job applicants, or price rebates on consumer durables. Who opts into the transaction when given such incentives? We theoretically and experimentally identify a composition effect whereby incentives disproportionately increase participation among those for whom learning is harder. Moreover, these individuals use less information to decide whether to participate, which makes disappointment more likely. The learning-based composition effect is stronger in settings in which information acquisition is more difficult.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01268
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Competition and Productivity: Evidence from Peruvian Municipalities,"Marc Schiffbauer, James Sampi and Javier Coronado","This paper uses new data on the removal of local, sector-specific barriers to firm entry across 1,800 municipalities in Peru to estimate the impact on firm productivity and markups. New legislation in 2013 strengthened the national competition authority's mandate to enforce the elimination of local entry barriers, providing a quasi-experimental setting to identify the impact of competition on productivity within the controlled institutional environment of a single country. We find that the elimination of local entry barriers boosted productivity, pointing to the critical role of subnational market entry barriers in explaining countries’ laggard productivity performances despite liberalized national regulatory environments.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01257
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,On the Economic Consequences of Mass Shootings,Abel Brodeur and Hasin Yousaf,"In this paper, we investigate the economic consequences of mass shootings. We find that shootings have negative effects on targeted counties’ economies. Estimates using three different comparison groups yield similar results. Examining the mechanisms, we find that residents of targeted areas: (i) develop pessimistic views of financial and local business conditions; and (ii) are more likely to report poor mental health, which hinders usual activities such as work, suggesting that shootings lead to decreases in productivity. Further, we find that greater national media coverage of shootings exacerbates their local economic consequences.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01241
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,What Happens to Workers at Firms that Automate?,"James Bessen, Maarten Goos, Anna Salomons and Wiljan van den Berge","We estimate the impact of firm-level automation on individual worker outcomes by combining Dutch microdata with a direct measure of automation expenditures covering all private nonfinancial sector firms. Using a novel difference-in-differences event-study design leveraging lumpy investment, we find that automation increases the probability of incumbent workers separating from their employers. Workers experience a five-year cumulative wage income loss of 9% of one year’s earnings, driven by decreases in days worked. These adverse impacts of automation are larger in smaller firms, and for older and middle-educated workers. By contrast, no such losses are found for firms’ investments in computers.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01284
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,What Do Cross-Country Surveys Tell Us about Social Capital?,"David Tannenbaum, Alain Cohn, Christian Lukas Zünd and Michel Maréchal","We assess the predictive power of survey measures of social capital with a new behavioral data set that examines whether citizens report a lost wallet to its owner. Using data from more than 17,000 lost wallets across 40 countries, we find that survey measures of social capital—especially questions concerning generalized trust or generalized morality—are strongly and significantly correlated with country-level differences in wallet reporting rates. A second finding is that lost wallet reporting rates predict unique variation in the outputs of social capital, such as economic development and government effectiveness, not captured by existing measures.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01245
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Deleting a Signal: Evidence from Pre-employment Credit Checks,Alexander Bartik and Scott T. Nelson,"We study the removal of information from a market, such as a job-applicant screening tool. We characterize how removal harms groups with relative advantage in that information: typically those for whom the banned information is most precise relative to alternative signals. We illustrate this using recent bans on employers’ use of credit report data. Bans decrease job-finding rates for Black job-seekers by 3 percentage points and increase involuntary separations for Black new hires by 4 percentage points, primarily because other screening tools, such as interviews, have around 60% higher standard deviation of signal noise for Black relative to white job-seekers.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01406
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,"Do Export Support Programs Affect Prices, Quality, Markups, and Marginal Costs? Evidence From a Natural Policy Experiment","Magnus T. Buus, Jakob Munch, Joel Rodrigue and Georg Schaur","Firms’ success in international markets depends on their product’s quality, prices, markups, and marginal cost. However, causally identified empirical evidence for the effect of trade policies that address nontariff barriers on these mechanisms is rare. To fill this gap, we exploit a quasinatural experiment in Denmark and examine the effects of an export support policy aimed at reducing nontariff barriers to trade. We find that export support raises firm-level exports within markets. However, export support does not affect prices, quality, markups, or marginal costs. Instead, the results support trade theory predicting that firms grow in export markets by shifting demand.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01274
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Ask a Local: Improving the Public Pricing of Land Titles in Urban Tanzania,Martina Manara and Tanner Regan,"Information on willingness-to-pay is key for public pricing and allocation of services but not easily collected. Studying land titles in Dar-es-Salaam, we ask whether local leaders know and will reveal plot owners’ willingness-to-pay. We randomly assign leaders to predict under different settings then elicit owners’ actual willingness-to-pay. Demand is substantial but below exorbitant fees. Leaders can predict the aggregate demand curve and distinguish variation across owners. Predictions worsen when used to target subsidies, but adding cash incentives mitigates this. We demonstrate that leader-elicited information can improve the public pricing of title deeds, raising uptake while maintaining public funds.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01247
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Getting the Price Right? The Impact of Competitive Bidding in the Medicare Program,"Hui Ding, Mark Duggan and Amanda Starc","We study Medicare’s competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment. We use Medicare claims data to examine the effect on prices and utilization, focusing on continuous positive airway pressure devices for sleep apnea. We find that spending falls by 47.2% after a highly imperfect bidding mechanism is introduced. This is almost entirely driven by a 44.8% price reduction, though quantities also fall by 4.3%. To disentangle supply and demand, we leverage differential cost sharing across Medicare recipients. We measure a demand elasticity of −0.272 and find that quantity reductions are concentrated among less clinically appropriate groups.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01249
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Latent Exports: Almost Ideal Gravity and Zeros,James Anderson and Penglong Zhang,Export promotion at the extensive margin is a key concern of governments. We develop measures of how far firms in origin sectors are from break-even entry in destination markets. The measure is based on Almost Ideal gravity featuring heterogeneous price and income elasticities. Tobit estimation of 2006 trade flows for 75 countries and 25 sectors generates latent trade bias (LTB)—the latent (projected) trade share of nonpartners minus the as-if-frictionless trade share. Explained LTB variance decomposition shows that variable trade costs (distance and tariffs together) account for zero flows more than do fixed trade costs (entry cost) and income variation.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01251
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Peer Advice on Financial Decisions: A Case of the Blind Leading the Blind?,"Sandro Ambuehl, B. Douglas Bernheim, Fulya Ersoy and Donna Harris","We investigate the impact of peer interaction on the quality of financial decision making in a laboratory experiment. Face-to-face communication with a randomly assigned peer significantly improves the quality of subsequent private decisions even though simple mimicry would have the opposite effect. We present evidence that the mechanism involves general conceptual learning (because the benefits of communication extend to previously unseen tasks), and that the most effective learning relationships are horizontal rather than vertical (because people with weak skills benefit most when their partners also have weak skills). The benefits of demonstrably effective financial education do not propagate to peers.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01269
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Communicating through Defaults,"Steffen Altmann, Armin Falk and Andreas Grunewald","We report the results of two laboratory experiments and a representative survey that investigate how default effects are shaped by information asymmetries and strategic incentives. We document that defaults are more informative when the interests of default setters and decision makers are more closely aligned. Decision makers’ propensity to accept defaults depends, both, on the alignment of interests and the quality of their information. In a second experiment, we demonstrate that decision makers are more likely to follow defaults than to accept (equally informative) advice. Complementary evidence from a representative survey underlines that consumers commonly perceive defaults as being set strategically.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01260
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2025,Borrowing in an Illegal Market: Contracting with Loan Sharks,"Kevin Lang, Kaiwen Leong, Huailu Li and Haibo Xu","Using over 11,000 unlicensed loans to over 1,000 borrowers in Singapore, we provide basic information about an understudied market: illegal moneylending. Borrowers and lenders interact frequently and rely primarily on relational contracts to enforce their agreements. Borrowers have high discount rates, often have gambling and/or substance abuse problems, and often repay late. While lenders sometimes resort to nonfinancial punishments, the primary cost of late repayment is the compounding of a very high interest rate. Consistent with our view that lenders cannot extract all surplus, a crackdown on illegal lending raised interest rates and lowered the size of loans.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01246

Pavia, Kristina Stratford, Matthew Samore and Steven Alder","We provide a method to track the active prevalence of COVID-19 in real time, correcting for time-varying sample selection in symptom-based testing data and incomplete tracking of recovered cases and fatalities. Our method only requires publicly available data on positive testing rates in combination with one parameter, which we estimate based on a representative randomized sample of nearly 10,000 individuals tested in Utah in May and June 2020. We validate our method using external studies in Indiana in April 2020 and two counties in Utah in March 2021. In all three locations and times, our estimates of latent prevalence are within the 95 percent confidence intervals of prevalence estimates from randomized testing. Applying our method to all 50 states, we show that true prevalence is 2–3 times higher than publicly reported.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01302
