The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Fear and the Safety Net: Evidence from Secure Communities,Marcella Alsan and Crystal S. Yang,"We study the effects of Secure Communities, an immigration enforcement program that dramatically increased interior removals of Hispanic noncitizens from the United States, on participation in means-tested social insurance programs among co-ethnic citizens. Exploiting county-level variation in the roll-out of enforcement together with its ethnic specificity, we find that Hispanic-headed citizen households significantly reduced their participation in two large federal safety net programs. Our results are most consistent with network effects that propagate fear through minority communities rather than stigma or lack of benefit information.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01250
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Local Economic Impacts of Prisons,Janjala Chirakijja,"I examine the economic consequences of prisons on local communities using two complementary approaches. The first uses prison openings during the 1990s across the United States, and the second exploits the results of the prison site-selection competitions in Texas. Prisons bring substantial and persistent gains in public employment. However, additional jobs at the prisons generate little spillover effects on private sector employment and fail to provide a major boost to local economic activity—overall resulting in approximately a one-for-one increase in local employment. Neighborhoods closest to prisons also experience declines in housing values and demographic shifts toward low-socioeconomic status households.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01267
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Political Economy of Immigration Enforcement: Conflict and Cooperation under Federalism,Alberto Ciancio and Camilo García-Jimeno,"Selection forces often confound the effects of policy changes. In the immigration enforcement context, we tackle this challenge tracking arrested immigrants along the deportation pipeline, isolating local and federal efforts. 80% of counties exhibit strategic substitutabilities in responding to federal enforcement, while the federal level is very effective at directing its efforts toward cooperative counties. We estimate that changes in the profile of immigration cases, and not weakened federal efforts, drove the reduction in deportations following a 2011 shift in federal priorities. Reducing immigration-court discretion and removing their dependence from the executive would have a significant impact on deportations.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01266
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,"Worker Earnings, Service Quality, and Firm Profitability: Evidence from Nursing Homes and Minimum Wage Reforms",Krista Ruffini,"This paper examines whether higher earnings for frontline workers affects the quality of employees’ output. I leverage increases in the statutory minimum wage, combined with worker, consumer, and firm outcomes in the nursing home sector. I find that higher minimum wages increase income and retention among low-wage employees and improve consumer outcomes, measured by fewer inspection violations; lower rates of adverse, preventable health conditions; and lower resident mortality. Firms maintain profitability by attracting consumers with a greater ability to pay and increasing prices for these individuals.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01271
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Causal Effects of R&D Grants: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity,"Pietro Santoleri, Andrea Mina, Alberto Di Minin and Irene Martelli","We leverage the discontinuity in the assignment mechanism of the Small and Medium Enterprise Instrument—the first European research and development (R&D) subsidy targeting small firms—to provide the broadest quasi-experimental evidence on R&D grants over both geographical and sectoral scopes. Grants trigger sizable impacts on a wide range of firm-level outcomes. Heterogeneous effects are consistent with grants reducing financial frictions. This reduction is due to funding rather than certification. We also provide direct causal evidence on pure certification—signaling not attached to funding—and show that firms that only receive “quality stamps” do not improve their performance. Finally, our estimates suggest that the scheme produces private returns that are positive and comparable to those of the U.S. Small Business Innovation Research program, while also generating geographical and sectoral spillovers in the form of increased rates of entrepreneurial entry.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01233
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,"Market Access, Trade Costs, and Technology Adoption: Evidence from Northern Tanzania","Shilpa Aggarwal, Brian Giera, Dahyeon Jeong, Jonathan Robinson and Alan Spearot","We collect data on prices, travel costs, and farmer decisions to quantify market access for chemical fertilizer and its impact on agricultural productivity in 1,180 villages in Northern Tanzania. Villages at the bottom of the travel cost-adjusted input price distribution face 40%–55% less favorable prices than those at the top. A standard deviation increase in village-level remoteness is associated with 20%–25% lower input adoption. A spatial model of input adoption conservatively estimates that total trade costs are 4 times pecuniary travel costs. Counterfactuals suggest that halving travel costs would more than double adoption and reduce the adoption-remoteness gradient by 63%.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01263
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Licensing Life-Saving Drugs for Developing Countries: Evidence from the Medicines Patent Pool,Alberto Galasso and Mark Schankerman,"We study the effects of the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP)—an institution that pools patents across geographical markets—on the licensing and adoption of life-saving drugs in low- and middle-income countries. We show the presence of an immediate and large increase in licensing when a patent is included in the MPP. We also show evidence that the pool increases actual entry and volume of sales, but these impacts are much smaller than on licensing, which is due to the geographic bundling of licenses. The paper highlights the potential of pools in promoting diffusion of biomedical innovation in developing countries.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01253
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Measuring Preferences for Income Equality and Income Mobility,Bernardo Lara E. and Kenneth A. Shores,"This paper quantifies preferences for income equality and mobility by generating statistics that are uncorrelated with beliefs and can be interpreted as marginal rates of substitution (MRS). All things being equal, U.S. residents are willing to reduce average income by $2,744 to reduce the 90/10 income inequality ratio one unit, and $1,228 to increase income mobility from the bottom quintile one percentage point. Democrats and Independents have similar preferences for both social variables, while Republicans have an MRS that is about two-thirds that of Democrats and Independents for both income inequality and mobility.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01240
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Air Pollution and the Labor Market: Evidence from Wildfire Smoke,"Mark Borgschulte, David Molitor and Eric Zou","We study how air pollution impacts the U.S. labor market by analyzing the effects of drifting wildfire smoke. We link satellite-based smoke plume data with labor market outcomes to estimate that an additional day of smoke exposure reduces quarterly earnings by about 0.1%. Extensive margin responses, including employment reductions and labor force exits, explain 13% of the overall earnings losses. The implied welfare costs from lost earnings due to air pollution exposure is on par with standard valuations of the mortality burden. The findings highlight the importance of labor market channels in air pollution policy responses.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01243
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Impacts of the U.S. Trade War on Chinese Exporters,"Yang Jiao, Zhikuo Liu, Zhiwei Tian and Xiaxin Wang","This paper studies the impacts of the 2018 U.S. tariff surges on export prices and adjustments of sales across different markets of Chinese exporters. The finding that U.S. tariffs did not affect the free-on-board price of Chinese exports is robust to controlling for firm-related fixed effects. While firms’ exports to the United States dropped significantly, exports to the EU increased moderately and domestic sales or exports to other foreign markets were barely affected. Finally, by surveying managers of exporting firms, we shed light on potential impediments to firms’ adjustments of export prices and sales.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01229
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Price of Inclusion: Evidence from Housing Developer Behavior,Evan J. Soltas,"In many cities, incentives and regulations lead developers to integrate low-income housing into market-rate buildings. How cost-effective are these policies? I study take-up of a tax incentive in New York City using a model in which developers trade off between tax savings and pretax income. Estimating the model using policy variation and microdata on development from 2003 to 2015, I find a citywide marginal fiscal cost of $1.6 million per low-income unit. Differences in neighborhoods, not developer incidence, explain the cost premium over other housing programs. Weighing costs against estimates of neighborhood effects, I conclude middle-class neighborhoods offer “opportunity bargains.”",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01231
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,A Cold Shower for the Hot Hand Fallacy: Robust Evidence from Controlled Settings,Joshua B. Miller and Adam Sanjurjo,"The canonical hot hand fallacy result was recently reversed, based largely on a single statistic, and a data set that was underpowered for individual-level testing. Here we perform a more robust analysis, testing whether hot hand performance exists across (i) data sets: four different controlled shooting experiments, (ii) time: multiple sessions per individual spread across a six month gap, and (iii) various (improved) approaches to statistical testing. We find strong evidence of hot hand performance, both across data sets and within individuals across time. Moreover, in a study of beliefs, we find that expert observers can successfully predict which shooters get the hottest.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01280
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Measuring Under- and Overreaction in Expectation Formation,Simas Kučinskas and Florian S. Peters,"We develop a framework for measuring under- and overreaction in expectation formation. The basic insight is that under- and overreaction to new information is identified (up to sign) by the impulse response function of forecast errors. Our measurement procedure yields estimates of under- and overreaction to different shocks at various horizons. In an application to inflation expectations, we find that forecasters underreact to aggregate shocks but overreact to idiosyncratic shocks. We illustrate how our approach can be used to (i) quantify the importance of different biases, (ii) estimate theoretical models, and (iii) shed light on existing empirical approaches and puzzles.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01255
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Endogenous Firm Competition and the Cyclicality of Markups,Hassan Afrouzi and Luigi Caloi,"We show that the cyclicality of output growth is a sufficient predictor for the cyclicality of markups in models that micro-found variable markups through dynamic trade-offs. We use data on markups from the U.S. as well as survey data on firms’ expectations from New Zealand to test the predictions of these models and find evidence in favor of their mechanisms. Finally, we study the implications of these mechanisms for cyclicality of markups in a calibrated general equilibrium model. In particular, we find that the degree of hump-shaped response in output is crucial for the direction of aggregate markup cyclicality.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01281
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Endogenous Treatment Effect Estimation with a Large and Mixed Set of Instruments and Control Variables,Qingliang Fan and Yaqian Wu,"Instrumental variables (IVs) and control variables are frequently used to assist researchers in investigating endogenous treatment effects. When used together, their identities are typically assumed to be known. However, in many practical situations, one is faced with a large and mixed set of covariates, some of which can serve as excluded IVs, some can serve as control variables, whereas others should be discarded from the model. It is often not possible to classify them based on economic theory alone. This paper proposes a data-driven method to classify a large (increasing with sample size) set of covariates into excluded IVs, controls, and noise to be discarded. The resulting IV estimator is shown to have the oracle property (to have the same first-order asymptotic distribution as the IV estimator, assuming the true classification is known).",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01230
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Impact of Retail E-Commerce on Relative Prices and Consumer Welfare,"Yoon Jo, Misaki Matsumura and David Weinstein","This paper examines the impact of retail e-commerce on pricing behavior and welfare. Using Japanese data, we find that e-commerce lowered relative inflation rates for goods sold intensively online. We use long time series and historical catalog sales as an instrument for e-commerce sales intensity. The entry of e-commerce firms raised the rate of intercity price convergence in physical stores for goods sold intensively online, but not for other goods, which suggests e-commerce enhances price arbitrage. We estimate that e-commerce lowered variety-adjusted prices on average by 0.9% between 1996 and 2014, and more in cities with highly educated populations.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01272
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,NGOs and the Effectiveness of Interventions,"Faraz Usmani, Marc Jeuland and Subhrendu K. Pattanayak","Programs implemented by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are often more effective than comparable efforts by other actors, yet relatively little is known about how implementer identity drives final outcomes. By combining a stratified field experiment in India with a triple-difference estimation strategy, we show that a local development NGO’s prior engagement with target communities increases the effectiveness of a technology promotion program implemented in these areas by at least 30%. This “NGO reputation effect” has implications for the generalizability and scalability of evidence from experimental research conducted with local implementation partners.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01217
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Regulated Revenues and Hospital Behavior: Evidence from a Medicare Overhaul,"Tal Gross, Adam Sacarny, Maggie Shi and David Silver","We study a 2008 policy reform in which Medicare revised its hospital payment system to better reflect patients’ severity of illness. We construct a simulated instrument that predicts a hospital’s policy-induced change in reimbursement using pre-reform patients and postreform rules. The reform led to large persistent changes in Medicare payment rates across hospitals. Hospitals that faced larger gains in Medicare reimbursement increased the volume of Medicare patients they treated. The estimates imply a volume elasticity of 1.2. To accommodate greater volume, hospitals increased nurse employment, but also lowered length of stay.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01254
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Who Pays Sin Taxes? Understanding the Overlapping Burdens of Corrective Taxes,"Christopher Conlon, Nirupama Rao and Yinan Wang","We find that sin-good purchases are highly concentrated, with 10% of households paying more than 80% of taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. Total sin-tax burdens are poorly explained by demographics (including income) but are well explained by eight household clusters defined by purchasing patterns. The two most taxed clusters comprise 8% of households, pay 63% of sin taxes, and are older, less educated, and lower income. Taxes on sugary beverages broaden the tax base but add to the burdens of heavily taxed households. Efforts to increase sin taxes should consider the heavy burdens borne by few households.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01235
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,"Productivity, Place, and Plants",Benjamin Schoefer and Oren Ziv,"Why do cities differ so much in productivity? A long literature has sought out systematic sources, such as inherent productivity advantages, market access, agglomeration forces, or sorting. We document that up to three-quarters of the measured regional productivity dispersion is spurious, reflecting the “luck of the draw” of finite counts of idiosyncratically heterogeneous plants that happen to operate in a given location. The patterns are even more pronounced for new plants, hold for alternative productivity measures, and broadly extend to European countries. This large role for individual plants suggests a smaller role for places in driving regional differences.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01275
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Publication and Attenuation Biases in Measuring Skill Substitution,"Tomas Havranek, Zuzana Irsova, Lubica Laslopova and Olesia Zeynalova","A key parameter in the analysis of wage inequality is the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor. We show that the empirical literature is consistent with both publication and attenuation bias in the estimated inverse elasticities. Publication bias, which exaggerates the mean reported inverse elasticity, dominates and results in corrected inverse elasticities closer to zero than the typically published estimates. The implied mean elasticity is 4, with a lower bound of 2. Elasticities are smaller for developing countries. To derive these results, we use nonlinear tests for publication bias and model averaging techniques that account for model uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01227
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,"Discrimination, Migration, and Economic Outcomes: Evidence from World War I",Andreas Ferrara and Price Fishback,"This paper examines the individual and aggregate costs of ethnic discrimination. Studying Germans in the United States during World War I, an event that abruptly downgraded their previously high social standing, we show that anti-German sentiment was strongly associated with counties’ casualties in the war, leading to subsequent outmigration of Germans. Such relocation to evade discrimination was costly for German workers. However, counties with larger outflows of Germans, who tended to be well-trained manufacturing workers, incurred economic costs too, including a drop in average annual manufacturing wages of 0.6% to 2.2%. This effect lasted at least until 1930.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01209
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Vagaries of the Sea: Evidence on the Real Effects of Money from Maritime Disasters in the Spanish Empire,"Adam Brzezinski, Yao Chen, Nuno Palma and Felix Ward",We estimate the effect of money supply changes on the real economy by exploiting a recurring natural experiment: maritime disasters in the Spanish Empire (1531–1810) that resulted in the loss of substantial amounts of silver money. We find that negative money supply shocks caused Spanish real output to decline. A transmission channel analysis highlights slow price adjustments and credit frictions as mechanisms through which money supply changes affected the real economy. Especially large output declines occurred in textile manufacturing against the backdrop of a credit crunch that impaired merchants’ ability to supply their manufacturers with inputs.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01223
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Legal Protection against Retaliatory Firing Improves Workplace Safety,"Matthew S. Johnson, Daniel Schwab and Patrick Koval","Workplace safety policies are designed to ensure that employers internalize the costs of injuries, but employers can undermine these policies with threats of dismissal. We show that states’ adoption of the public policy exception to at-will employment—an exception forbidding employers from firing workers for filing workers’ compensation claims or for whistleblowing—led to a substantial reduction in injuries. The widespread adoption of the public policy exception explains 14% of the decline in fatal injury rates between 1979 and 1994. Statutory protections from retaliatory firing also improved safety, but only when employers faced sufficiently strong penalties for violating them.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01225
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,"Impacts of Environmental Degradation: Forest Loss, Malaria, and Child Outcomes in Nigeria",Julia Berazneva and Tanya S. Byker,"We examine the effect of forest loss around the time of birth on infant mortality and the early childhood health of children in rural Nigeria. We find that forest loss leads to an increase in neonatal mortality—one standard deviation of forest loss is associated with a 9%–15% increase in the likelihood of death within the first month of life. The mechanism linking forest loss to infant death is maternal exposure to malaria when the child is in utero. Such exposure also results in worse birth outcomes, proxied by lower weight-for-age and height-for-age of surviving infants.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01238
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Freeway Revolts! The Quality of Life Effects of Highways,Jeffrey Brinkman and Jeffrey Lin,"Why do freeways affect spatial structure? We identify and quantify the local disamenity effects of freeways. Freeways cause slower growth in central neighborhoods (where local disamenities exceed regional accessibility benefits) compared with outlying neighborhoods (where access benefits exceed disamenities). A quantitative model calibrated to Chicago attributes one-third of the effect of freeways on central-city decline to reduced quality of life. Barrier effects are a major factor in the disamenity value of a freeway. Local disamenities from freeways, as opposed to their regional accessibility benefits, had large effects on the spatial structure of cities, suburbanization, and welfare.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01244
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,"Import Competition, Quality Upgrading, and Exporting: Evidence from the Peruvian Apparel Industry",Pamela Medina,"This paper studies quality upgrading to escape competition from low-wage countries and proposes a new channel that does not rely on access to new inputs or markets. Informed by Peruvian apparel firms’ response to China’s WTO accession, I introduce factor specificity in a multi-product-firm model. Profitability losses due to competition in low-quality segments induce firms to reallocate specific factors to produce high-quality varieties for high-income countries. Gains from this channel are large. Using an observed quality measure, I show that import competition substantially increases domestic firms’ exports and high-quality export shares. Firms also reduce prices, resulting in additional welfare gains.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01221
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Value of Private Schools: Evidence from Pakistan,"Pedro Carneiro, Jishnu Das and Hugo Reis","Using unique data from Pakistan, we estimate a model of demand for differentiated products in 112 rural education markets with significant choice among public and private schools. Families are willing to pay substantially for reductions in distance to school, but, in contrast, price elasticities are low. Using the demand estimates, we show that the existence of a low-fee private school market is of great value for households in our sample, reaching 2% to 7% of annual per capita expenditure for those choosing private schools.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01237
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Intertemporal Consumption with Risk: A Revealed Preference Analysis,"Joshua Lanier, Bin Miao, John Quah and Songfa Zhong","We run an experiment to elicit preferences over state-contingent timed payouts. We analyze the data using a new revealed preference method (building on Nishimura et al., 2017) that can test for consistency with utility functions that increase with a given preorder. We find that correlation neutrality, a property implied by discounted expected utility, is widely violated and there is, instead, strong evidence of intertemporal correlation averse behavior. Our results suggest that utility is not additive across both states and time and that credible models of choice need to allow people to prefer negative correlation in timed payouts.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01220
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Forecaster (Mis-)Behavior,Tobias Broer and Alexandre N. Kohlhas,"We document two stylized facts in expectational survey data. First, professional forecasters overrevise their macroeconomic expectations. Second, such overrevisions mask evidence of both over- and underreactions to public signals. We show that the first fact is inconsistent with standard models of noisy rational expectations, but consistent with behavioral and strategic models. The second fact, in contrast, presents a puzzle for existing theories. We propose an extension of noisy rational expectations that allows forecasters to be overconfident in their information. We show that this feature when combined with the endogeneity of public signals leads to over- and undereactions consistent with the data.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01210
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Skeptical Employers: Experimental Evidence on Biased Beliefs Constraining Firm Growth,Stefano A. Caria and Paolo Falco,"Does low trust in workers discourage firms from hiring? We conduct an experiment in Ghana with real entrepreneurs who have the option to hire anonymous workers for a trivial but tedious task. Shirking attracts no penalty and completion of the task is an indicator of trustworthiness. We elicit employers’ expectations and study how they change with random signals of workers’ previous behavior. We find that employers underestimate workers’ trustworthiness, which reduces hiring and profits. Negative signals lower employers’ expectations, while positive signals do not affect them. This asymmetry can help to sustain an equilibrium with limited experimentation and biased beliefs.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01219
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Identifying Rule-Based Rationality,Yoram Halevy and Guy Mayraz,The revealed preference methodology allows an observer to infer preferences from choices. This paper extends this fundamental idea by experimentally identifying the preference for basing choices on simple decision rules. Subjects not only make case-by-case portfolio allocations but also design a simple investment rule for selecting portfolios. They then choose between these two decision modes for an additional set of problems. The majority opt for the rule interface and in most cases choose a simple investment rule that cannot be rationalized by any simple utility function or accounted for by reductions in decision time or by cognitive costs.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01232
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Behavioral Biases among Producers: Experimental Evidence of Anchoring in Procurement Auctions,"Paul Ferraro, Kent D.

In three field experiments involving commercial agricultural producers in the United States, we detect evidence of anchoring in competitive auctions for conservation contracts related to nutrient and pest management that were worth, on average, nearly $9,000. In these auctions, the value of the starting cost-share bid was randomized to be either 0% or 100%. When the starting value was 100%, final bids were 46% higher, on average. We find weak evidence that experience with conservation contracts may modestly attenuate the anchoring effect.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01215
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Value of Health Insurance during a Crisis: Effects of Medicaid Implementation on Pandemic Influenza Mortality,"Karen Clay, Joshua Lewis, Edson Severnini and Xiao Wang","This paper studies how better access to public health insurance affects infant mortality during pandemics. The analysis combines cross-state variation in mandated eligibility for Medicaid with two influenza pandemics that arrived shortly before and after the program’s introduction in 1965. We find that better access to public health insurance in high-eligibility states substantially reduced pandemic infant mortality. The reductions in pandemic infant mortality are too large to be attributable solely to new Medicaid recipients, suggesting that expanded access to public health insurance helped mitigate disease transmission among the broader population.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01239
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Addressing COVID-19 Outliers in BVARs with Stochastic Volatility,"Andrea Carriero, Todd Clark, Massimiliano Marcellino and Elmar Mertens","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to enormous data movements that strongly affect parameters and forecasts from standard Bayesian vector autoregressions (BVARs). To address these issues, we propose BVAR models with outlier-augmented stochastic volatility (SV) that combine transitory and persistent changes in volatility. The resulting density forecasts are much less sensitive to outliers in the data than standard BVARs. Predictive Bayes factors indicate that our outlier-augmented SV model provides the best fit for the pandemic period, as well as for earlier subsamples of high volatility. In historical forecasting, outlier-augmented SV schemes fare at least as well as a conventional SV model.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01213
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,"Trade, Gravity, and Aggregation","Holger Breinlich, Dennis Novy and João Santos Silva","Gravity equations are an important tool in empirical international trade research. We study to what extent sector-level parameters can be recovered from aggregate gravity equations estimated via Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood. We show that in the leading case where trade cost regressors do not vary at the sector level, estimates obtained with aggregate data have a clear interpretation as a weighted average of sectoral elasticities. Otherwise the estimates are biased, but researchers may possibly infer the direction of the bias. We illustrate our results by revisiting Baier and Bergstrand’s (2007) influential study of the effects of free trade agreements.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01234

The focus is on an intensive vaccine campaign to quell an epidemic in the short run. Across a range of market structures, positive vaccine externalities and optimal subsidies peak for diseases that spread quickly, but not so quickly that everyone is driven to be vaccinated. We assess the practical relevance of this peak—as well as the existence of increasing social returns to vaccination and optimality of universal vaccination—in calibrations to the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01202

I compare uniquely detailed new mortality data covering 1866 to 1965 to the timing of London’s famous fog events, which trapped emissions in the city. I show that air pollution was a major contributor to mortality in London over this period and that it interacted strongly with specific infectious diseases. As a consequence of this interaction, reductions in the infectious disease burden substantially altered the health costs of pollution.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01190
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Hospital Allocation and Racial Disparities in Health Care,"Amitabh Chandra, Pragya Kakani and Adam Sacarny","We develop a framework to measure the role of hospital allocation in racial disparities in health care and use it to study Black and white heart attack patients. Black patients receive care at lower-performing hospitals than white patients. However, over two decades, the performance gap between hospitals treating Black and white patients shrank by over two-thirds. This progress is due to more rapid performance improvement at hospitals that tended to treat Black patients rather than reallocation of patients. Hospital improvement is correlated with adoption of a productivity-raising input, beta blockers. Our work highlights reallocation and performance improvement as future disparity-reduction levers.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01248

We find that this policy causally reduced injury-induced mortality in the country by at least 14%. We argue that this estimate constitutes a lower bound on the true impact of alcohol on injury-induced mortality. We also document a sharp drop in violent crimes, indicating a tight link between alcohol and aggressive behavior in society. Our results underscore the severe harm that alcohol can cause and point toward a role for policy measures that target the heaviest drinkers in society.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01228
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Effect of Incarceration on Mortality,"Samuel Norris, Matthew Pecenco and Jeffrey Weaver","This paper analyzes the effect of incarceration on mortality using administrative data from Ohio between 1992 and 2017. We first document that long-run survival is higher among the incarcerated than similar nonincarcerated defendants. Using event study designs centered around the time of release, we show why: mortality risk halves during the period of incarceration, with large reductions in murders, overdoses, and natural causes of death. However, incarceration does not increase postrelease mortality, and so the overall effect is increased longevity. These estimates reflect the high-risk environment faced by defendants when not incarcerated and suggest noncarceral policies to reduce these risks.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01224
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,"A Year Older, A Year Wiser (and Farther from Frontier): Invention Rents and Human Capital Depreciation","Philippe Aghion, Ufuk Akcigit, Ari Hyytinen and Otto Toivanen","We look at how the arrival of an invention affects wage returns and the probability of moving out of employment for white- and blue-collar co-workers of the inventor. First results suggest that older workers are hurt by the arrival of an invention. This negative effect disappears when we control for education and, in particular, for the time since obtaining the last formal degree, that is, distance to human capital frontier.

The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Children’s Sleep and Human Capital Production,Maulik Jagnani,"This paper uses exogenous variation in sleep induced by sunset time to present the first human capital estimates of (i) the effects of child sleep from the developing world and (ii) the long-run effects of child sleep in any context. Later sunset reduces children’s sleep: when the sun sets later, children go to bed later but fail to compensate by waking up later. Sleep-deprived children study less and increase nap time and indoor leisure activities. Short-run sleep loss decreases children’s test scores. Chronic sleep deficits translate into fewer years of education and lower primary and middle school completion rates among school-age children.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01201
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Fireside Chats: Communication and Consumers’ Expectations in the Great Depression,Mathieu Pedemonte,"This paper shows how policy announcements can be used to manage expectations. Using regional variation in radio exposure, I evaluate the impact of FDR’s 1935 Fireside Chat, in which he showcased the introduction of important social policies, establishing a new expansionary cycle of the New Deal. I document that cities with higher exposure to the announcement exhibited a significant increase in spending on durable goods. The estimated effect is consistent with changes in expectations in line with the policies announced. This paper shows the power of communication as a policy tool.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01200
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,"Monetary Policy, Markup Dispersion, and Aggregate TFP",Matthias Meier and Timo Reinelt,"We study the role of markup dispersion and aggregate TFP for monetary transmission. Empirically, we show that the response of markup dispersion to monetary policy shocks can account for a significant fraction of the aggregate TFP response in the first two years after the shock. Analytically, we show that heterogeneous price rigidity can explain the response of markup dispersion if firms have a precautionary price-setting motive, which is present in common New Keynesian environments. We provide empirical evidence in support of this explanation. Finally, we study the mechanism and its implications in a quantitative model.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01226

Counterfactual analysis suggests that by easing financing conditions, quantitative easing facilitated a net increase in aggregate investment. The resulting expansion of firms’ production capacities lowered their marginal costs. These disinflationary supply side effects dominated over the inflationary effects induced by the stimulus to aggregate demand. At the ZLB, the concomitant rise in real interest rates, in turn, induced a net fall in aggregate consumption.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01205
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Evolution of Technological Substitution in Low-Wage Labor Markets,Daniel Aaronson and Brian J. Phelan,"This paper uses minimum wage hikes to evaluate the susceptibility of low-wage employment to technological substitution. We find that automation is accelerating and supplanting a broader set of low-wage routine jobs since the 2008–2009 financial crisis. Simultaneously, low-wage interpersonal jobs are increasing and offsetting routine job loss. However, interpersonal job growth does not appear to be enough, as it was prior to the financial crisis, to fully offset the negative effects of automation on low-wage routine jobs. Employment losses are most evident among non-Asian people of color who experience outsized losses at routine jobs and smaller gains at interpersonal jobs.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01222

For two common air pollutants (SO2 and industrial dust) we document that (a) exporters are significantly less emissions-intensive relative to their nonexporting counterparts and (b) this difference cannot be explained by differential rates of abatement alone. Employing variation in trade and environmental conditions across time and space, we quantify the impact of endogenous export and abatement decisions on firm-level emissions. We find that exporting reduces emissions by at least 36% across pollutants. We explore underlying determinants of export-driven reductions in emissions intensity.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01194

Our empirical approach combines transaction-level export data from El Salvador with unique data that distinguishes export flows that were processed on the transit system. Our results indicate that the new transit system lowered regulatory border costs and raised exports. At the low end, our back-of-the-envelope estimate of the return to investment is US$ 3-to-1.

The representation facilitates simple computation of the determinant, the matrix inverse, and other powers of a block matrix, as well as the matrix logarithm and the matrix exponential. These results are particularly useful for block covariance and block correlation matrices, where evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood and estimation are greatly simplified.

Our strategy is based on state governments using similar site-selection criteria to assign normal schools (to train teachers) and insane asylums between 1830 and 1930. Normal schools became larger regional universities while asylum properties mostly continue as small state-owned psychiatric health facilities. We find that a regional university roughly offsets the negative effects of manufacturing exposure. We show the resilience of regional public university spending is an important mechanism, and we show correlations consistent with bachelor’s degree share also playing a mediating role.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01212

We find that winning counties today have college degree attainment rates 56% higher than runner-up counties and more private-sector employment in human-capital-intensive industries. These effects are not driven primarily by recent in-migration of educated adults, and alternative public investments did not have similar effects on local educational attainment.

We find that local workers benefit from productivity growth, even after subtracting increases in housing costs. These gains are larger for local less educated workers, such that productivity growth reduces local inequality. We then propose and implement a new transparent method of estimating indirect effects of local productivity growth on earnings and housing costs of workers in other cities.

We exploit exogenous firm-level export demand shocks and find that firms respond by patenting more; furthermore, this response is driven by the subset of initially more productive firms. The patent response arises two to five years after the shock, highlighting the time required to innovate. In contrast, the demand shock raises contemporaneous sales and employment for all firms regardless of their productivity. This skewed innovation response to common demand shocks arises naturally from a model of endogenous innovation and competition with firm heterogeneity.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01199

I introduce a test to detect an underresearched form of hiring bias: implicit quotas. I derive a test under the null hypothesis of gender-blind hiring that requires no additional information about individual hires and can be used to analyze hiring bias in a variety of other hiring settings. I derive its asymptotic distribution and propose a parametric bootstrap procedure that resamples from the exact distribution.

In this paper, we study information provision to rural communities in the context of a global outbreak of an infectious disease---COVID-19. Two weeks after the initial lockdown in March 2020, we conducted a randomized experiment in rural Bangladesh and India to disseminate health information over the phone.

Using administrative panel data, we find a significant disincentive effect among the low-skilled only, for whom employment fell by 2% to 3% and benefit take-up increased by 10% to 14%. Two-thirds of the effect is attributable to transitions from work to welfare and one-third to reduced labor market entry.

I study how increased local control affects housing production by exploiting a common electoral reform—changing from “at-large” to “ward” elections for town council. These reforms, which are not typically motivated by housing markets, shrink each representative’s constituency from the entire town to one ward. Results from a variety of difference-in-differences estimators show that this decentralization decreases housing units permitted by 20%, with similar effects on multi- and single-family permits.

We show that the bridge generated a substantial increase in the cross-country commuting behavior of Swedes and a 13.5% increase in the average wage of workers in the region. We further show that the wage gains are unevenly distributed: the effect is largest for high-educated men and smallest for low-educated women. Thus, the wage gains come at the cost of increased income inequality and a widening of the gender wage gap, both within and across households.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01183

We combine newly digitized data on all major coal-fired power plants for the period 1938–1962 with two complementary difference-in-differences strategies. Coal-fired plants imposed large negative health externalities that were partially offset by the benefits of local electricity generation. The health impacts varied widely according to initial electricity access and evolved as the stock of generating capacity expanded over the sample period. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for both current and future payoffs when designing environmental regulation.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01218

We find that police violence causes lower protest participation in street rallies but more adherence to test boycotts. These effects appear among schoolmates of the victim and not among students living near the killing. Negative educational consequences suffered by the schoolmates combined with previous results suggest that psychological mechanisms are a plausible explanation.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01186

This paper shows that in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, workers feel as secure as they ever have in the past 30 years. This is partly because job insecurity is very cyclical and (pre-COVID) unemployment rates very low, but there is also no clear underlying trend towards increased subjective measures of job insecurity.

This trend of losses is reversed after redistricting despite no change in overall House vote shares in states near the cutoff.

We find that growth in income relative to the firm average (the within-firm component) translates significantly less into consumption than growth in firm average income (the between-firm component). These findings are explained by the lower persistence of the within-firm component of income, better self-insurance for workers more exposed to variations in income growth from the within-firm component, and peer effects in the workplace. Quantitatively, income persistence provides 43% of the explanatory power, self-insurance provides 35%, and peer effects provide 22%.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01157
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Financial Constraints and Propagation of Shocks in Production Networks,"Banu Demir, Beata Javorcik, Tomasz Michalski and Evren Ors","We examine the propagation of a small unexpected supply shock through a production network and the role financial constraints play in its transmission. Using data on almost all Turkish supplier-customer links, we exploit the heterogeneous impact of an unexpected import-tax increase for identification. We find that this relatively minor shock had a nontrivial economic impact on exposed firms and propagated downstream through affected suppliers. Importantly, we show that low-liquidity firms amplified its transmission.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01162
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,History Dependence in Drug Demand: Identification and Implications for Entry Incentives,Josh Feng,"I use temporal discontinuities in choice sets to identify history dependence in drug demand, finding large and long-term effects. Quasi-randomly assigning a patient to a drug today increases the probability she is taking the same drug four years later by 54 percentage points. History dependence is stronger in patients taking multiple medications and weaker in drugs that are significantly more effective than substitutes. It is also weaker in generics and line extensions, driven by switching from the reference branded drug. I use a pair-specific switching-cost model to capture these patterns and provide suggestive evidence that they affect manufacturers’ entry timing incentives.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01159
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Testing the Dimensionality of Policy Shocks,"Jia Li, Viktor Todorov and Qiushi Zhang","This paper provides a nonparametric test for deciding the dimensionality of a policy shock as manifest in the abnormal change in asset returns’ stochastic covariance matrix, following the release of a macroeconomic announcement. We use high-frequency data in local windows before and after the event to estimate the covariance jump matrix and then test its rank. We find a one-factor structure in the covariance jump matrix of the yield curve resulting from the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy shocks before the 2007–2009 financial crisis. The dimensionality of policy shocks increased afterwards because of the use of unconventional monetary policy tools.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01139
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Tracking Weekly State-Level Economic Conditions,"Christiane Baumeister, Danilo Leiva-Leon and Eric Sims","This paper develops a novel dataset of weekly economic conditions indices for the 50 U.S. states going back to 1987 based on mixed-frequency dynamic factor models with weekly, monthly, and quarterly variables that cover multiple dimensions of state economies. We find considerable cross-state heterogeneity in the length, depth, and timing of business cycles. We illustrate the usefulness of these state-level indices for quantifying the main contributors to the economic collapse caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and for evaluating the effectiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program. We also propose an aggregate indicator that gauges the overall weakness of the U.S. economy.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01171
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Empirical Decomposition of the IV-OLS Gap with Heterogeneous and Nonlinear Effects,Shoya Ishimaru,"This study proposes an econometric framework to interpret and empirically decompose the difference between instrumental variables (IV) and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates given by a linear regression model when the true causal effects of the treatment are nonlinear in treatment levels and heterogeneous across covariates. I show that the IV-OLS coefficient gap consists of three estimable components: the difference in weights on the covariates, the difference in weights on the treatment levels, and the difference in identified marginal effects that arises from endogeneity bias. Applications of this framework to return-to-schooling estimates demonstrate the empirical relevance of this distinction in properly interpreting the IV-OLS gap.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01169
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Inference on Conditional Quantile Processes in Partially Linear Models with Applications to the Impact of Unemployment Benefits,"Zhongjun Qu, Jungmo Yoon and Pierre Perron","We propose methods to estimate and make inferences on conditional quantile processes for models with both nonparametric and (locally or globally) linear components. We derive their asymptotic properties, optimal bandwidths, and uniform confidence bands over quantiles allowing for robust bias correction. Our framework covers the sharp regression discontinuity design, which is used to study the effects of unemployment insurance benefits extensions, focusing on heterogeneity over quantiles and covariates. We show economically strong effects in the tails of the outcome distribution. They reduce the within-group inequality, but can be viewed as enhancing between-group inequality, although they help to bridge the gender gap.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01168
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Bootstrap Inference for Quantile Treatment Effects in Randomized Experiments with Matched Pairs,"Liang Jiang, Xiaobin Liu, Peter Phillips and Yichong Zhang","This paper examines methods of inference concerning quantile treatment effects (QTEs) in randomized experiments with matched-pairs designs (MPDs). Standard multiplier bootstrap inference fails to capture the negative dependence of observations within each pair and is therefore conservative. Analytical inference involves estimating multiple functional quantities that require several tuning parameters. Instead, this paper proposes two bootstrap methods that can consistently approximate the limit distribution of the original QTE estimator and lessen the burden of tuning parameter choice. Most especially, the inverse propensity score weighted multiplier bootstrap can be implemented without knowledge of pair identities.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01089

Six countries experienced a decrease in polarization. We relate trends in polarization to trends in potential explanatory factors.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01160
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Understanding the Rise in Life Expectancy Inequality,"Gordon Dahl, Claus Thustrup Kreiner, Torben Heien Nielsen and Benjamin Ly Serena","We provide a novel decomposition of changing gaps in life expectancy between rich and poor into differential changes in age-specific mortality rates and differences in “survivability.” Declining age-specific mortality rates increases life expectancy, but the gain is small if the likelihood of living to this age is small (ex ante survivability) or if the expected remaining lifetime is short (ex post survivability). Lower survivability of the poor explains half of the recent rise in inequality in the United States and the entire rise in Denmark. Declines in cardiovascular mortality benefited rich and poor, but inequality increased because of differences in lifestyle-related survivability.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01148
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Anti-Muslim Voting and Media Coverage of Immigrant Crimes,"Mathieu Couttenier, Sophie Hatte, Mathias Thoenig and Stephanos Vlachos","We study how news coverage of immigrant criminality impacts voting in one of the most controversial referendums in recent years—the 2009 Swiss minaret ban. We combine a comprehensive crime detection data set with detailed information on newspaper coverage. We first document a large upward distortion in media reporting of immigrant crime during the prereferendum period. Exploiting quasi-random variations in crime incidence, we find a positive first-order effect of news coverage on support for the ban. Our quantification shows that, in absence of the media bias, the pro-ban vote would have decreased from 57.6% to 53.5% at the national level.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01152
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Credible School Value-Added with Undersubscribed School Lotteries,"Joshua Angrist, Peter Hull, Parag Pathak and Christopher Walters","We introduce two empirical strategies harnessing the randomness in school assignment mechanisms to measure school value-added. The first estimator controls for the probability of school assignment, treating take-up as ignorable. We test this assumption using randomness in assignments. The second approach uses assignments as instrumental variables (IVs) for low-dimensional models of value-added and forms empirical Bayes posteriors from these IV estimates. Both strategies solve the underidentification challenge arising from school undersubscription. Models controlling for assignment risk and lagged achievement in Denver and New York City yield reliable value-added estimates. Estimates from models with lower-quality achievement controls are improved by IV.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01149

Combining data on all migrant departures and postsecondary institutions in the Philippines, we show that nursing enrollment and graduation increased substantially in response to greater U.S. demand for nurses. The supply of nursing programs expanded. Nurse quality, measured by licensure exam pass rates, declined. Despite this, for each nurse migrant, nine additional nurses were licensed. New nurses switched from other degree types but graduated at higher rates than they would have otherwise, increasing the human capital stock in the Philippines.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01131
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,How to Attract Physicians to Underserved Areas? Policy Recommendations from a Structural Model,"Francisco Costa, Letícia Nunes and Fabio Miessi Sanches",This paper exploits location choices of all generalist physicians who graduated in Brazil between 2001 and 2013 to study policies aimed at increasing the supply of physicians in underserved areas. We set up and estimate a supply and demand model for physicians. We estimate physicians' locational preferences using a random coefficients discrete choice model. The demand has private establishments competing for physicians with private and public facilities around the country. Policy counterfactuals indicate that quotas in medical schools for students born in underserved areas and the opening of vacancies in medical schools in deprived areas are more cost-effective than financial incentives.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01155

Evidence from a Natural Experiment,"Yao Lu, Xinzheng Shi, Jagadeesh Sivadasan and Zhufeng Xu","We collect worker month-level panel data from two companies in Beijing for a two-year period before and after the opening of a nearby subway station, which significantly improved public transportation commutes for some workers. We find a significant difference-in-differences increase (12.6% of the standard deviation) in bonus pay, which is strongly correlated to worker-level performance measures, for affected workers relative to unaffected coworkers. We find no evidence that the improved performance is a result of affected workers spending extra time at the workplace. We find suggestive evidence for a relative decline in turnover, consistent with a gain in utility for affected workers.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01138
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Do Academically Struggling Students Benefit from Continued Student Loan Access? Evidence from University and Beyond,Yu-Wei Chu and Harold E. Cuffe,"We estimate the effects of student loan access on educational attainment and labor market returns in New Zealand. We exploit the introduction of a national policy mandating a 50% pass rate for student loan renewals using a regression discontinuity design. Retaining loan access increases reenrollment for students around the threshold, and a majority eventually graduate with a bachelor's degree within seven years. We find that retaining student loan access leads to large labor market returns for struggling students. The additional debt from further borrowing is small relative to the earnings returns and declines quickly due to faster repayment.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01144
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Same-Sex Marriage Recognition and Taxes: New Evidence about the Impact of Household Taxation,Leora Friedberg and Elliott Isaac,"The U.S. income tax code encourages marriage for some and discourages marriage for others, but same-sex couples were only recently exposed to these incentives. We estimate marriage responses by exploiting variation in the recognition of same-sex marriages for tax purposes versus earlier papers leveraging smaller changes. Using the American Community Survey, which reports cohabitation and marriage, we estimate a significant though very small marriage elasticity, with further analysis suggesting a higher (though still small) elasticity for low-earning households and in response to federal taxes specifically. Our estimates imply that the 2018 tax reform will increase marriage among high-earning cohabiting couples.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01176
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Incentivizing Demand for Supply-Constrained Care: Institutional Birth in India,Alison Andrew and Marcos Vera-Hernandez,"If overcrowding harms health care quality, the impacts of encouraging more people to use services are not obvious. Impacts will depend on whether marginal entrants benefit and whether they benefit enough to offset the congestion externalities imposed on inframarginal users. We develop a general-equilibrium model that formalizes these ideas. We examine them empirically by studying JSY, a program in India that paid women to give birth in medical facilities. We find evidence that JSY increased perinatal mortality in areas with low health-system capacity, was particularly harmful in more-complex births, reduced the quality of facilities' postnatal care, and generated harmful spillovers onto other services.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01206
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Gentrification and Pioneer Businesses,"Kristian Behrens, Brahim Boualam, Julien Martin and Florian Mayneris","Little is known about where hotspots of gentrification emerge within a city and the role that some types of businesses play in the process. We develop a method to detect the sectors whose presence heralds the process of gentrification in a neighborhood. We show that these sectors, mostly found in cultural and creative industries, help to anticipate neighborhood change and that their predictive power complements that of traditional gentrification determinants. We also examine mechanisms related to amenities, worker characteristics, and signaling that are consistent with these results. The analysis illustrates the importance of businesses in the sociodemographic dynamics of neighborhoods.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01154
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Cohesive Institutions and Political Violence,Thiemo Fetzer and Stephan Kyburz,"Can revenue sharing of resource rents be a source of distributive conflict? Can cohesive institutions avoid such conflicts? We exploit exogenous variation in local government revenues and new data on local democratic institutions in Nigeria to study these questions. We find a strong link between rents and conflict. Conflicts are highly organized and concentrated in districts and time periods with unelected local governments. Once local governments are elected these relationships are much weaker. We argue that elections produce more cohesive institutions that help limit distributional conflict between groups. Throughout, we confirm these findings using individual level survey data.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01156
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Judging under Public Pressure,"Alma Cohen, Zvika Neeman and Florian Auferoth","We study the circumstances under which public pressure affects judging. We show that crowd pressure biases decisions in favor of the crowd for “subjective decisions” with respect to which the judge has more discretion but not for “objective decisions.” The bias is strengthened after a judge's error against the crowd and when errors are costlier to the crowd. We use data about referees' decisions and errors from the Bundesliga. We exploit three regimes where, due to the introduction of Video Assistance Refereeing (VAR) and COVID-19, both crowd pressure and the likelihood of errors vary.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01141

The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Intertemporal Income Shifting and the Taxation of Business Owner-Managers,"Helen Miller, Thomas Pope and Kate Smith","We use newly linked tax records to show that the large responses of UK company owner-managers to personal taxes are due to intertemporal income shifting and not to reductions in real business activity. Around half of this shifting is short-term and helps prevent volatile incomes being taxed more heavily under progressive personal taxes. The remainder reflects systemic profit retention over long periods to take advantage of lower tax rates, including preferential treatment of capital gains. We find no evidence that this tax-induced retention increases business investment. It does, however, substantially reduce the tax revenue raised from high income business owners.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01166
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,How Green Is Sugarcane Ethanol?,Marcelo Sant'Anna,"Biofuels offer one approach for reducing carbon emissions. However, the necessary agricultural expansion may endanger tropical forests. I use a dynamic model of land use to disentangle the roles of acreage and yields in the supply of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil. The model is estimated using remote sensing (satellite) information of sugarcane activities. Estimates imply that, at the margin, 92% of new ethanol comes from increases in area and only 8% from increases in yield. Direct deforestation accounts for 19% of area expansion at the margin in the long run. I further assess carbon emissions and deforestation implications from ethanol policies.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01136
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,(Non-)Parametric Recoverability of Preferences and Choice Prediction,Lanny Zrill,"Simple functional forms for utility require restrictive structural assumptions that are often contrary to observed behavior. Even so, they are widely used in applied economic research. I address this issue using a two-part adaptive experimental design to compare the predictions of a popular parametric model of decision making under risk to those of non-parametric bounds on indifference curves. Interpreting the latter as an approximate upper bound, I find the parametric model sacrifices very little in terms of predictive success. This suggests that, despite their restrictiveness, simple functional forms may nevertheless be useful representations of preferences over risky alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01143
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,The Effect of Information on Market Activity: Evidence from Vehicle Recalls,Inge van den Bijgaart and Davide Cerruti,"We evaluate the effect of vehicle recalls on vehicle transactions in the second-hand market. Using a rich data set of Dutch vehicle registrations, we exploit the quasiexperimental variation in recalls across nearly identical cars. We find strong heterogeneities across market segments: transactions increased for cars with lower listed price or with defects, and decreased for those with higher price or no defects. Based on our theoretical model, this suggests that recalls increase sorting in low-end markets, yet exacerbate adverse selection in high-end markets. Our results shed light on the effect of information arrival in markets subject to uncertainty and information asymmetries.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01164
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Contracts and Firms' Inflation Expectations,Saten Kumar and Dennis Wesselbaum,"We use novel survey data to study firms’ inventory contracts. We document facts about the usage of purchase and sale contracts. We find that firms purchase and sell inventory through three contractual arrangements: fixed price and quantity, fixed price only, and fixed quantity only. Those using fixed price and quantity hold the largest share of contracts. The average duration of purchase contracts is not very different from the average duration of sale contracts. We then find that the upward bias in inflation expectations is a feature of firms that do not purchase or sell largely through contracts. Our findings are useful in the calibration of sticky price models.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01115
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2024,Strategic or Confused Firms? Evidence from “Missing” Transactions in Uganda,"Miguel Almunia, Jonas Hjort, Justine Knebelmann and Lin Tian","Are firms sophisticated maximizers, or do they appear to make mistakes? Using transaction data from Ugandan value-added tax returns, we show that sellers and buyers report different amounts 79% of the time, despite invoices being easily cross-checked. Our estimates suggest that most firms are “advantageous misreporters,” but that 25% are “disadvantageous misreporters” who systematically overreport own sales minus purchases such that their tax liability increases. Similarly, many firms—especially disadvantageous misreporters—fail to VAT-report imported inputs they themselves reported at Customs, increasing their liability. On net, unilateral VAT misreporting cost Uganda about US$384 million in foregone 2013–2016 tax revenue.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01180

We use newly digitized data from newspaper archives on the length of school closures for 165 large U.S. cities during the 1918–1919 flu pandemic to assess the long-run consequences of closing schools on children. We find that the closures had no detectable impact on children's school attendance in 1920, nor on their educational attainment and adult labor market outcomes in 1940.

We identify spending behavior through an event study approach, by matching loan-level data that covers the universe of Danish mortgages to detailed administrative registries on borrowers. In response to an average increase in installments worth 9% of income, consumption drops by 3% of income, when amortization begins. The reduction in expenditure is persistent. Borrowers who fail to smooth consumption are highly leveraged and likely to be denied a new interest-only loan, upon expiration.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01146
