Journal of Economic Literature,2025,"Income Equality in the Nordic Countries: Myths, Facts, and Lessons","Magne Mogstad, Kjell G. Salvanes and Gaute Torsvik","Policymakers, public commentators, and researchers often cite the Nordic countries as examples of a socioeconomic model that combines low income inequality with prosperity and growth. This article critically assesses that claim by integrating theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence to explain how the Nordic model functions and why these countries experience low inequality. Our analysis suggests that income equality in the Nordics is largely driven by a significant compression of hourly wages, reducing returns to labor market skills and education. This appears to result from a wage bargaining system characterized by strong coordination within and across industries. This finding challenges other commonly cited explanations for Nordic income equality, such as redistribution through the tax transfer system, public spending on goods that complement employment, and public policies promoting equal skills and human capital. We consider broader lessons for economies aiming to reduce inequality and conclude by highlighting several under-explored or unresolved questions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20251636
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,The Economics of Inequality and the Environment,"Moritz A. Drupp, Ulrike Kornek, Jasper N. Meya and Lutz Sager","Environmental degradation and economic inequality are two of the defining challenges of the twenty-first century. We synthesize conceptual mechanisms that underpin inequality–environment linkages and take stock of the relevant empirical evidence. We propose three channels of interaction. We first describe how environmental benefits vary with household income. Second, we discuss how the cost of environmental policy is distributed across households. Third, we consider how income inequality and redistribution shape environmental outcomes. The three channels determine how both environmental quality and economic inequality matter for policy appraisal. We argue that it is crucial to consider inequality-environment linkages in economic research and policy design, as neither issue can be fully understood in isolation. We close by highlighting future research needs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241696
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Declining Wage Inequality in Developing Countries: The Case of Brazil,Sergio Firpo and Alysson Portella,"Despite rising inequality in rich countries, many developing economies have experienced a decline in inequality in recent decades. Brazil is a notable example. From 1995 to 2015, its Gini index decreased from 58 to 48 points. An extensive body of research has investigated a diverse set of explanations for this reduction. This article reviews this literature, using Brazil as a privileged case study to understand the broader phenomenon of inequality decline in many parts of the developing world. We present stylized facts about inequality during this period, focusing on the results of decomposition methods. We then examine research that employs quasi-experiments and structural models to assess mechanisms related to labor supply and demand, trade, technological changes, and institutional factors such as the minimum wage and race and gender discrimination. We end by discussing some unanswered questions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241697
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Housing and Inequality,Yannis M. Ioannides and L. Rachel Ngai,"We approach the literature on housing and inequality from two angles. One is the impact of unequal endowments on housing. The second is the ""memberships"" inequality associated with neighborhoods, namely, households' location in a geographic and social context. We elaborate on these two angles of inequality and focus on three distinctive features of housing: consumption, capital, and location. For owner-occupants, capital and consumption are bundled together in a single good. For both renters and owner-occupants, housing consumption inequality, access to good neighborhoods, and housing wealth follow from unequal endowments. Housing can propagate inequality by enabling owner-occupants to use it as collateral for other investments or to secure higher returns to human capital investments through the better schools in better neighborhoods. We use this approach to analyze key aspects of housing and inequality, paying special attention to the impacts of racial discrimination and segregation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20251659
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Racial Residential Segregation in the United States,Trevon D. Logan and John M. Parman,"Residential segregation is a central factor in explaining socioeconomic gaps across race and ethnicity in the United States. Place of residence directly impacts access to schools, jobs, and health care. There is an ever-evolving literature across the social sciences disciplines documenting the general patterns in residential segregation as well as the causes and consequences of those patterns. This article reviews key parts of that literature. We provide an overview of the measurement of segregation and the general evolution of segregation patterns over time and at different scales. We then review the literatures on both segregation's determinants and its impact on a range of socioeconomic outcomes. We highlight the potential for new insights to be gained from new approaches to quantifying segregation and new frameworks such as stratification for understanding its complex roots.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241373
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,A Review Essay of The Economics of Structural Racism by Patrick Mason,Stephan Lefebvre,"This essay provides a streamlined presentation of stratification economics (SE) in three pillars and comments on Patrick L. Mason's (2023) book The Economics of Structural Racism: Stratification Economics and US Labor Markets. SE, a field that seeks to understand racism and other social inequalities between ascriptive groups, is characterized by rational, self-interested models of group conflict, where social groups, not individuals, are the fundamental unit of analysis, and where intergenerational transmission of advantage or disadvantage cannot be overlooked. Mason demonstrates how, compared to the dominant alternatives in economics, SE better explains changes in racial inequality over time.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241770
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,The Economics of Attention,George Loewenstein and Zachary Wojtowicz,"Attention is an important resource in the modern economy and plays an increasingly prominent role in economic analysis. We summarize research on attention from both psychology and economics with a particular emphasis on its capacity to explain documented violations of classical economic theory. We also identify promising new directions for research, including attention-based utility, the recent proliferation of attentional externalities introduced by digital technology, the potential impact of artificial intelligence on the economics of attention, and the significant role that boredom, curiosity, and other motivational states play in determining how people allocate attention.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241665

We review the basic theory behind this research design, outline the assumptions under which the design identifies causal effects, describe empirical tests of the conditions for identification, and discuss trade-offs associated with choices researchers must make for estimation.

Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Social Preferences: Fundamental Characteristics and Economic Consequences,Ernst Fehr and Gary Charness,"We review the vast literature on social preferences by assessing what is known about their fundamental properties, their distribution in the broader population, and their consequences for important economic and political behaviors. We provide, in particular, an overview of the empirical characteristics of distributional preferences and how they are affected by merit, luck, and concerns for equality of opportunity. In addition, we discuss the evidence for reciprocity and guilt aversion and assess the empirical relevance of self-image and social image concerns in prosocial behaviors. The overall evidence indicates that a large majority of individuals have some sort of social preferences, while purely self-interested subjects are a minority. We also document converging insights from the lab and the field on the impact of wage inequality on work morale, employees' resistance to wage cuts, and the role of social preferences for cooperation and collective action, distributive politics, and individuals' selection into different occupations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241391

Clearly, merely increasing the total quantity of goods and services produced in the market does not address this core problem. I review new work both inside and outside of economics that seeks to understand the persistence of poverty in the United States. With a particular focus on Desmond (2023) and Kearney (2023), I draw out the hypotheses in this work, suggest interesting avenues for future research, and discuss potential policy implications.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241734
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Aggregate Shocks and the Formation of Preferences and Beliefs,Paola Giuliano and Antonio Spilimbergo,"A growing body of work highlights how aggregate shocks shape preferences and beliefs. This review synthesizes findings from sociology, social psychology, and economics to explore the significance of these shocks, how the period in which they are experienced matters, and their lasting effects. It examines economic shocks such as recessions, inflation, and trade shocks, alongside noneconomic shocks like migrations, wars, terrorist attacks, pandemics, and natural disasters. Key conclusions emerge: aggregate shocks influence political preferences, risk attitudes, and institutional trust; experiences during young adulthood have stronger, enduring impacts; and economic shocks generally shift preferences toward the political right, while noneconomic yield more varied outcomes depending on the context. The review also evaluates empirical methodologies, their limitations, and mechanisms underlying these effects. By analyzing how shocks alter societal values and behaviors across generations, this work provides insights into the long-term consequences of major disruptions on individual and collective decision-making.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241674

We introduce readers to the economics and institutional details of these data. Using examples from the literature, we provide practical guidance on how to use these data to construct economic measures of borrowing, consumption,credit access, financial distress, and geographic mobility. We explain what credit scores measure and why. We highlight how researchers can access credit reporting data via existing datasets or by creating new datasets, including by linking credit reporting data with surveys and external datasets.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241737
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,"Culture, Institutions, and Social Equilibria: A Framework",Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson,"This paper proposes a new framework for studying the interplay between culture and institutions. We interpret culture as a repertoire, consisting of (cultural) attributes and allowing rich cultural responses to political changes. Combinations of attributes produce cultural configurations, which provide social meaning, coordination, and political justification. Our framework has several distinctive features. First, it proposes a ""systems approach"" to culture: the meaning and function of attributes are determined within the whole configuration and political equilibrium. Second, it emphasizes discontinuous or ""saltational"" changes in culture—rather than gradual, evolutionary changes—as attributes are reconnected and acquire new meanings in response to evolving circumstances and as outcomes in ongoing ""cultural struggles."" Third, our frame work puts the spotlight on how fluidly different cultures can respond to conditions, depending on the nature of their attributes and constraints on their connections. Finally, it enriches the study of the codetermination of political, institutional and cultural outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241680

Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Deep Learning for Economists,Melissa Dell,"Deep learning provides powerful methods to impute structured information from large-scale, unstructured text and image datasets. For example, economists might wish to detect the presence of economic activity in satellite images, or to measure the topics or entities mentioned in social media, the congressional record, or firm filings. This review introduces deep neural networks, covering methods such as classifiers, regression models, generative artificial intelligence (AI), and embedding models. Applications include classification, document digitization, record linkage, and methods for data exploration in massive scale text and image corpora. When suitable methods are used, deep learning models can be cheap to tune and can scale affordably to problems involving millions or billions of data points. The review is accompanied by a regularly updated companion website, EconDL (https://econdl.github.io/), with user-friendly demo notebooks, software resources, and a knowledge base that provides technical details and additional applications.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241733
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Local Projections,Oscar Jorda and Alan M.

The intervention can affect the outcome and controls on impact and over time. Moreover, there can be subsequent feedback between outcomes, controls, and the intervention. Many of these interactions can be untangled using local projections. This method's simplicity makes it a convenient and versatile tool in the empiricist's kit, one that is generalizable to complex settings.

Structural reforms matter because they entail profound and systematic changes that affect economic welfare, productivity, growth, unemployment, macroeconomic stability, and income inequality. Here we focus on structural reforms in product, labor, and financial markets. After putting forward a set of stylized facts, we take stock of the literature on each of these three key structural reforms, and then assess their business cycle and political economy implications. We underscore various gaps in the literature and articulate a future research agenda that highlights four main areas: measurement, interactions among reforms, political economy considerations, and the timing of the implementation of reforms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20231527
Journal of Economic Literature,2025,Data Engineering for Cognitive Economics,Andrew Caplin,"Cognitive economics studies imperfect information and decision-making mistakes. A central scientific challenge is that these can't be identified in standard choice data. Overcoming this challenge calls for data engineering, in which new data forms are introduced to separately identify preferences, beliefs, and other model constructs. I present applications to traditional areas of economic research, such as wealth accumulation, earnings, and consumer spending. I also present less traditional applications to assessment of decision-making skills, and to human-AI interactions. Methods apply both to individual and to collective decisions. I make the case for broader application of data engineering beyond cognitive economics. It allows symbiotic advances in modeling and measurement. It cuts across existing boundaries between disciplines and styles of research.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241351
