American Economic Review,2025,Micro versus Macro Labor Supply Elasticities: The Role of Dynamic Returns to Effort,"Henrik Kleven, Claus Kreiner, Kristian Larsen and Jakob Søgaard","We investigate long-run earnings responses to taxes in the presence of dynamic returns to effort. First, we develop a theoretical model of earnings determination with dynamic returns to effort. In this model, earnings responses are delayed and mediated by job switches. Second, using administrative data from Denmark, we verify our model's predictions about earnings and hours-worked patterns over the life cycle. Third, we provide a quasi-experimental analysis of long-run earnings elasticities. Informed by our model, the empirical strategy exploits variation among job switchers. We find that the long-run elasticity is around 0.5, considerably larger than the short-run elasticity of roughly 0.2.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240554
American Economic Review,2025,Moonshot: Public R&D and Growth,Shawn Kantor and Alexander Whalley,"We estimate the long-term effect of public R&D on growth in manufacturing by analyzing new data from the Cold War-era space race. We develop a novel empirical strategy that leverages US-Soviet rivalry in space technology to isolate windfall R&D spending. Our results demonstrate that public R&D conducted by NASA contractors increased manufacturing value added, employment, and capital accumulation in space-related sectors. While migration responses were important, they were not sufficient to generate a wedge between local and national effects. The iconic moonshot R&D program had only modest economic effects for both the local and national space-related sectors.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220540
American Economic Review,2025,Imperfect Competition and Rents in Labor and Product Markets: The Case of the Construction Industry,"Kory Kroft, Yao Luo, Magne Mogstad and Bradley Setzler","We develop, identify, and estimate a model of imperfect competition in both labor and product markets. Our context is the US construction industry, where firms compete for workers, private market projects, and government procurements. Our empirical approach leverages bidding data from procurement auctions linked to employer-employee tax records. We find imperfect competition in both markets generates a total wage markdown of more than 30 percent and a total price markup of around 45 percent. By contrast, if one erroneously assumed a perfectly competitive product (labor) market, then one would conclude wages (prices) are marked down (up) by only 20 percent (16 percent).",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220577
American Economic Review,2025,Nested Bundling,Frank Yang,"A nested bundling strategy creates menus in which more expensive bundles include all the goods of less expensive ones. We study when nested bundling is optimal and determine which nested menu is optimal, when consumers differ in one dimension. We define a partial order on bundles by (i) set inclusion and (ii) sales quantity when sold alone. We show that, under quasi-concavity assumptions, if the undominated bundles with respect to this partial order are nested, then nested bundling is optimal. We present an iterative algorithm that identifies the minimal optimal menu consisting of a subset of the undominated bundles.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230455
American Economic Review,2025,"Labor Market Power, Self-Employment, and Development","Francesco Amodio, Pamela Medina and Monica Morlacco","This paper shows that self-employment shapes labor market power in low-income countries, with implications for industrial development. Using Peruvian data, we find that wage-setting power increases with employer concentration but less so where self-employment is more prevalent. A general equilibrium model shows that in oligopsonistic labor markets, self-employment raises the supply elasticity of wage labor, weakening employer market power. However, by the same mechanism, procompetitive policies aimed at expanding wage employment and reducing reliance on self-employment may unintentionally strengthen labor market power, undermining their objectives.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230490
American Economic Review,2025,Is Air Pollution Regulation Too Lenient? Evidence from US Offset Markets,Joseph S. Shapiro and Reed Walker,"We develop a framework to estimate the marginal cost of air pollution regulation and apply it to assess policy efficiency. We exploit a provision of the Clean Air Act that requires new plants to pay incumbent facilities to reduce emissions. This ""offset"" policy creates hundreds of local pollution markets, differing by pollutant and location. Theory and transaction data suggest that offset prices reveal marginal abatement costs. We compare these prices to marginal benefits of pollution reduction estimated using leading air quality models and find that, on average, marginal benefits exceed marginal costs by more than a factor of ten.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230761
American Economic Review,2025,The Long-Term Effects of Income for At-Risk Infants: Evidence from Supplemental Security Income,"Amelia Hawkins, Christopher Hollrah, Sarah Miller, Laura R. Wherry, Gloria Aldana and Mitchell Wong","The Supplemental Security Income program uses a birth weight cutoff at 1,200 grams to determine eligibility. Using birth certificates linked to administrative records, we find low-income families of infants born just below the cutoff receive higher monthly cash benefits (equal to 27 percent of family income) at ages 0–2 with smaller benefits continuing through age 10. Yet we detect no improvements in health care use and mortality in infancy, nor in health and human capital outcomes as observed through young adulthood for these infants. We also find no improvements for their older siblings.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231293
American Economic Review,2025,Test-Optional Admissions,"Wouter Dessein, Alex Frankel and Navin Kartik","Many US colleges now use test-optional admissions. A frequent claim is that by not seeing standardized test scores, a college can admit a student body it prefers, say, with more diversity. But how can observing less information improve decisions? This paper proposes that test-optional policies are a response to social pressure on admission decisions. We model a college that bears disutility when it makes admission decisions that ""society"" dislikes. Going test optional allows the college to reduce its ""disagreement cost."" We analyze how missing scores are imputed and the consequences for the college, students, and society.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231407
American Economic Review,2025,Market-Wide Predictable Price Pressure,Samuel M. Hartzmark and David H. Solomon,"We demonstrate that predictable uninformed cash flows forecast aggregate market stock returns. Buying pressure from dividend payments (announced weeks prior) predicts higher value-weighted market returns, with returns for the top quintile of payment days four times higher than the lowest. This holds internationally and increases when reinvestment is high and market liquidity is low. We estimate a market-level price multiplier of 1.9. These results suggest price pressure is a widespread result of flows, not an anomaly.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231725
American Economic Review,2025,A Model of Populism as a Conspiracy Theory,Adam Szeidl and Ferenc Szucs,"We model populism as the dissemination of a false ""alternative reality,"" according to which the intellectual elite conspires against the populist for purely ideological reasons. If enough voters are receptive to it, this alternative reality—by discrediting the elite's truthful message—reduces political accountability. Elite criticism, because it is more consistent with the alternative reality, strengthens receptive voters' support for the populist. Alternative realities are endogenously conspiratorial to resist evidence better. Populists, to leverage or strengthen beliefs in the alternative reality, enact harmful policies that may disproportionately harm the non-elite. These results explain previously unexplained facts about populism.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240010
American Economic Review,2025,Drivers of Change: Employment Responses to the Lifting of the Saudi Female Driving Ban,"Chaza Abou Daher, Erica Field, Kendal Swanson and Kate Vyborny",We conduct a field experiment to quantify the impact of the lifting of the Saudi women's driving ban on women's employment by randomizing rationed spaces in driver's training. Treated women are 41 percent more likely to be employed yet are 19 percent less likely to be able to make purchases without family permission. Patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects reveal that these divergent impacts of access to driving are experienced by distinct subgroups of women. The results underscore the importance of intrahousehold responses that can counteract legal gains in women's freedoms.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240119
American Economic Review,2025,Robustness Measures for Welfare Analysis,Zi Yang Kang and Shoshana Vasserman,"Economists routinely make functional form assumptions on demand curves to derive welfare conclusions. How sensitive are these conclusions to such assumptions? In this paper, we develop robustness measures that quantify the extent to which the true demand curve must deviate from common functional form assumptions in order to overturn a welfare conclusion. We parametrize this variability in terms of the gradient and curvature of the demand curve. By leveraging tools from information design, we show that our measures are easy to compute. Our measures are also flexible and easy to use, as we illustrate through empirical applications.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220673
American Economic Review,2025,Keep Your Enemies Closer: Strategic Platform Adjustments during US and French Elections,"Rafael Di Tella, Randy Kotti, Caroline Le Pennec and Vincent Pons","We study changes in political discourse during campaigns, using a novel dataset of candidate websites for US House elections, 2002–2016, and manifestos for French parliamentary and local elections, 1958–2022. We find that candidates move to the center in ideology and rhetorical complexity between the first round (or primary) and the second round (or general election). This convergence reflects candidates' strategic adjustment to their opponents, as predicted by Downsian competition: Using an RDD we show that candidates converge to the platform of opponents who narrowly qualified for the last round as opposed to those who narrowly failed to qualify.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231045
American Economic Review,2025,Employers and Unemployment Insurance Take-Up,"Marta Lachowska, Isaac Sorkin and Stephen A. Woodbury","We quantify the employer's role in unemployment insurance (UI) take-up. Employer effects on claiming and appeals are substantial, and those effects are negatively correlated, consistent with appeals deterring claims. Low-wage workers are less likely to claim and more likely to have their claims appealed than median-wage workers. Employer effects help explain these income gradients, so equalizing employer effects on claiming would increase the progressivity of UI. Finally, the main source of targeting error in UI is that eligible workers do not claim.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230195

I document static allocative inefficiencies induced by incomplete market integration in 2 major US markets; these have risen over time and totaled $2 billion in 2022. I also argue that estimating firm-level impacts is important, as incumbents may have the power to block new lines and other reforms. I show that 4 firms would have experienced a collective $1.3 billion drop in net revenues in 2022 had the market been integrated, all there are reports of some of these firms blocking transmission projects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240276

Palfrey","This paper develops a framework to extend the strategic form analysis of cursed equilibrium (CE) developed by Eyster and Rabin (2005) to multistage games. The approach uses behavioral strategies rather than normal form mixed strategies and imposes sequential rationality. We define and characterize properties of cursed sequential equilibrium (CSE) and apply it to four canonical economic applications: signaling games, reputation building, durable goods monopoly, and the dirty faces game. These applications illustrate various implications of CSE, show how and why it differs from sequential equilibrium and CE, and provide evidence from laboratory experiments that support the empirical relevance of CSE.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231130
American Economic Review,2025,The Negligible Effect of Free Contraception on Fertility: Experimental Evidence from Burkina Faso,"Pascaline Dupas, Seema Jayachandran, Adriana Lleras-Muney and Pauline Rossi","We conducted a randomized trial among 14,545 households in rural Burkina Faso to test the oft-cited hypothesis that limited access to contraception is an important driver of high fertility rates in West Africa. We do not find support for this hypothesis. Women who were given free access to modern contraception for three years did not have lower birth rates; we can reject even modest effects. We cross-randomized additional interventions to address inefficiencies that might depress demand for free contraception, specifically misperceptions about the child mortality rate and social norms. Free contraception did not significantly influence fertility even in combination with these interventions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20241305
American Economic Review,2025,Monopsony and Employer Misoptimization Explain Why Wages Bunch at Round Numbers,"Arindrajit Dube, Alan Manning and Suresh Naidu","We show that administrative hourly wage data exhibit considerable bunching at round numbers. We run two experiments randomizing wages around $0.10 and $1.00 to experimentally measure left-digit bias for identical tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk; we fail to find any evidence of discontinuity in the labor supply function at round numbers despite estimating a considerable degree of monopsony. We replicate these results in administrative worker-firm hourly wage data from Oregon. We can rule out inattention estimates found in the behavioral product market literature. We provide evidence that firms ""misoptimize"" wage setting. More monopsony requires less employer misoptimization to explain bunching.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20200678
American Economic Review,2025,From Retributive to Restorative: An Alternative Approach to Justice in Schools,"Anjali Adukia, Benjamin Feigenberg and Fatemeh Momeni","School districts historically approached conflict resolution from the perspective that suspending disruptive students was necessary to protect their classmates, even if this caused harm to perceived offenders. Restorative practices (RP)—focusing on reparation, accountability, and shared ownership of disciplinary justice—are designed to address undesirable behavior without harming students. We study Chicago Public Schools' adoption of RP and find that suspensions and arrests decreased, driven by effects for Black students. We find null effects on test score value added, ruling out meaningful average declines. We estimate a 15 percent decrease in out-of-school arrests, consistent with RP substantively changing student behavior.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230971
American Economic Review,2025,Underbidding for Oil and Gas Tracts,"Julien Martin, Martin Pesendorfer and Jack Shannon","Common values auction models, where bidder decisions depend on noisy signals of common values, provide predictions about Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) outcomes. In settings where these common values can be estimated, these predictions can be tested. We propose a series of tests, robust to assumptions about the signal structure, to determine whether the observed data could have been generated by a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. In the setting of oil and gas lease auctions in New Mexico, we find evidence that participation decisions are correlated and that participants systematically underbid in light of ex post outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231356
American Economic Review,2025,Direct and Indirect Effects of Investment Tax Incentives,Adrian Lerche,"This paper estimates the direct effects and indirect spillover effects of investment tax credits on firms. Exploiting a differential tax credit rate change by firm size in the German manufacturing sector, I find that lowering a firm's investment cost by 7.6 percent increases its capital stock by 17.7 percent and employment by 12.0 percent. Positive local spillovers generate one additional manufacturing job for each directly created job, are strongest between firms in industries connected through input-output linkages, and arise within distances of five kilometers. Firms dependent on local consumer demand also increase employment, while within-industry spillovers generate small negative effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220656
American Economic Review,2025,Monetary Policy and Rational Asset Price Bubbles: Comment,"Franklin Allen, Gadi Barlevy and Douglas Gale","Galí (2014) showed that a monetary policy rule that raises rates when bubbles exceed some steady-state benchmark can paradoxically lead to larger deviations from steady state. Nevertheless, this comment shows that a central bank can always dampen a bubble by setting a higher-than-expected rate, although it may have to raise the rate aggressively. This is a different point from the Miao, Shen, and Wang (2019) comment on Galí (2014). They showed that when the central bank targets a different steady state than Gali considered, raising rates when bubbles exceed this alternative benchmark leads to smaller deviations from steady state.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230983
American Economic Review,2025,The Debt-Inflation Channel of the German (Hyper) Inflation,"Markus Brunnermeier, Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, Emil Verner and Tom Zimmermann","This paper studies how a large increase in the price level is transmitted to the real economy through firm balance sheets. Using newly digitized macro- and micro-level data from the German inflation of 1919–1923, we show that inflation led to a large reduction in real debt burdens and bankruptcies. Firms with higher nominal liabilities at the onset of inflation experienced a larger decline in interest expenses, a relative increase in their equity values, and higher employment during the inflation. The results are consistent with real effects of a debt-inflation channel that operates even when prices and wages are flexible.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230685
American Economic Review,2025,The End of Privilege: A Reexamination of the Net Foreign Asset Position of the United States,"Andrew Atkeson, Jonathan Heathcote and Fabrizio Perri","The US net foreign asset position declined sharply after 2007, reaching negative 60 percent of GDP by the third quarter of 2023. This deterioration primarily reflects a US-specific rise in corporate asset values that inflated the value of US equity liabilities to the rest of the world. To interpret these trends, we develop an international macro-finance model of flows, stocks, asset valuations, the current account,and the net foreign asset position. We find that the welfare impact of rising asset values for a representative US household has been quite negative given extensive foreign ownership of US corporate equity.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230732

On average, all-female papers receive 10 percent fewer citations than all-male papers, a disparity reduced by 40 percent when considering team sizes and disappearing in most fields with authors' publication records. Additionally, strong in-group preferences emerge: All-male teams omit more papers with women, and vice versa.

While the intermediate action may facilitate the first ""step,"" it may also become a new norm. We derive intuitive conditions for stepping stones, which depend on the relative size of social penalties and intrinsic utility benefits. We propose an econometric approach to testing whether an intermediate action is a stepping stone, and apply it to original data on female genital cutting in Somalia. The analysis shows that the intermediate action may become the new norm.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230458
American Economic Review,2025,Home Price Expectations and Spending: Evidence from a Field Experiment,"Felix Chopra, Christopher Roth and Johannes Wohlfart","We conduct a field experiment with US households to study how expectations about long-run home price growth shape spending decisions. We exogenously vary survey respondents' expectations by providing different expert forecasts. Homeowners' spending, measured using rich home-scanner data, is inelastic to home price expectations. By contrast, renters reduce their spending when expecting higher home price growth. These patterns reflect positive wealth effects for owners from higher future wealth and negative income effects for both groups due to higher future housing costs.

American Economic Review,2025,Effects of Enhanced Legal Aid in Child Welfare: Evidence from a Randomized Trial of Mi Abogado,"Ryan Cooper, Joseph J. Doyle and Andrés Hojman","Children spend years in foster care, and bureaucratic hurdles can unnecessarily prolong their stays. The Mi Abogado program was introduced in Chile to enhance legal aid for foster children and accelerate family reunification. In a novel approach, the Chilean government randomized the introduction of the program for children living in institutions to evaluate effects on child well-being. Using registry data, we find the program significantly reduced the duration of foster care without increasing subsequent maltreatment and placements. The exposure also decreased criminal justice involvement and improved school attendance. Results suggest that strengthening foster care services can cost-effectively improve child well-being.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230947
American Economic Review,2025,Mission Motivation and Public Sector Performance: Experimental Evidence from Pakistan,Muhammad Yasir Khan,"This paper studies, through a randomized field experiment involving community health workers in Pakistan, if public sector organizations can improve worker performance by investing in their mission motivation. The findings reveal that training aimed at strengthening mission motivation improves workers' performance in their core responsibility of monthly household visits, as well as in multiple tasks performed during and outside these visits. This holistic improvement in performance leads to improved health outcomes for children in the communities served by these workers. These results highlight the importance of promoting organizational missions as a strategy to improve public sector performance in low-income countries.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231247
American Economic Review,2025,The Long-Run Effects of Government Spending,Juan Antolin-Diaz and Paolo Surico,"Military spending has large and persistent effects on output because it shifts the composition of public spending toward R&D. This boosts innovation and private investment in the medium term and increases productivity and GDP at longer horizons. Public R&D expenditure stimulates economic activities beyond the business cycle even when it is not associated with war spending. In contrast, the effects of public investment are shorter-lived, while public consumption has a modest impact at most horizons. We reach these conclusions using BVAR with long lags and 125 years of US data, including newly reconstructed series of government spending by main categories since 1890.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231278

Between 1960 and 1990, 76 all-male US universities transitioned to coeducation. Using a generalized difference-in-differences design, we find that coeducation led to a 44 percent increase in gender-related research publications. This increase is driven by research focused on female subjects and gender differences. While coeducation led to a compositional shift with more women and researchers interested in gender topics, much of the increase comes from male incumbent researchers shifting their research focus toward gender-related topics. The results support interaction with more diverse students and peers as key underlying mechanisms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221561
American Economic Review,2025,"Nobel Lecture: Institutions, Technology, and Prosperity",Daron Acemoglu,"This paper reviews the main motivations and arguments of my work on comparative development, colonialism, and institutional change, which was often carried out jointly with James Robinson and Simon Johnson. I then provide a simple framework to organize these ideas and connect them with my research on innovation and technology. The framework is centered around a utility-technology possibilities frontier, which delineates the possible distributions of resources in a society both for given technology and working via different technological choices. It highlights how various types of institutions, market structures, norms, and ideologies influence moves along the frontier and shifts of the frontier, and it provides a simple formalization of the social forces that lead to institutional persistence and those that can trigger institutional change. The framework also enables us to conceptualize how, during periods of disruption, existing—and sometimes quite small—differences can have amplified effects on prosperity and institutional trajectories. In this way, it suggests some parallels between different disruptive periods, including the onset of European colonialism, the spread (or lack thereof) of industrial technologies in the nineteenth century, and decisions related to the use, adoption, and development of AI today.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.115.6.1709

American Economic Review,2025,Nobel Lecture: Paths to the Periphery,James A. Robinson,"My research suggests that world inequality is explained by the incidence of extractive and inclusive institutions. But why do some countries have extractive institutions? I distinguish between two main reasons; first, power relations; second, the ""normative order."" Normative orders provide justifications and legitimacy for institutions which may not generate prosperity, but may achieve other goals. These distinctions are critical because they create very different challenges in trying to make institutions more inclusive and create prosperity. I show how countries move from the economic periphery as a consequence of changing both. My own intellectual journey has been in the other direction, however, hence the title of the paper: I was fortunate to be born in Britain, but I have had to unlearn much of my own experience, socialization and training in order to see other societies on their own terms.

Despite their relative abundance, workers capture a substantial share of the surplus from transactions. We draw this conclusion from demand estimates that imply workers' wages include significant markups over costs and a survey that validates our surplus estimates. Workers retain a significant share of the surplus because demand-side search frictions and worker differentiation reduce direct competition. Finally, we show that applying traditional employment regulations to online gig economy platforms would lower job posting and hiring rates, reducing aggregate surplus for all market participants, including workers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221189

During the European sovereign debt crisis, the Portuguese government cut procurement spending by 4.3 percent of GDP. We find that this cut saddled banks with nonperforming loans from government contractors, which led to a persistent reduction in credit supply to other firms.

We work in the context of an NGO cash transfer program in Kenya, employing recent advances in machine learning methods and dynamic outcome data to learn proxy means tests that jointly target both objectives.

Union leaders are positively selected on both ability and personality traits that enable them to influence others, yet they earn lower wages. In group discussions about workers' views on an upcoming national minimum wage negotiation, randomly embedded leaders build consensus around the union's preferred policy.

American Economic Review,2025,Corporate Discount Rates,Niels Gormsen and Kilian Huber,"We construct a dataset of firms' discount rates (i.e., required returns to capital) and perceived cost of capital using corporate conference calls. The relation between discount rates and the cost of capital is far below the one-to-one mapping assumed in standard theory, as it takes many years for changes in the cost of capital to be incorporated into discount rates. This pattern leads to large and time-varying discount rate wedges that affect firm investment. Moreover, increasing discount rate wedges can account for the recent puzzle of ""missing investment.""

The issuer partitions the asset's cash flow into several asset-backed securities, one for each type of investor. The optimal partition conforms to the commonly observed practice of tranching into senior debt, junior debt, and equity.

American Economic Review,2025,Does Entry Remedy Collusion? Evidence from the Generic Prescription Drug Cartel,Amanda Starc and Thomas G. Wollmann,"Entry represents a fundamental threat to cartels. We study the extent and effect of this behavior in the largest price-fixing case in US history, which involves generic drug manufacturing. We link information on the cartel's internal operations to regulatory filings and market data. There is a substantial increase in entry after cartel formation, but regulatory approvals delay most entrants by two to four years. We estimate a structural model and simulate counterfactual equilibria. Absent entry, cartel profits would be dramatically higher. Correspondingly, reducing regulatory delays by just 1–2 years equates to consumer compensating variation of $612 million–$1.5 billion.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220276
American Economic Review,2025,The Role of People versus Places in Individual Carbon Emissions,Eva Lyubich,"There is substantial spatial heterogeneity in household carbon emissions. I leverage movers in two decades of administrative Decennial Census and American Community Survey data to estimate place effects—the amount by which carbon emissions change for the same household living in different places—for almost 1,000 cities and roughly 61,500 neighborhoods across the United States. I estimate that place effects account for 14–23 percent of overall heterogeneity. A change in neighborhood-level place effects from 1 standard deviation above the mean to 1 below would reduce household carbon emissions from residential energy and commuting by about 40 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230346

In a new dataset covering over a million US individuals, we find retirement contributions are not allocated to the account with the highest employer match rate. This lack of coordination—which goes against the assumptions of most models of household decision-making—is common, costly, persistent over time, and cannot be explained by inertia, auto-enrollment, or simple heuristics. Complementing the administrative evidence with an online survey, we find that inefficient allocations reflect both financial mistakes as well as deliberate choices, especially when trust and commitment inside the households are weak.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230524

Using quasi-random work accidents in Danish administrative data, we find that workers enroll in bachelor's programs after physical injuries, pursuing degrees that build on their past training and experience. Exploiting institutional differences in the stackability of degrees, we find that higher education moves injured workers from disability benefits to full-time employment, earning 25 percent more than before injury.

While many studies focus on average effects, we show that welfare also depends on how the nudge affects the variance of choice distortions, and average effects become irrelevant with zero pass-through or optimal taxes. We implement the framework with experiments evaluating automotive fuel economy labels and sugary drink health labels.

I study how clinic congestion affects mortality for veterans experiencing mental health emergencies. I find that longer waiting times make it more likely that patients miss their follow-up mental health visit, consequently increasing the probability that they permanently disengage from care.

As intangibles become increasingly important, firms hoard liquidity to finance investment in intangibles of limited pledgeability. Firms' savings feed cheap leverage to financial intermediaries and allow intermediaries to bid up asset prices, which in turn encourages firms to save more for asset creation.

Banks with loan portfolios concentrated in sectors exposed to competition from China face an increase in nonperforming loans after China's entry into the World Trade Organization. As a result, they reduce the supply of credit to firms, irrespective of the firm's sector of operation. This cut in credit translates into lower employment, investment, and output. Through this mechanism, the financial channel amplifies the shock to firms already hit by import competition from China and passes it on to firms in sectors expected to expand upon trade liberalization.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20200704

I study the speculative hyperinflation equilibria of continuous-time economies with decentralized markets where money is essential. I establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which money dies in finite time. A necessary condition is that the liquidity return of money grows unbounded as the value of money approaches zero. Under CRRA preferences, the longevity of money shrinks with the money growth rate and the frequency of liquidity needs, but it increases with seller's market power. Money duration also depends on the strictness of legal restrictions and the rates of return of competing currencies.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231008

I show that civil conflict in Africa is explained by ethnic groups' cultural distance to the central government: an increase in cultural distance, proxied by linguistic distance, increases an ethnicity's propensity to fight over government power. To identify this effect, I leverage within-ethnicity variation in linguistic distance resulting from power transitions between ethnic groups over time.

In a field experiment in western Kenya, we randomly subsidize owners to rent out land. Induced rentals mostly persist after the subsidy ends and increase output and value added, consistent with misallocation. Gains from trade arise from renters choosing higher-value crops, having higher productivity, and adopting more nonlabor inputs, while renters use similar quantities of labor as owners. Induced rentals are not those with the largest predicted gains, underlining the importance of the joint distribution of gains and frictions, with frictions arising from search, risk, and learning.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221234

We provide new evidence by studying (removal of) an auto-enrollment policy for health insurance, adding an extra step to enroll. This minor ordeal has a major impact, reducing enrollment by 33 percent and differentially excluding young, healthy, and economically disadvantaged people. Using a simple model, we show adverse selection--a classic feature of insurance markets--undermines ordeals' standard rationale of excluding low-value individuals since they are also low-cost and may not be inefficient.

Criminality is often abetted by state corruption, even though firms are willing to pay for protection. I study indigenization in Nigeria's oil sector, which increased local firms' participation substantially. Despite lower quality, local firms increase output by reducing oil theft. A bargaining model illustrates that political connections align law enforcement incentives, solving commitment problems. Data on law enforcement raids show that local firms receive preferential protection. Connections to military elites drive the local advantage.

We study a dynamic mechanism design problem between a government and a central bank. The central bank has persistent private information about structural shocks. Firms learn the state from the central bank's reports and form inflation expectations. A dynamic inflation target implements the full-information commitment allocation. The central bank is delegated the authority to adjust the target's level and flexibility one period in advance. A declining natural interest rate and a flattening Phillips curve imply opposite optimal target adjustments.

In this framework, the admissions process is correlated across schools so that if an applicant is rejected by one school, she is more likely to be rejected by more selective schools.

We find that short-term memory may lead to cycles of polarization and consensus across parties' platforms. Following periods of party consensus, short-term memory implies that there is little variation in voters' data and therefore limited information about the true state of the world. This in turn allows parties to further their own interests and hence polarize by offering different policies. In contrast, periods of polarization and turnover involve sufficient variation in the data that allows voters to be confident about what the correct policy is, forcing both parties to offer this policy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220226

Expectations of larger support in bad states—""policy puts""—explain a large fraction of the announcements' impact. For example, when the Fed introduced purchases of corporate bonds in March 2020, markets expected five times more price support had conditions worsened relative to the median scenario. Perceived promises of additional support in bad states alter asset prices, risk, and the response to future announcements.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230486
American Economic Review,2025,Dynamic Inconsistency in Risky Choice: Evidence from the Lab and Field,"Rawley Heimer, Zwetelina Iliewa, Alex Imas and Martin Weber","We document a robust dynamic inconsistency in risky choice. Using a unique brokerage dataset and a series of experiments, we compare people's initial risk-taking plans to their subsequent decisions. Across settings, people accept risk as part of a loss-exit strategy—planning to continue taking risk after gains and stopping after losses. Actual behavior deviates from initial strategies by cutting gains early and chasing losses. More people accept risk when offered a commitment to their initial strategy. Our results help reconcile seemingly contradictory findings on risk-taking in static versus dynamic contexts. We explore implications for theory and welfare.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210307
