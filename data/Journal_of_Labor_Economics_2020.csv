Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Interpreting Experimental Evidence in the Presence of Postrandomization Events: A Reassessment of the Self-Sufficiency Project,Chris Riddell and W. Craig Riddell,The Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP) was a well-known welfare-to-work experiment that provided a generous but time-limited financial incentive to leave welfare and enter the workforce. Experimental evidence showed large short-term impacts but no lasting effects. We argue that these conclusions need to be reassessed. Policy changes implemented during the SSP implied that the control group’s behavior did not provide an appropriate counterfactual. We estimate the impacts the financial incentive would have had in an unchanging policy environment. This reassessment leads to significant changes in the lessons previously reached. Our study demonstrates that experimental findings need to be interpreted with care.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706513
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Charter Schools and Labor Market Outcomes,Will Dobbie and Roland G. Fryer,"We estimate the impact of charter schools on early-life labor market outcomes in Texas. We find that, at the mean, charter schools have no impact on test scores and a negative impact on earnings. No Excuses charter schools increase test scores and 4-year college enrollment but have a statistically insignificant impact on earnings, although the coefficient is almost identical to what one would expect given the correlation between test scores and wages. Other types of charter schools decrease test scores, 4-year college enrollment, and earnings, and surprisingly the decrease in wages is more negative than one would anticipate.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706534
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Labor Market Returns to Student Loans for University: Evidence from Chile,"Alonso Bucarey, Dante Contreras and Pablo Muñoz","We study the labor market returns to a state-guaranteed loan used to finance university degrees in Chile. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that marginally eligible students forgo vocational education in favor of university education but reduce their probability of graduation. Even though university loan takers accumulate more student debt, their labor market outcomes are not different from those of ineligible students. We find suggestive evidence that the lower quality of the receiving institutions accounts for these results. Finally, we extrapolate the effects away from the eligibility cutoff and show that supramarginal students benefit from this policy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706486
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Exposure to More Female Peers Widens the Gender Gap in STEM Participation,Anne Brenøe and Ulf Zölitz,"We investigate how high school gender composition affects students’ participation in STEM at college. Using Danish administrative data, we exploit idiosyncratic within-school variation in gender composition. We find that having a larger proportion of female peers reduces women’s probability of enrolling in and graduating from STEM programs. Men’s STEM participation increases with more female peers present. In the long run, women exposed to more female peers are less likely to work in STEM occupations, earn less, and have more children. Our findings show that the school peer environment has lasting effects on occupational sorting, the gender wage gap, and fertility.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706646
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,The Developmental Consequences of Superfund Sites,"Claudia Persico, David Figlio and Jeffrey Roth","We use population-level data on all Florida children born between 1994 and 2002 to examine the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants from a Superfund (toxic waste) site. We compare siblings who faced different toxic exposures during gestation because of Superfund site cleanup (or, in other specifications, because of a family move). Children exposed to toxic waste while gestating have substantially worse cognitive and behavioral outcomes than do their unaffected siblings. These results are much larger than what would have been predicted were the effects of Superfund site exposure operating solely through standard measures of birth outcomes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706807
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,The Labor Market Effects of US Reemployment Policy: Lessons from an Analysis of Four Programs during the Great Recession,Marios Michaelides and Peter Mueser,"We present experimental evidence on four US reemployment programs targeting unemployment insurance (UI) recipients during the Great Recession. All programs reduced UI spells, produced UI savings that exceeded program costs, and increased employment rates. The services referral program had the smallest effects, occurring because of voluntary UI exits by participants to avoid requirements. The two programs reviewing participants’ UI eligibility produced greater effects because they induced voluntary exits and disqualified participants who did not meet UI requirements. The program requiring participation in both eligibility review and job-counseling services was the most effective, suggesting that services improved participants’ job search efforts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706485
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Present Bias and Underinvestment in Education? Long-Run Effects of Childhood Exposure to Booms in Colombia,Bladimir Carrillo,This paper examines the long-run impacts of income shocks by exploiting variation in coffee cultivation patterns within Colombia and world coffee prices during cohorts’ school-going years. The results indicate that cohorts that faced higher returns to coffee-related work in childhood completed fewer years of schooling and have lower adult earnings scores. Several pieces of evidence suggest that these results reflect changes in educational decisions induced by temporary changes in the opportunity cost of schooling. These findings are consistent with the possibility that students may ignore or heavily discount the future consequences of dropout decisions when faced with immediate income gains.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706535
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Why Unions Survive: Understanding How Unions Overcome the Free-Rider Problem,Richard Murphy,"This paper provides evidence for why individuals join unions instead of free riding. I model membership as legal insurance. To test the model, I use the incidence of news stories concerning allegations against teachers in the United Kingdom as a plausibly exogenous shock to demand for such insurance. I find that for every five stories occurring in a region, teachers are 2.2 percentage points more likely to be members in the subsequent year. These effects are larger when teachers share characteristics with the news story and can explain 45% of the growth in teacher union membership between 1992 and 2010.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706091
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,The Role of Caseworkers in Unemployment Insurance: Evidence from Unplanned Absences,Amelie Schiprowski,"Caseworkers are the main human resources used to provide social services. This paper asks whether and how much caseworkers matter for the outcomes of unemployed individuals. Using large-scale administrative data, I exploit exogenous variation in unplanned absences among Swiss unemployment insurance caseworkers. I find that individuals who lose a meeting with their caseworker stay unemployed 5% longer. Results show large heterogeneity in the personal impact of caseworkers: the effect of a forgone meeting is zero for caseworkers in the lower half of the productivity distribution but is more than twice the average effect for caseworkers in the upper half.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706092
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,A Method for Disentangling Multiple Treatments from a Regression Discontinuity Design,Michael Gilraine,"In many settings, a policy discontinuity comprises several treatments that cannot be separately identified using a standard regression discontinuity design. I propose a method for identifying distinct treatment components from a single discontinuity by exploiting the asymmetry between entities entering versus exiting treatment. Using data from New York City for 2009–13, I apply my strategy to the discontinuity associated with the introduction of class size caps—a widespread approach for reducing class sizes. I find that class size reductions increase student achievement, although these gains are counteracted by a newly hired teacher effect. The method has broad potential applicability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706740
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Storms and Jobs: The Effect of Hurricanes on Individuals’ Employment and Earnings over the Long Term,"Jeffrey A. Groen, Mark Kutzbach and Anne E. Polivka","Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the US Gulf Coast in 2005. We use job-level data to compare the evolution of earnings for affected workers in four states with workers from matched control counties. We attribute short-term earnings losses to job separations and long-term gains to wage growth in the affected areas. Wages rose due to reduced labor supply and increased labor demand in the affected labor markets. Damage to a worker’s residence or workplace accentuated short-term earnings losses. Effects varied by prestorm industry, with larger gains for workers in sectors related to rebuilding.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706055
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,The Incidence of Local Labor Demand Shocks,Matthew Notowidigdo,"Low-skill workers are comparatively immobile. This paper estimates the role of housing prices and social transfers in accounting for this fact using a spatial equilibrium model. Reduced-form estimates using US census data show that positive local labor demand shocks increase population more than negative shocks reduce population, that this asymmetry is larger for low-skill workers, and that such an asymmetry is absent for average wages, housing values, and rental prices. Generalized method of moments estimates reveal that the comparative immobility of low-skill workers is due not to higher mobility costs but to a lower incidence of adverse labor demand shocks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706048
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Head Start and the Distribution of Long-Term Education and Labor Market Outcomes,Monique De Haan and Edwin Leuven,"We investigate the effect of Head Start on education and wage income for individuals in their 30s in the NLSY79. We contribute to the existing literature by examining effects across outcome distributions, using an approach that relies on two weak stochastic dominance assumptions that can be checked using pre–Head Start cohorts. We find that Head Start has positive and statistically significant effects on years of education and wage income. We also uncover important heterogeneity in the program’s effectiveness; the effects are concentrated at the lower end of the distribution, and the effects are strongest for women, blacks, and Hispanics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706090
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,The Indirect Effects of Educational Expansions: Evidence from a Large Enrollment Increase in University Majors,Nicola Bianchi,"Increasing access to education may have consequences that go beyond effects on marginal students encouraged to enroll. It may change peer effects, school quality, and returns to skill. This paper studies how classmates and teaching inputs affect learning of university students, exploiting an educational expansion in Italian STEM majors. Newly collected data on 27,236 students indicate that less prepared classmates and congestion of teaching resources lowered learning of incumbent students in STEM fields. Their learning, however, increased in courses in which the new classmates raised average preparedness. These effects might have had long-lasting consequences on the returns to STEM degrees.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706050
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,High-Performing Peers and Female STEM Choices in School,Pierre Mouganie and Yaojing Wang,"The purpose of this paper is to examine how social environment affects women’s STEM choices as early as high school. Using administrative data from China, we find that exposure to high-performing female peers in mathematics increases the likelihood that women choose a science track during high school, while exposure to more high-performing males decrease this likelihood. We also find that peer quality has persistent effects on college outcomes. Overall, there is little evidence of peer effects for boys. Our results suggest that girls doing well in mathematics provide an affirmation effect that encourages female classmates to pursue a STEM track.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706052
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Do Educator Performance Incentives Help Students? Evidence from the Teacher Incentive Fund National Evaluation,"Cecilia Speroni, Alison Wellington, Paul Burkander, Hanley Chiang, Mariesa Herrmann and Kristin Hallgren","This paper presents findings from a national experimental evaluation of performance bonuses funded by the Teacher Incentive Fund grant program. The study finds no robust evidence of positive impacts of bonuses on student achievement, although some specifications suggest a small positive effect that compares favorably with other education interventions. When controlling for covariates, we find that offering bonuses of an average yearly cost of $100 per student had a small significant impact of about 0.04 standard deviations. However, these impacts are smaller (0.01 standard deviations) and become insignificant when not controlling for covariates or using an alternative method of inference.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706059
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,The Unintended Consequences of “Ban the Box”: Statistical Discrimination and Employment Outcomes When Criminal Histories Are Hidden,Jennifer Doleac and Benjamin Hansen,"Jurisdictions across the United States have adopted “ban the box” (BTB) policies preventing employers from asking about job applicants’ criminal records until late in the hiring process. Their goal is to improve employment outcomes for those with criminal records, with a secondary goal of reducing racial disparities in employment. However, removing criminal history information could increase statistical discrimination against demographic groups that include more ex-offenders. We use variation in the timing of BTB policies to test BTB’s effects on employment. We find that BTB policies decrease the probability of employment by 3.4 percentage points (5.1%) for young, low-skilled black men.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705880
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Public and Private Employer Learning: Evidence from the Adoption of Teacher Value Added,Michael Bates,"Informational asymmetries between employers may inhibit optimal worker mobility. However, researchers rarely observe shocks to employers’ information. I exploit two school districts’ adoptions of value-added (VA) measures of teacher effectiveness—informational shocks to some, but not all, employers—to provide direct tests of asymmetric employer learning. I develop a learning model and test its predictions for teacher mobility. I find that adopting VA increases within-district mobility of high-VA teachers, while low-VA teachers move out of district to uninformed principals. These patterns are consistent with asymmetric employer learning. This sorting from widespread VA adoption exacerbates inequality in access to effective teaching.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705881
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,High-Dosage Tutoring and Reading Achievement: Evidence from New York City,Roland G. Fryer and Meghan Howard-Noveck,"This study examines the impact on student achievement of high-dosage reading tutoring for middle school students in New York City public schools, using a school-level randomized field experiment. Across 3 years, schools offered at least 130 hours of four-on-one tutoring based on a guided reading model. At the mean, tutoring had a positive and significant effect on school attendance, a positive but insignificant effect on English language arts (ELA) state test scores, and no effect on math state test scores. For black students, our treatment increased attendance by 2.0 percentage points and ELA scores by 0.09 standard deviations per year.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705882
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,"Weak Markets, Strong Teachers: Recession at Career Start and Teacher Effectiveness","Markus Nagler, Marc Piopiunik and Martin R. West","How do alternative job opportunities affect teacher quality? We provide causal evidence on this question by exploiting business cycle conditions at career start as a source of exogenous variation in the outside options of potential teachers. Unlike prior research, we directly assess teacher quality with value-added measures of impacts on student test scores, using administrative data on over 30,000 Florida public school teachers. Consistent with a Roy model of occupational choice, teachers entering the profession during recessions are significantly more effective in raising student test scores. Results are supported by robustness tests and unlikely to be driven by differential attrition.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705883
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,A Pleasure That Hurts: The Ambiguous Effects of Elite Tutoring on Underprivileged High School Students,"Son Thierry Ly, Eric Maurin and Arnaud Riegert","This paper reports findings from a randomized evaluation of an intensive tutoring program conducted in underprivileged high schools. Within each school, the intervention targets students identified as having the ability to pursue a college education. The program is designed to strengthen their readiness for higher education. We demonstrate that such an intervention can have negative effects on a large fraction of participants, even though participation is entirely voluntary. This result is consistent with a simple model where time invested in extracurricular programs and time invested in homework represent imperfect substitutes in the education production function.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705925
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Opening the Black Box of the Matching Function: The Power of Words,Ioana Marinescu and Ronald Wolthoff,"On the leading job board CareerBuilder.com, high-wage job postings unexpectedly attract fewer applicants, and this is the case even within a detailed occupation. Viewed through the lens of our directed search model, this negative relationship is indicative of substantial applicant heterogeneity within an occupation. Empirically, we find that job title heterogeneity is key: within a job title, jobs with 10% higher wages do attract 7.7% more applicants. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a higher return to worker quality for hires in “manager” and “senior” job titles. Overall, our findings demonstrate the power of words in the matching process.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705903
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,"Does Parental Quality Matter? Evidence on the Transmission of Human Capital Using Variation in Parental Influence from Death, Divorce, and Family Size","Eric Gould, Avi Simhon and Bruce Weinberg","This paper examines the transmission of human capital from parents to children using variation in parental influence due to parental death, divorce, and the increasing specialization of parental roles in larger families. All three sources of variation yield strikingly similar patterns that show that the strong parent-child correlation in human capital is largely causal. In each case, the parent-child correlation in education is stronger with the parent who spends more time with the child and weaker with the parent who spends relatively less time parenting. These findings help us understand why educated parents spend more time with their children.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705904
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,The Effect of Child Support on Selection into Marriage and Fertility,Daniel Tannenbaum,"This paper studies the expansion of US child support policies from 1977 to 1992 and its consequences for marriage and fertility decisions. I develop a model showing that child support enforces ex ante commitment from men to provide financial support in the event of a child, which (1) increases premarital sex among couples unlikely to marry and (2) reduces the abortion rate by reducing the cost of child-rearing to single moms. Using variation in the rollout relative to the timing of nonmarital pregnancy, I find that child support policies reduced the likelihood of marriage and reduced the abortion rate.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705928
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Does Labor Supply Respond to Transitory Income? Evidence from the Economic Stimulus Payments of 2008,David Powell,"This paper studies labor supply responses to transitory income, exploiting the differential timing of the 2008 tax rebates. While an influential literature finds that rebates encourage consumer spending, it has ignored the ramifications on labor supply. I estimate that each rebate dollar reduces monthly earnings by 9 cents with smaller but significant lagged effects. This responsiveness is primarily concentrated in the second quartile of the earnings distribution and among hourly workers. The results imply that the $96 billion in stimulus payments had a partial equilibrium effect of reducing short-term national labor earnings by more than $26 billion.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704494
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,The Opportunity Costs of Mandatory Military Service: Evidence from a Draft Lottery,"Paul Bingley, Petter Lundborg and Stéphanie Vincent Lyk-Jensen","Conscription forces young men to serve in the military, irrespective of their opportunity costs. Using random assignment in the Danish draft lottery, we find a negative average effect of peacetime military service on earnings, an effect varying by ability, with high-ability men facing a $23,000 lifetime earnings penalty but with low-ability men facing none. This gradient is robust to different measures of labor market prospects. Educational disruption is an important mechanism, while service has little effect on health or criminal activity. The opportunity costs of conscription are borne by men with the best labor market prospects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704495
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Cyclical and Market Determinants of Involuntary Part-Time Employment,"Robert Valletta, Leila Bengali and Catherine van der List","The fraction of the US workforce identified as involuntary part-time workers rose to new highs during the US Great Recession and came down only slowly in its aftermath. We assess the determinants of involuntary part-time work using an empirical framework that accounts for business cycle effects and persistent structural features of the labor market. We conduct regression analyses using state-level panel data for the years 2003–16. The results indicate that structural factors, notably shifts in the industry composition of employment, have held the incidence of involuntary part-time work slightly more than 1 percentage point above its prerecession level.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704496
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Birth Order and Delinquency: Evidence from Denmark and Florida,"Sanni Breining, Joseph Doyle, David Figlio, Krzysztof Karbownik and Jeffrey Roth","Little is known about the role birth order plays in delinquency and adult crime outcomes that carry significant externalities. We use rich data sets from Denmark and Florida to examine these outcomes and explore potential mechanisms. Despite large environmental differences between the areas, we find remarkably consistent results: in families with two or more children, secondborn boys are 20%–40% more likely to be disciplined in school and enter the criminal justice system than are their firstborn male siblings. We rule out health at birth and school quality as mechanisms but find evidence for the role of parental time investment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704497
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Why Birthright Citizenship Matters for Immigrant Children: Short- and Long-Run Impacts on Educational Integration,"Christina Felfe, Helmut Rainer and Judith Saurer","This paper examines whether the introduction of birthright citizenship in Germany affected immigrant children’s educational outcomes at the first three stages of the education system: preschool, primary school, and secondary school. Using a birth date cutoff as a source of exogenous variation, we find that the policy (i) increased immigrant children’s participation in noncompulsory preschool education, (ii) had positive effects on key developmental outcomes measured at the end of the preschool period, (iii) caused immigrant children to progress faster through primary school, and (iv) increased the likelihood of them attending the academic track of secondary school.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704570
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Raising Aspirations and Higher Education: Evidence from the United Kingdom’s Widening Participation Policy,Lucia Rizzica,"This paper investigates the relationship between aspirations and inequality in higher education participation. Using a regression discontinuity design, I evaluate the impact of a national-scale United Kingdom policy aimed at raising the aspirations toward college education of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds by involving them in outreach activities. The results show that the policy successfully raised the aspirations of the target students and their participation in postcompulsory education. However, its final effect on college enrollment was on the whole negligible, thus casting doubt on the effectiveness of policies that uniquely leverage aspirations to reduce inequality in educational attainment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704571
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,Student Loans and Homeownership,"Alvaro Mezza, Daniel Ringo, Shane Sherlund and Kamila Sommer","We estimate the effect of student loan debt on subsequent homeownership in a uniquely constructed administrative data set for a nationally representative cohort. We instrument for the amount of individual student debt using changes to the in-state tuition rate at public 4-year colleges in the student’s home state. A $1,000 increase in student loan debt lowers the homeownership rate by about 1.8 percentage points for public 4-year college-goers during their mid-20s, equivalent to an average delay of about 4 months in attaining homeownership. Validity tests suggest the results are not confounded by local economic conditions or changes in educational outcomes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704609
Journal of Labor Economics,2020,"Parental Leave Benefits, Household Labor Supply, and Children’s Long-Run Outcomes","Rita Ginja, Jenny Jans and Arizo Karimi","We study how parental leave benefit levels affect household labor supply, family income, and child outcomes, exploiting the speed premium (SP) in the Swedish leave system. The SP grants mothers higher benefits for a subsequent child without reestablishing eligibility through market work if two births occur within a prespecified interval. We use the spacing eligibility cutoffs in a regression discontinuity framework and find that the SP improves educational outcomes of the older child but not those of the younger. Impacts are likely driven by increased maternal time and the quality of maternal time relative to the counterfactual mode of care.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704615
