The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Investors’ Attention to Corporate Governance,"Peter Iliev, Jonathan Kalodimos and Michelle Lowry","Using unique data on investor views of EDGAR company filings, we document that many investors engage in governance research. However, investors’ monitoring is disproportionately focused on large firms and firms with meetings outside the busy spring proxy season. Using an instrumental variables approach that isolates the drop in governance attention during the busy proxy season, we show that governance research is related to investors’ monitoring of firms, through voice and exit. Moreover, governance research disciplines management, who, as a result, reduce investments and increase payouts. The concentration of attention results in joint monitoring of a relatively small subset of firms.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab003
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,The Costs and Benefits of Shareholder Democracy: Gadflies and Low-Cost Activism,Nickolay Gantchev and Mariassunta Giannetti,"We show that there is cross-sectional variation in the quality of shareholder proposals. On average, proposals submitted by the most active individual sponsors are less likely to receive majority support, but they occasionally pass if shareholders mistakenly support them and may even be implemented due to directors’ career concerns. While gadfly proposals destroy shareholder value if they pass, shareholder proposals on average are value enhancing in firms with more informed shareholders. We conclude that more informed voting could increase the benefits associated with shareholder proposals.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa128

Data from Japanese firms indicate that firms initiating perk programs attract individual retail shareholders and experience increases in share values. We find support for three channels by which perks increase firm value: an increase in share liquidity, a decrease in the equity cost of capital, and signaling to investors. A fourth channel, by which perks help to market the firm’s products to consumers, receives mixed support. We do not find evidence that perk programs work to entrench managers.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa141
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,The Whack-a-Mole Game: Tobin Taxes and Trading Frenzy,"Jinghan Cai, Jibao He, Wenxi Jiang and Wei Xiong","To dampen trading frenzy in the stock market, the Chinese government tripled the stamp tax for stock trading on May 30, 2007. The greatly increased trading cost triggered a migration of the trading frenzy from the stock market to the warrant market, which was not subject to the stamp tax. This migration exacerbated a price bubble in the warrant market. Our analysis of investor account data uncovers not only large inflows of new investors to the warrant market but also greatly intensified trading by existing warrant investors. This episode exemplifies the so-called “whack-a-mole” game in financial regulations.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa135

Evidence from a Natural Experiment,"Dusan Isakov, Christophe Pérignon and Jean-Philippe Weisskopf","We study the effect of dividend taxes on the payout and investment policies of publicly listed firms. We exploit a unique setting in Switzerland where, following the corporate tax reform of 2011, some but not all firms were suddenly able to pay tax-exempt dividends. We show that treated firms increase their dividend payout by around 30 after the tax cut. The effect on payout is less pronounced for firms prone to agency conflicts. We find a significant positive abnormal stock return after the announcement of the payment of a tax-exempt dividend. However, reducing dividend taxes does not boost investment.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab010
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Debt Maturity and the Dynamics of Leverage,Thomas Dangl and Josef Zechner,"This paper shows that short debt maturities commit equityholders to leverage reductions when refinancing expiring debt in low-profitability states. However, shorter maturities lead to higher transaction costs since larger amounts of expiring debt need to be refinanced. We show that this trade-off between higher expected transaction costs against the commitment to reduce leverage in low-profitability states motivates an optimal maturity structure of corporate debt. Since firms with high costs of financial distress and risky cash flows benefit most from committing to leverage reductions, they have a stronger motive to issue short-term debt. Evidence supports the model’s predictions.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa148

Each asset’s liquidity thus depends on the impact of its sale on the value of the entire portfolio. We demonstrate the importance of cross-signaling and derive sufficient conditions for a liquidity “pecking order” that determines the order of sale. For assets backed by a common pool, liquidity naturally aligns with seniority. Finally, we extend the portfolio liquidation game to consider security design and demonstrate the optimality of pooling securities and selling senior tranches or debt secured by the pool, with retention increasing in asset quality or informational asymmetry.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa147

A bank’s loan default history is a noisy measure of its past monitoring choices, which can serve as a reputation mechanism to incentivize current monitoring. In equilibrium, higher reputation banks monitor (weakly) more intensively; if retention is credible, they generally retain less of the loans they originate. Monitoring is difficult to sustain in periods with uncommonly large spikes in loan demand (“booms”), especially for low-reputation banks, which are more likely to accommodate boom demand and forgo monitoring.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab012

By allowing a majority of creditors to modify payment obligations, such clauses reduce the likelihood of holdouts, while facilitating strategic default by the sovereign. We find that CAC bonds trade in the secondary market at lower yields than otherwise similar no-CAC bonds. The yield differential widens in countries with worse ratings and in those with stronger legal systems, especially if of midrange quality.

A new measure, the term structure of risk, captures the sensitivities of multiperiod expected returns to structural shocks. The level and slope of the term structure of risk can indicate misspecification in equilibrium models.

Investment-grade corporate bonds traded at a discount to credit default swaps; exchange-traded funds traded at a discount to net asset value, more so for safer bonds. The Federal Reserve’s announcement of corporate bond purchases caused these dislocations to disappear and prices to recover. These facts inform potential theories of the disruption.

As asset prices dip, risk-tolerant agents’ wealth share declines. This decline reduces the market’s risk tolerance and triggers a downward loop in asset prices and aggregate demand when the interest rate policy is constrained. In this context, large-scale asset purchases are effective because they transfer unwanted risk to the government’s balance sheet.

Prices rose more in locations with inelastic supply, higher prelaw house prices, higher income, and lower unemployment. These estimates reveal that richer households value the option to pledge their home as collateral more strongly.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa117
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,How Much Information Is Incorporated into Financial Asset Prices? Experimental Evidence,Lionel Page and Christoph Siemroth,"We investigate the informational content of prices in financial asset markets. To do so, we use a large number of market experiments in which the amount of information held by traders is precisely observed. We derive a new method to estimate how much of this information is incorporated into market prices. We find that public information is almost completely reflected in prices but that surprisingly little private information—less than 50%—is incorporated into prices. Our estimates therefore suggest that, while semistrong informational efficiency is consistent with the data, financial market prices may be very far from strong-form efficiency.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa143

The Review of Financial Studies,2021,CAPM-Based Company (Mis)valuations,"Olivier Dessaint, Jacques Olivier, Clemens A Otto and David Thesmar","There is a discrepancy between CAPM-implied and realized returns. Using the CAPM in capital budgeting—as recommended in textbooks—should thus have real effects. For instance, low beta projects should be valued more by CAPM users than by the market. We test this hypothesis using M&A data and show that bids for low-beta private targets entail lower bidder returns. We provide further support by testing several ancillary predictions. Our analyses suggest that using the CAPM when valuing targets leads to valuation errors (relative to the market’s view) corresponding on average to 12% to 33% of the deal values.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa049
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Models or Stars: The Role of Asset Pricing Models and Heuristics in Investor Risk Adjustment,Richard B Evans and Yang Sun,"We examine the role of factor models and simple performance heuristics in investor decision-making using Morningstar’s 2002 rating methodology change. Before the change, flows strongly correlated with CAPM alphas. After, when funds are ranked by size and book-to-market groups, flows become more sensitive to 3-factor alphas (FF3). Flows to a matched institutional sample (same managers/strategies) follow FF3 before and after the change but are unrelated to the CAPM. Placebo tests with sector funds and other factor loadings show no effects. Our results imply that improvements in simple performance heuristics can result in more sophisticated risk adjustment by retail investors.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa043
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,What Do Fund Flows Reveal about Asset Pricing Models and Investor Sophistication?,Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Chandra Sekhar Mangipudi,"Recent evidence indicates that market model alphas are stronger predictors of mutual fund flows than alphas with other models. Some recent papers have interpreted this evidence to mean that CAPM is the best asset pricing model, but some others have interpreted it as evidence against investor sophistication. We evaluate the merits of these mutually exclusive interpretations. We show that no tenable inference about the validity of any asset pricing model can be drawn from this evidence. Rejecting the investor sophistication hypothesis is tenable, but the appropriate benchmark to judge sophistication is different from that used in this literature.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa045
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Out-of-Sample Performance of Mutual Fund Predictors,Christopher S Jones and Haitao Mo,"We analyze the out-of-sample performance of variables shown to forecast future mutual fund alphas. The degree of predictability, as measured by alpha spreads from quintile sorts or cross-sectional regression slopes, falls by at least half post-sample. These declines appear to be primarily the result of changes in the level of arbitrage activity in the market, with mutual fund competition appearing to play a secondary role. We find no evidence that the declines are the result of data snooping or learning by investors or fund managers. Finally, we show that corporate bond fund performance exhibits similar dependence on measures of bond market arbitrage activity.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa026
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Portfolio Pumping and Managerial Structure,Saurin Patel and Sergei Sarkissian,"Using U.S. equity mutual fund data, we show that portfolio pumping—an illegal trading activity that artificially inflates year- and quarter-end portfolio returns—is more pronounced among single-managed funds compared with team-managed ones. The return inflation by team-managed funds is 45% lower than by single-managed funds at year-ends. Also, portfolio pumping decreases as team size increases. These results are driven by peer effects among teams and, sometimes, amplified by less convex flow-performance relation in team-managed funds. Our findings are robust to differences in fund governance, manager career concerns, local networks, fund family policies, and changes in the SEC’s enforcement policies.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa027
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Best Buys and Own Brands: Investment Platforms’ Recommendations of Mutual Funds,"Gordon Cookson, Tim Jenkinson, Howard Jones and Jose Vicente Martinez","Individuals increasingly buy mutual funds via online platforms, whose “best-buy” recommendations heavily influence flows. As intermediaries of mutual funds, platforms provide none of the unobservable interaction or intangible benefits of brokers, and so allow clean tests of the determinants, influence, and value of their fund recommendations. Using unique U.K. data, we find that platforms favor “own-brand” funds and those paying them a higher commission share. Investors discount own-brand recommendations, but not those paying high commission shares (which were not observable in the United Kingdom). A regulatory ban on commission sharing lowered costs and improved the informativeness of platform recommendations.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa057
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,The Chinese Warrants Bubble: Evidence from Brokerage Account Records,"Neil D Pearson, Zhishu Yang and Qi Zhang","We use brokerage account records to study trading during the Chinese put warrants bubble and find evidence consistent with extrapolative theories of speculative asset price bubbles. We identify the event that started the bubble and show that investors engaged in a form of feedback trading based on their own past returns. The interaction of feedback trading with the precipitating event caused additional buying and price increases in a feedback loop, and estimates of the trading volume due to this mechanism explain prices and returns during the bubble.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa037
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,"Winners, Losers, and Regulators in a Derivatives Market Bubble","Xindan Li, Avanidhar Subrahmanyam and Xuewei Yang","We use proprietary brokerage data to study trading patterns within a well-known financial market bubble: the Chinese warrants bubble. Persistently successful investors trade very actively and exhibit characteristics of de facto market makers. Unskilled investors unprofitably trend-chase and increase holdings in out-of-the-money warrants near expiration, whereas sophisticated investors do the reverse. We find that regulators did not properly forecast trading frenzies, as the prespecified price limits often exclude the fundamental values of warrants.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa058
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Momentum and Reversals When Overconfident Investors Underestimate Their Competition,"Jiang Luo, Avanidhar Subrahmanyam and Sheridan Titman","We develop a model in which overconfident investors overestimate their own signal quality but are skeptical of others’ Investors who are initially uninformed believe that early-informed investors have learned little, leading the former investors to provide excess liquidity, which, in turn, causes underreaction and short-run momentum. Skeptical investors can also react to stale information, causing momentum, followed by reversals. Hence, skepticism generates both momentum and reversals; the latter are amplified if investors overassess their own signal precision. We explain how long-run reversals can disappear while shorter-term momentum prevails, provide empirical implications, and link momentum to liquidity and price efficiency.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa016
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Implied Stochastic Volatility Models,"Yacine Ait-Sahalia, Chenxu Li and Chen Xu Li","This paper proposes “implied stochastic volatility models” designed to fit option-implied volatility data and implements a new estimation method for such models. The method is based on explicitly linking observed shape characteristics of the implied volatility surface to the coefficient functions that define the stochastic volatility model. The method can be applied to estimate a fully flexible nonparametric model, or to estimate by the generalized method of moments any arbitrary parametric stochastic volatility model, affine or not. Empirical evidence based on S&P 500 index options data show that the method is stable and performs well out of sample.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa041
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Untangling the Value Premium with Labor Shares,Andres Donangelo,"This paper quantifies the relative importance of labor-induced operating leverage at explaining the value premium. I extend a traditional variance decomposition methodology using labor shares to disentangle labor leverage from the value premium and from the value spread and from the variation in profitability levels and growth. My extended decomposition shows that labor leverage explains approximately 50% of the value premium, whereas profitability and growth-based mechanisms explain the other 50%. I propose a tractable production-based asset-pricing model that qualitatively and quantitatively explains this finding, as well as the relation between book-to-market ratios, discount rates, profitability, and future growth.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa022
The Review of Financial Studies,2021,Heterogeneous Taxes and Limited Risk Sharing: Evidence from Municipal Bonds,"Tania Babina, Chotibhak Jotikasthira, Christian Lundblad and Tarun Ramadorai","We evaluate the impacts of tax policy on asset returns using the U.S. municipal bond market. In theory, tax-induced ownership segmentation limits risk sharing, creating downward-sloping regions of the aggregate demand curve for the asset. In the data, cross-state variation in tax privilege policies predicts differences in in-state ownership of local municipal bonds; the policies create incentives for concentrated local ownership. High tax privilege states have muni bond yields that are more sensitive to variations in supply and local idiosyncratic risk. The effects are stronger when local investors face correlated background risk and/or diminishing marginal nonpecuniary benefits from holding local assets.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaa028
