Journal of Public Economics,2026,The impact of subjective school ratings on principal compensation and turnover,"Iftikhar Hussain, Vincenzo Scrutinio and Shqiponja Telhaj","Prior research has established that objective, test-score-based school accountability measures impact school leaders. Subjective evaluations, on the other hand, can provide a more nuanced assessment of school quality. This paper investigates the impact of subjective school inspection ratings on the salary and career outcomes of school principals. Ratings capture not just overall school quality, but also more granular aspects such as leadership quality, teaching and student achievement. Employing a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the overall school inspection rating has substantial impact on principals’ salaries and their rate of exit from public sector schooling. These effects are highly asymmetric: worse ratings have a substantially larger impact compared to rating improvements. Our findings suggest that competition is a key mechanism through which changes in school inspection ratings affect principals. Crucially, by leveraging detailed quality ratings, we show for the first time that the labor market can distinguish between signals concerning overall school quality and those specific to senior management quality.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002233
Journal of Public Economics,2026,Assessing the impact of grade retention: A cautionary tale of exclusion restriction violations,"Jordan S. Berne, Brian A. Jacob, Christina Weiland and Katharine O. Strunk","State laws that mandate in-grade retention for struggling readers are widespread in the U.S., and retention at the secondary school level is common in many countries. Researchers often use regression discontinuity (RD) methods to study such policies, leveraging strict performance cutoffs as an instrument to estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of retention on student achievement. In this paper, we document a likely threat to the internal validity of these studies. Examining two cohorts of Michigan students, we find that being flagged for retention increases reading performance by roughly 0.05 SD, a modest but meaningful impact. However, because being flagged increases the likelihood of actually being retained by only 3.4 percentage points, the implied effect of retention itself under standard assumptions would be an implausibly large 1.3 SD. Survey evidence suggests that flagged students receive more intensive reading support even if they are not retained, a violation of the exclusion restriction. Moreover, we estimate similar effects in districts that did not retain any students. These results raise concerns about potential bias in previously estimated retention effects and highlight the importance of carefully considering exclusion assumptions in analyses of multifaceted education interventions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002336
Journal of Public Economics,2026,The devil is in the details: Heterogeneous effects of the German minimum wage on working hours and minijobs,"Mario Bossler, Ying Liang and Thorsten Schank","Germany introduced a national minimum wage in 2015. While prior studies find limited effects on overall employment, we go into detail and examine its impact on working hours and minijobs. The minimum wage significantly reduces inequality in hourly and monthly wages. While average working hours remain stable, minijobbers experience notable cuts in working hours, which can be explained by the institutional context shaping the effects of the minimum wage. Employment in regular jobs remains unaffected, but minijobs decline, driven by transitions into both regular jobs and non-employment. The latter implies an employment elasticity of −0.16 for minijob employment. Following the first major minimum wage increase in 2022, we reveal a reduction in working hours that is not limited to minijobs, corresponding to an employment volume elasticity of −0.38.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002397
Journal of Public Economics,2026,Time preferences and food choice,"Andy Brownback, Alex Imas and Michael A. Kuhn","Food choices are canonical examples used to illustrate the importance of time preferences in behavioral economics. However, the literature lacks a direct demonstration that they are well-predicted by incentivized time preference measures. We offer direct evidence by combining a novel, two-question, incentivized time preference measurement with data from a field experiment that includes grocery purchases and consumption. Both our measures of standard discounting and non-stationary discounting are predictive of food choices, capturing a number of behaviors consistent with self-control problems.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002403
Journal of Public Economics,2026,"Protectionism, evasion and household welfare evidence from Nigeria’s import bans","Erhan Artuc, Guillermo Falcone, Guido Porto and Bob Rijkers","This paper analyzes the welfare impacts of import bans in Nigeria and how these impacts are shaped by evasion. Bans were not effectively enforced, thus fostering informal trade. The imposition of bans nonetheless increased consumer prices by 9.9 percent on average. However, price increases were substantially attenuated for goods for which trade policy is harder to enforce. Import bans disproportionately hurt richer households, who likewise disproportionately benefit from evasion.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002427
Journal of Public Economics,2026,Optimal income tax deductions for mixed business and personal expenditures,"Jacob Goldin, Sebastian Koehne and Nicholas Lawson","We study the optimal taxation of expenditures that generate income while also serving a consumption function. We characterize the Pareto optimal income tax deduction for such mixed-purpose expenditures within a generalized Atkinson–Stiglitz model. Pareto optimality requires a partial deduction for mixed-purpose expenditures, where the deduction rate depends on the fraction of an expenditure’s marginal benefits that are attributable to income-generation rather than consumption. We extend our results to account for several practical considerations, including potential constraints related to a uniform deduction rate or a fixed income tax schedule.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002439
Journal of Public Economics,2026,The consequences of wildfire liability for firm precaution: Evidence from power shutoffs in California,Christopher Malloy,"This paper examines firm responses to the entire distribution of potential liability by studying power line-ignited fires in California’s electric utility sector. In this setting, when a power line-ignited fire damages a structure, the owner of the power line assumes the cost. The unique setting allows me to estimate how firm precautions vary across the entire distribution of liabilities they face. Using exogenous variation in firms’ expected liabilities from potential fire ignitions across days, I show that, on average, firms are 0.03 percentage points more likely to take costly precautionary actions as the level of expected liability that they face increases by 10 % (mean of 0.6 %). Applying a back of the envelope calculation suggests that, at its mean distribution circuit, the most responsive firm increases precautionary investments by $10 per dollar increase in its expected liability. Furthermore, I show that firms’ precautionary responses weaken as the likelihood of bankruptcy from expected liability increases. Applying the estimates to a stylized model implies that limiting firms’ exposure to liability across their service territory would create aggregate social welfare benefits between $27 million and $270 million.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002518
Journal of Public Economics,2026,Estimating the welfare cost of labor supply frictions,"Katy Bergstrom, William Dodds, Nicholas Lacoste and Juan Rios","This paper quantifies how much people would be willing to pay to remove frictions that impede them from working their ideal number of hours using two sufficient statistics: (1) the percentage difference between ideal (i.e., frictionless) hours and actual hours, and (2) the Hicksian elasticity of ideal hours with respect to the after-tax wage rate. We implement this method to construct estimates of the willingness-to-pay to remove frictions in the United States and Germany. There are three core findings: (1) the cost of adjustment frictions (an omnibus measure encompassing, for example, fixed costs of adjustment, discrete choice sets, and search costs) is large for any reasonable value of the Hicksian ideal hours elasticity, even when accounting for multiple labor supply decisions, endogenous wages, and dynamic decisions; (2) the cumulative cost of adjustment frictions and tax misperceptions is even larger: individuals in the U.S. (Germany) would be willing to pay at least 7 % (4 %) of their income on average to remove these two frictions in hours worked; and (3) adjustment frictions appear to be much more costly than tax misperceptions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002555
Journal of Public Economics,2026,Social influence and carbon dioxide mitigation,Jayant Vivek Ganguli and Friederike Mengel,"We investigate the potential of social influence to increase people’s willingness to mitigate their carbon impact. In a large-scale online experiment consisting of two waves of data collection participants are given the choice to spend any share of a 10 GBP endowment on mitigation. If a wave-1 participant is told that their (anonymized) choice will be observed by a wave-2 participant before that participant makes their choice, then the wave-1 participant’s willingness to mitigate (WTM) increases by about 17%. This is not the case if their choice is observed by the wave-2 participant after that participant has already made their choice, which demonstrates that it is indeed the possibility of influence and not only observability that matters. Increasing influence at the extensive margin, i.e. increasing the number of wave-2 participants observing the choice, does not increase WTM. We also elicit beliefs and find that most participants overestimate how much influence they have.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002579
Journal of Public Economics,2026,A tale of gold and blood: The consequences of market deregulation on local violence,Leila Pereira and Rafael Pucci,"We investigate how deregulating and disabling a decentralized structure for monitoring gold transactions in Brazil ultimately led to an increase in violence related to illegal gold mining. We use a Difference-in-Differences design and a unique database that combines the location of gold deposits and protected areas, where mining is forbidden. We demonstrate that municipalities more exposed to illegal gold mining experienced almost ten additional homicides per 100,000 people - roughly 30 % more - after the deregulation. We also find suggestive evidence of more gold-mining land use inside protected areas in exposed municipalities, which serves as an indicator of illegal mining.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002580
Journal of Public Economics,2026,The long run effects of a teacher-focused school reform on student outcomes,"Sarah R. Cohodes, Ozkan Eren and Orgul Ozturk","This paper examines the effects of a teacher-focused school reform program — combining performance pay with teacher observation and feedback — implemented in high-need schools on students’ longer-run educational, criminal justice, and economic self-sufficiency outcomes. Using linked administrative data from a Southern state, we leverage the quasi-randomness of the timing of program adoption across schools to show that the school reform improved educational attainment and reduced both felony criminal activity before age 19 and dependence on government assistance in early adulthood (ages 18–22). We find little scope for student sorting or changes in the composition of teacher workforce to explain the findings, and instead find changes in school climate consistent with improved school environments and increased teacher efficiency. Program benefits far exceeded its costs. A comparison with a similar educator-focused reform suggests that the individual incentive component of the program is necessary but not sufficient to improve student outcomes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725002609
