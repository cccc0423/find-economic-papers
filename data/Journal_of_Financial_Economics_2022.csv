Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Measuring the welfare cost of asymmetric information in consumer credit markets,"Anthony DeFusco, Huan Tang and Constantine Yannelis","Information asymmetries are known in theory to lead to inefficiently low credit provision, yet empirical estimates of the resulting welfare losses are scarce. This paper leverages a randomized experiment conducted by a large fintech lender to estimate welfare losses arising from asymmetric information in the market for online consumer credit. Building on methods from the insurance literature, we show how exogenous variation in interest rates can be used to estimate borrower demand and lender cost curves and recover implied welfare losses. While asymmetric information generates large equilibrium price distortions, we find only small overall welfare losses, particularly for high-credit-score borrowers.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001866
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Monetary policy expectation errors,"Maik Schmeling, Andreas Schrimpf and Sigurd A.M. Steffensen","How are financial markets pricing the monetary policy outlook? We use surveys to decompose excess returns on money market instruments into expectation errors and term premia. Excess returns are primarily driven by expectation errors, whereas term premia are negligible. Investors face challenges when learning about the Federal Reserve’s response to large, but infrequent, negative shocks in real-time. Rather than reflecting risk compensation, excess returns stem from investors underestimating how much the central bank eases policy in response to such rare shocks. We show, for the US and internationally, that expectation errors imply excess return predictability from past stock returns.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001908
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Liquidity in the global currency market,Angelo Ranaldo and Paolo Santucci de Magistris,"We study the liquidity of the global currency market by analyzing the price impact of trading volume. We analyze a decade of CLS intraday data representative of global foreign exchange (FX) trading by developing a refinement of the popular Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure that we call realized Amihud, which is the ratio between realized volatility and trading volume. Inversely related to market depth, price impact increases with transaction costs, money market stress, uncertainty, and risk aversion. Furthermore, we analyze whether and how liquidity begets price efficiency by looking at violations of the “triangular” no-arbitrage condition. We find that dollar-based currencies offer a lower trading impact supporting price efficiency.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001891
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Capital forbearance in the bank recovery and resolution game,"Natalya Martynova, Enrico Perotti and Javier Suarez","We analyze the strategic interaction between undercapitalized banks and a supervisor in a recovery and resolution framework in which early recapitalizations can prevent later disorderly failures. Capital forbearance emerges because reputational, political, economic and fiscal costs undermine supervisors’ commitment to publicly resolve the banks that miss the request to privately recover. Under a weaker resolution threat, banks’ incentives to recover are lower and supervisors may end up having to resolve more banks. When marginal resolution costs steeply increase with the scale of the intervention, private recovery actions become strategic complements, producing too-many-to-resolve equilibria with high forbearance and high systemic costs.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2200191X
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Shale shocked: Cash windfalls and household debt repayment,"J. Anthony Cookson, Erik P. Gilje and Rawley Z. Heimer","Using individual credit bureau data matched with cash windfalls from fracking, we estimate that windfall recipients reduce debt-to-income by 2.4 percentage points relative to no-windfall controls. Debt repayment effects are 3 times stronger for subprime individuals than for prime individuals. Based on the timing of upfront versus continuing cash payments, debt repayment coincides with the timing of payments but not with news about future payments. These findings present a challenge for purely forward-looking models of debt. Indeed, when we incorporate a windfall shock into a forward-looking model, the model predicts an increase in debt that runs counter to our evidence of debt repayment.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22002069

In the model, firms trade off higher profitability of newer products versus product introduction costs. Using product-level data, we find that the product dimension is critical in quantitatively explaining cash flow dynamics, corporate policies, and industry structure. We show that product introductions and capital investment are complements and that product dynamics incentivize preserving more debt capacity. Our estimates reveal that product life cycle is more pronounced for firms with smaller and more concentrated product portfolios as well as those with high product variety.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2200188X
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,The life of the counterparty: Shock propagation in hedge fund-prime broker credit networks,"Mathias S. Kruttli, Phillip J. Monin and Sumudu Watugala","Using novel credit data, we show that hedge fund borrowing is significantly overcollateralized, primarily with rehypothecable securities. An idiosyncratic liquidity shock to a major prime broker significantly decreases credit to connected hedge funds. The dominant channel behind this shock transmission is credit supply reduction rather than precautionary demand reduction. Funds posting more rehypothecable collateral are less affected because their collateral alleviates prime broker liquidity constraints. Exposed funds subsequently have lower aggregate credit with worse terms, suggesting imperfect substitutability across hedge fund credit sources. Funds subject to the decrease in balance sheet leverage subsequently increase portfolio illiquidity, embedded leverage, and derivatives exposure.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2200054X
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Partisan residential sorting on climate change risk,"Asaf Bernstein, Stephen B. Billings, Matthew T.

Comparing individual properties in the same zip code with similar elevation and proximity to the coast, houses exposed to sea level rise (SLR) are increasingly more likely to be owned by Republicans and less likely to be owned by Democrats. We find a partisan residency gap for even moderately SLR exposed properties of more than 5 percentage points, which has more than doubled over the past six years. Findings are unchanged controlling flexibly for other individual demographics and a variety of granular property characteristics, including the value of the home. Residential sorting manifests among owners regardless of occupancy, but not among renters, and is driven by long-run SLR exposure but not current flood risk. Anticipatory sorting on climate change suggests that households that are most likely to vote against climate friendly policies and least likely to adapt may ultimately bear the burden of climate change.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22000757
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,What moves treasury yields?,Emanuel Moench and Soroosh Soofi-Siavash,"We identify a yield news shock as an innovation that does not move Treasury yields contemporaneously but explains a maximum share of their future variation. Yields do not immediately respond to the news shock as the initial reaction of term premiums and expected short rates offset each other. While the impact on term premiums fades quickly, expected short rates and thus yields decline persistently. As a result, the shock explains a staggering 50% of Treasury yield variation several years out. A positive yield news shock is associated with a coincident sharp increase in stock and bond market volatility, a contemporaneous response of leading economic indicators, and is followed by a persistent decline of real activity and inflation which is accommodated by the Federal Reserve. Identified shocks to realized stock market volatility and business cycle news imply similar impulse responses and together capture the bulk of variation of the yield news shock.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22000770

In our sequential trading model, there are price-elastic noise and informed traders. We estimate the model through maximum likelihood for a sample of 60 NYSE stocks in 2017.

Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Voting and trading: The shareholder’s dilemma,Adam Meirowitz and Shaoting Pi,"We study governance when shareholders vote and can also buy or sell shares. We find that voting for the policy that one believes is better for the firm maximizes portfolio value only when pivotal; otherwise, it is better to vote against one’s information, distort the market, and then trade at the distorted price. Equilibrium voting informativeness balances these forces and is demonstrably low. As the number of shareholders grows, the probability of making the correct decision becomes lower than the informational quality of just one shareholder’s private signal. Despite this, shareholders extract information rents from trading and thus obtain additional value from their private information. These effects are related to the level of direct information leakage in the market. The predicted patterns of trading and market volatility help reconcile several debates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22000952

I show that fanatic and rational views dominate over time, and their relative importance depends on their following by influencers.

Constrained CLOs are forced to sell loans downgraded to CCC or below, and thus loans widely held by constrained CLOs experience temporary price depreciation. This instability is exacerbated by diversification requirements. As the CLO market grows, each CLO’s effort to diversify its portfolio leads to similarity in loan holdings among CLOs, and thus their leverage constraints simultaneously bind. CLOs’ overlapping loan holdings spread idiosyncratic shocks to large borrowers to the overall leveraged loan market.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22000976

Accordingly, we show that a one-standard-deviation increase in aggregate uncertainty amplifies the predictive ability of sentiment for market returns by two to four times relative to when uncertainty is at its mean. For the cross-section of returns, the predictive ability of sentiment for assets expected to be most sensitive to sentiment, including existing measures of both risk and mispricing, is substantially larger in times of higher uncertainty. The results hold for both daily and monthly proxies for sentiment and for various proxies for uncertainty.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2200112X

We build a dynamic credit risk model to understand the negative covariance between equity betas and the market risk premium, via endogenous and dynamic debt financing over the business cycles. Because of endogenous debt financing and distress, our model naturally connects the negative failure probability-return relation to the positive distress risk premium-return relation.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21004402

We formally characterize equilibria when the firm is not required to repurchase outstanding debt prior to issuing additional debt. For realistic values of issuance costs and debt maturity, the no-commitment policy generates tax benefits that are similar to those obtained by a benchmark policy with commitment. For positive but arbitrarily small issuance costs, there are maturities for which shareholders extract essentially the entire claim to cash-flows.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001519
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Dissecting green returns,"Lubos Pastor, Robert Stambaugh and Lucian A. Taylor","Green assets delivered high returns in recent years. This performance reflects unexpectedly strong increases in environmental concerns, not high expected returns. German green bonds outperformed their higher-yielding non-green twins as the “greenium” widened, and U.S. green stocks outperformed brown as climate concerns strengthened. Despite that outperformance, we estimate lower expected returns for green stocks than for brown, consistent with theory. We estimate expected returns in two ways: ex ante, using implied costs of capital, and ex post, using realized returns purged of shocks from climate concerns and earnings. A theoretically motivated green factor explains much of value stocks’ recent underperformance.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001672
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Size-adapted bond liquidity measures and their asset pricing implications,Michael Reichenbacher and Philipp Schuster,"We develop new liquidity measures for bond markets. Existing measures suffer from the combination of two effects. First, transaction costs in OTC markets strongly depend on trade size. Second, many bonds trade only scarcely with strongly differing trading volumes. Therefore, changes in average transaction costs often indicate changing trade sizes rather than changing liquidity. We combine full-sample information for the size-cost relation with individual transaction data to eliminate such measurement problems. We find that size-adapted measures make a difference when analyzing liquidity dynamics in the U.S. corporate bond market, liquidity differences between bonds, and the asset pricing implications of liquidity.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001702

We show that bond underwriters respond by selectively “overallocating” some issues to attain net short positions. Overallocations are economically substantive, facilitate the syndicate's price stabilization efforts, and are largely offset in the days after issuance. These issues on average experience more net selling by institutional investors and, despite large syndicate purchases, appreciate less in the secondary market. Thus, overallocation is an observable indicator that underwriters anticipate weakness in net secondary market demand.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001714

Yet, whether depositors – banks’ most important claimholders – are affected by transparency, is an empirical open question. Analyzing US commercial banks from 1994 to 2019, we show that uninsured deposit flows are more sensitive to information about bank performance when banks are more transparent. We also link transparency to deposit rates, banks’ investment funding patterns, and profitability. In addition, we find consistent evidence from a differences-in-difference analysis using the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as a shock to transparency. Overall, our findings demonstrate that transparency is important in shaping depositors’ behavior and highlight its potential costs.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001696

We contrast outages at Robinhood, which caters to inexperienced investors, with outages at traditional retail brokers. For stocks with high retail interest, we find that negative shocks to Robinhood investor participation are associated with reduced market order imbalances, increased market liquidity, and lower return volatility, whereas the opposite relations hold following outages at traditional retail brokerages. The findings suggest that herding by inexperienced investors can create inventory risks that harm liquidity in stocks with high retail interest, while other retail trading improves market quality.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001726

We demonstrate that the common practice of estimating linear regressions of the log of 1 plus the outcome produces estimates with no natural interpretation that can have the wrong sign in expectation.

Initial results suggest a negative relationship between the ST measure and future returns. The underperformance of low ST stocks is the strongest in countries with high idiosyncratic risk. However, the salience effect has three vital limitations. First, a substantial part of the anomaly can be attributed to the short-term return reversal. Second, it is priced primarily among microcaps. Third, the premium is realized predominantly following severe down markets and volatility spikes.

By shifting down and flattening the yield curve, NIRP differs from rate cuts just above the zero-lower-bound and has effects similar to QE. For identification, we exploit ECB’s NIRP and the Italian credit register and, for external validity, European and U.S. datasets. NIRP affects more banks with higher ex-ante liquid assets, including net interbank positions. More exposed banks reduce liquid assets, expand credit supply, especially to financially-constrained firms, and cut loan rates, inducing firms to increase investment and the wage bill.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21004931

Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Let the rich be flooded: The distribution of financial aid and distress after hurricane harvey,"Stephen B. Billings, Emily A. Gallagher and Lowell Ricketts","Outside of flood hazard zones, households must decide whether to insure or rely on disaster assistance to manage flood risk. We use the quasi-random flooding generated by Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in August 2017, to understand the implications of flood losses for households with differing access to insurance and credit. Outside the floodplain, credit-constrained homeowners experience a 20% increase in bankruptcies and a 13% increase in the share of debt in severe delinquency in flooded blocks relative to non-flooded areas. Treatment effects are universally insignificant inside the floodplain, implying that flood insurance mitigates the financial impact of flooding across the credit distribution. Disaster assistance, on the other hand, does not appear to counteract the role of initial inequalities on post-disaster credit outcomes. We find SBA disaster loans and, more surprisingly, FEMA grants to both be regressive in allocation. Our results highlight that averages mask important heterogeneity after disasters, which challenges existing narratives of how effectively Federal disaster programs mitigate the financial burden of natural disasters.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21005067

I merge student loan borrowing and repayment data from the College Scorecard with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System on counts of high school graduates enrolling in college from different states. I estimate the causal effect of personal finance education mandates by relating the change in the share of university students subject to a state mandate to changes in university cohort student loan outcomes. I find only students with higher-income parents respond by adjusting borrowing, reducing median balances by 7%. By contrast, first-generation and low-income borrowers bound by mandates did not significantly adjust borrowing, but were nonetheless more likely to pay down balances. Repayment improvements are in part due to better understanding of the terms governing federal student loans. State mandates that incorporate career research alongside personal finance education are associated with better student loan repayment than those focused only on personal finance education.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001453

A positive pre-FOMC GDP growth revision predicts a contractionary policy news shock (positive change in bond yields), a negative GDP growth revision predicts an expansionary policy news shock (negative change in bond yields). Failing to account for this predictability biases the estimates of monetary policy effects on the economy.

We newly integrate a work-horse New Keynesian model with countercyclical risk aversion via habit formation preferences. In the model, a surprise increase in the policy rate lowers consumption relative to habit, raising risk aversion.

Cities with larger speculative booms have larger price booms, sharper increases in unsold listings as the market turns, and more severe busts. We present a model in which predictable price increases endogenously attract short-term buyers more than long-term buyers. Short-term buyers amplify volume by selling faster and destabilize prices through positive feedback. Our model matches key aggregate patterns, including the lead–lag price–volume relation and a sharp rise in inventories.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001477

We find strong evidence that product market space is amongst the most important factors in peer selection, but Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, particularly three and four digit codes, do a poor job of categorizing related firms in this setting. Banks strategically select large, high growth peers with high valuation multiples, factors that are also positively related to premiums.

Robertson","We survey 2484 U.S. individuals with at least $1 million of investable assets about how well leading academic theories describe their financial beliefs and personal investment decisions. The wealthy's beliefs about financial markets and the economy are surprisingly similar to those of the average U.S. household, but the wealthy are less driven by discomfort with the market, financial constraints, and labor income considerations. Portfolio equity share is most affected by professional advice, time until retirement, personal experiences, rare disaster risk, and health risk. Concentrated equity holding is most often motivated by belief that the stock has superior risk-adjusted returns. Beliefs about how expected returns vary with stock characteristics frequently differ from historical relationships, and more risk is not always associated with higher expected returns. Active equity fund investment is most motivated by professional advice and the expectation of higher average returns. Berk and Green (2004) rationalize return chasing in the absence of fund performance persistence by positing that past returns reveal managerial skill but there are diminishing returns to scale in active management.

These findings are consistent with an equilibrium in which investors choose to gather private information whenever it is profitable.

We use loan-level microdata for all PPP loans and high-frequency administrative employment data to present three main findings. First, banks played an important role in mediating program targeting, which helps explain why some funds initially flowed to regions that were less adversely affected by the pandemic. Second, we exploit regional heterogeneity in lending relationships and individual firm-loan matched data to study the role of banks in explaining the employment effects of the PPP. We find the short- and medium-term employment effects of the program were small compared to the program’s size. Third, many firms used the loans to make non-payroll fixed payments and build up savings buffers, which can account for small employment effects and likely reflects precautionary motives in the face of heightened uncertainty. Limited targeting in terms of who was eligible likely also led to many inframarginal firms receiving funds and to a low correlation between regional PPP funding and shock severity. Our findings illustrate how business liquidity support programs affect firm behavior and local economic activity, and how policy transmission depends on the agents delegated to deploy it.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001131

Our results suggest that lenders trade off access to new markets against heightened competition for their own borrowers. Lenders that initially do not adopt lose borrowers to competitors that do, which ultimately compels them to adopt and leads to the formation of an information sharing system.

Journal of Financial Economics,2022,The rise of a network: Spillover of political patronage and cronyism to the private sector,Terry Moon and David Schoenherr,"We document that networks that gain access to political power and use it for patronage appointments also gain control over resource allocation in the private sector. Specifically, following a presidential election in Korea, the president appoints members of his network into important positions in government, and private banks respond by appointing executives from the same network to establish links to the administration. Consequently, firms linked to the network obtain more credit at a lower rate from government and private banks alike, despite higher default rates. Micro-level data on loans and variation in network links for the same firm across lenders over time sharpen the interpretation of our results. In a parsimonious model, we show that efficiency costs are higher when government and private banks are controlled by the same group rather than different groups: in-group firms invest in more unprofitable projects, whereas out-group firms lack funding for highly profitable investments.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21004025

A principal driver of this phenomenon is the high illiquidity of funds’ holdings, which makes accurate pricing difficult and provides funds with greater discretion over valuation. Consequently, net asset values (NAVs) are extremely stale and fund returns are predictable over several days and weeks, particularly during market crises. Opportunistic traders withdraw capital from overvalued funds, exacerbating the risk of fund runs, while buy-and-hold investors face annual dilution of around $1.2 billion.

Longholder, the option-based measure of CEO overconfidence introduced by Malmendier and Tate (2005a) and widely used in the behavioral corporate finance and economics literatures, is significantly related to several specific characteristics that are associated with overconfident individuals as well as individuals with lower ability. Similar relations hold for overconfidence measures based on CEOs’ earnings guidance. Investment-cash flow sensitivities are larger for both Longholder and less able CEOs. After controlling for ability and other characteristics, Longholder CEOs’ investments remain significantly more sensitive to cash flows. These results suggest that overconfidence, as measured by Longholder, is correlated with lower ability but still reflects empirically distinct aspects of overconfidence.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21004293

In this paper, we propose that impression management considerations can also end up guiding the content that investors transmit via word of mouth and inadvertently lead to the propagation of noise. We analyze server log data from one of the largest investment-related websites in the United States. Consistent with our proposition, we find that investors more frequently share articles that are more suitable for impression management despite such articles less accurately predicting returns. Additional analyses suggest that high levels of sharing can lead to overpricing.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21003810

Specifically, we study the effects of local newspaper closures on violations by local facilities of publicly listed firms. After a local newspaper closure, local facilities increase violations by 1.1% and penalties by 15.2%, indicating that the closures reduce firm monitoring by the press. This effect is not driven by the underlying economic conditions, the underlying local fraud environment, or the underlying firm conditions.

But over subsequent decades, an unprecedented expansion saw market cap to GDP ratios triple and remain persistently high. While most historical stock market growth was driven by issuances, this recent expansion was fueled by rising equity prices.

The underreactions imply substantial out-of-sample return predictability, and investors appear to be leaving too much money on the table.

Employing the standard deviation of ESG ratings from six major providers as a proxy for ESG uncertainty, we provide supporting evidence for the model predictions.

Real factors (profitability, uncertainty, and taxes) account for only a fraction of the substantial drop in investment observed in the data. The reduction in credit supply has significant real effects, explaining 11–32% of the investment slump.

We find that firms provide at best partial insurance to their workers. Increased firm-level uncertainty reduces total compensation, especially variable pay, and workers reduce their durable goods consumption in response. Such shocks also lead to greater financial fragility among lower-income earners.

Journal of Financial Economics,2022,How monetary policy shaped the housing boom,"Itamar Drechsler, Alexi Savov and Philipp Schnabl","Between 2003 and 2006, the Federal Reserve raised rates by 4.25%. Yet it was precisely during this period that the housing boom accelerated, fueled by rapid growth in mortgage lending. There is deep disagreement about how, or even if, monetary policy impacted the boom. Using differences in exposure to the deposits channel of monetary policy, we show that Fed tightening induced a large reduction in banks’ deposit funding, which led banks to contract portfolio mortgage lending by 32%. However, this contraction was largely offset by substitution to privately-securitized (PLS) mortgages, led by nonbank originators. Fed tightening thus induced a shift in mortgage lending away from stable, insured deposit funding toward run-prone and fragile capital markets funding with little impact on overall lending. We find similar results during the most recent tightening cycle over 2014–2017 when PLS lending reemerged.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21003093
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Asset pricing on earnings announcement days,Kam Fong Chan and Terry Marsh,"Market betas have a strong and positive relation with average stock returns on a handful of days every year. Such unique days, defined as leading earnings announcement days (LEADs), are times when an aggregate of influential S&P 500 firms disclose quarterly earnings news early in the earnings season. The positive return-to-beta relation holds for various test portfolios, individual stocks, and Treasuries; and is robust to different data frequencies and testing procedures. On days other than LEADs, the beta-return relation is flat.

Hinzen, Kose John and Fahad Saleh","We demonstrate theoretically that Bitcoin’s limited adoption arises as an equilibrium outcome rather than as a short-lived property. Our results are driven by negative network effects which arise due to Bitcoin’s need for consensus and the existence of network delay. As the Bitcoin network expands, network delay grows thereby prolonging the time needed for generating consensus. In turn, transaction settlement becomes prolonged, and users abandon the system, yielding limited adoption. Increasing transaction rates fails to solve this problem because increasing transaction rates increases fork probabilities which prolongs the consensus process and generates limited adoption.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22000198

A comprehensive contract-level database allows us to observe the value, location, and end-use of firms’ real estate holdings in the US and all debts raised against those assets over the 2000–2017 period. Firms raise new debt following an increase in the value of their real estate but use unsecured rather than secured borrowing. We rationalize these findings with a model where firms’ choices between secured and unsecured debt reflect the systematic risk exposures of the assets on their balance sheets. While secured debt may be seen as a safer claim than unsecured debt contractually, we demonstrate that it can be riskier from an economic perspective.

Also, the deals harm dependent customer and supplier firms and they are more likely to be challenged by antitrust authorities.

Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Student debt and default: The role of for-profit colleges,"Luis Armona, Rajashri Chakrabarti and Michael Lovenheim","For-profit providers have become an important fixture of US higher education markets. Students who attend for-profit institutions take on more educational debt and are more likely to default on their student loans than those attending similarly-selective public schools. Because for-profits tend to serve students from more disadvantaged backgrounds, it is important to isolate the causal effect of for-profit enrollment on student debt and repayment outcomes as well as the educational and labor market mechanisms that drive any such effects. We approach this problem using a novel instrument combined with comprehensive institution-level data on student debt, default, educational attainment, and labor market outcomes. Our instrument leverages the interaction between changes in the demand for college due to labor demand shocks and the baseline supply of for-profit schools. We compare how enrollment and subsequent outcomes change across areas that experience similar labor demand shocks but that have different latent supply of for-profit institutions. The first-stage estimates show that students are much more likely to enroll in a for-profit institution for a given labor demand change when there is a higher supply of such schools in the base period. Among four-year students, for-profit enrollment leads to more loans, higher loan amounts, an increased likelihood of borrowing, and an increased risk of default. Two-year for-profit students also take out more loans, originate more student debt, and have higher default rates. We present evidence that these debt and default outcomes are driven by higher for-profit tuition and a negative effect of for-profit enrollment on labor market outcomes. Our results point to high costs and low returns to for-profit enrollment that generate worse student debt and repayment outcomes. These findings have important implications for public investments in higher education as well as for how students make postsecondary choices.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21005250

The equilibrium is subject to underinvestment and excessive aggregate risk-taking. Inefficiencies stem from an idiosyncratic risk externality, as firms do not internalize the effect of their investment decisions on the risk borne by others. Risk externalities depend on an idiosyncratic risk premium and a variance risk premium. We assess their magnitude empirically.

Using a new survey of US managers I establish three facts. (1) Managers are not overoptimistic: sales growth forecasts on average do not exceed realizations. (2) Managers are overprecise: they underestimate future sales growth volatility. (3) Managers overextrapolate: their forecasts are too optimistic after positive shocks and too pessimistic after negative shocks. To quantify the implications, I estimate a dynamic general equilibrium model in which managers of heterogeneous firms use a subjective beliefs process to make forward-looking hiring decisions. Overprecision and overextrapolation lead managers to overreact to firm-level shocks and overspend on adjustment costs, destroying 2.1% to 6.8% of the typical firm’s value. Pervasive overreaction leads to excess volatility and reallocation, lowering consumer welfare by 0.5% to 2.3% relative to the rational-expectations equilibrium.

An analyst is also more likely to issue “bold” forecasts when peers recently issued similar forecasts for other portfolio firms. Analysts learn more from peers with similar personal characteristics. Overall, social learning benefits analysts and improves their forecast accuracy.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002774
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Does customer-base structure influence managerial risk-taking incentives?,"Jie Chen, Xunhua Su, Xuan Tian and Bin Xu","We find strong evidence that when a firm's customer base is more concentrated, the firm's CEO receives more risk-taking incentives in her compensation package. This finding is robust to numerous alternative measures, alternative specifications, alternative subsamples, and different attempts that mitigate endogeneity concerns. Further, the positive effect of customer concentration on CEO risk-taking incentive provision is more prominent when the CEO is more reluctant to take risks, when the firm has more investment opportunities, and when the firm is more prone to the costs of losing large customers. These findings are consistent with the notion that boards provide additional risk-taking incentives to offset the CEO's aversion to the risk of non-diversified revenue streams, thereby preventing excessive managerial conservatism at the expense of value maximization.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21003433
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Equity tail risk and currency risk premiums,"Zhenzhen Fan, Juan M. Londono and Xiao Xiao","We find that an option-based equity tail risk factor is priced in the cross section of currency returns; more exposed currencies offer a low risk premium because they hedge against equity tail risk. A portfolio that buys currencies with high equity tail beta and shorts those with low beta extracts the global component in the tail factor. The estimated price of risk of this novel global factor is consistently negative in currency carry and momentum portfolios, and in portfolios of other asset classes, suggesting that excess returns of these strategies can be partially understood as compensations for global tail risk.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002026
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Peak-Bust rental spreads,Marco Giacoletti and Christopher A. Parsons,"Landlords appear to use stale information when setting rents. Among over 43,000 California rental houses in 2018–2019, those last purchased during 2005–2007 (the peak) rent for 2–3% more than those purchased during 2008–2010 (bust). Neither house nor landlord characteristics explain this “peak-bust rental spread.” To clarify the mechanism, we test cross-sectional predictions from a simple theory of rent-setting. We find empirical support for both reference dependence and distorted beliefs. In the first, monthly payments establish (recurring) reference points, against which gains or losses are measured. In the second, past sales prices distort landlords’ current estimates of house values/rents.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002555
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,"Learning, slowly unfolding disasters, and asset prices","Mohammad Ghaderi, Mete Kilic and Sang Byung Seo","We develop a model that generates slowly unfolding disasters not only in the macroeconomy but also in financial markets. In our model, investors cannot exactly distinguish whether the economy is experiencing a mild/temporary downturn or is on the verge of a severe/prolonged disaster. Due to imperfect information, disaster periods are not fully identified by investors ex ante. Bayesian learning induces equity prices to gradually react to persistent consumption declines, which plays a critical role in explaining the VIX, variance risk premium, and put-protected portfolio returns. We show that our model can rationalize the market patterns of recent major crises, such as the dot-com bubble burst, Great Recession, and COVID-19 crisis, through investors' belief channel.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002233
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Financial development and labor market outcomes: Evidence from Brazil,Julia Fonseca and Bernardus Van Doornik,"We estimate the effect of increased access to bank credit on the employment and wages of high- and low-skilled workers. To do so, we consider a bankruptcy reform that led to an expansion of bank credit to Brazilian firms. We use administrative data and exploit cross-sectional variation in the enforcement of the new legislation arising from differences in the congestion of civil courts. We find that the credit expansion led to an increase in the skill intensity of firms and in within-firm returns to skill and to a reallocation of skilled labor from financially unconstrained firms to constrained firms. To rationalize these findings, we design a model in which heterogeneous producers face constraints in their ability to borrow and have production functions featuring capital-skill complementarity. We use this framework to generate an industry-level measure of capital-skill complementarity, which we use to provide direct evidence that the effect of access to credit on skill utilization and the skill premium is driven by a relative complementarity between capital and skilled labor.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002750
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Price transparency in OTC equity lending markets: Evidence from a loan fee benchmark,"Fábio Cereda, Fernando Chague, Rodrigo De-Losso, Alan Genaro and Bruno Giovannetti","We study the effects of a price transparency shock in the Brazilian equity lending market, an over-the-counter market. Previously, the available loan fee benchmark was the mean loan fee of the past 15 trading days. On March 1, 2011, this interval was reduced to three days, significantly improving short-sellers’ ability to predict current loan fees. We find that after the benchmark change, loan fees fell, lending volume increased, total lending revenue remained stable, high-cost lenders lost market share, and price efficiency increased. Our results suggest implementing price benchmarks in OTC markets can improve market quality.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002269
Journal of Financial Economics,2022,Trade credit and profitability in production networks,Michael Gofman and Youchang Wu,"We construct a sample of over 200,000 supply chains between 2003 and 2018 to conduct a chain-based analysis of trade credit. Our study uncovers novel stylized facts about trade credit both within and across supply chains. More upstream firms borrow more from suppliers, lend more to customers, and hold more net trade credit. This upstreamness effect in trade credit is weaker for more profitable firms and for longer chains. Firms in more central or more profitable chains provide more net trade credit. Our results are generally consistent with the recursive moral hazard theory of trade credit. Evidence for the financing advantage theory is mixed.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002488
