Journal of Labor Economics,2026,Work Boots to Combat Boots: Mass Layoffs and Military Enlistment,Francis Murphy and Sarah Turner,"Weak local labor market conditions may change the trajectories of young adults who expected to find work. Well-documented responses include increasing educational investments, moving to more prosperous labor markets, or reducing labor force attachment. Military enlistment is a channel of potential adjustment that has received less study. Using data on Army recruits, we demonstrate a significant local response in enlistment to mass layoffs, characterized by increased labor supply to the military rather than increased local military recruiting. Our work documents the significance of military employment as an important arm of adjustment to local labor market shocks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732775
Journal of Labor Economics,2026,Party On: The Labor Market Returns to Social Networks in Adolescence,"Adriana Lleras-Muney, Matthew Miller, Shuyang Sheng and Veronica Sovero","We investigate the returns to adolescent friendships on earnings in adulthood using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Because both education and friendships are jointly determined in adolescence, ordinary least squares estimates of their returns are likely biased. We implement a novel procedure to obtain bounds on the causal returns to friendships: we assume that the returns to schooling range from 5% to 15% (on the basis of prior literature) and instrument for friendships using similarity in age among peers. Having one more friend in adolescence increases earnings between 7% and 14%, substantially more than ordinary least squares estimates would suggest.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/731308
Journal of Labor Economics,2026,The Long-Run Effects of Consequential School Accountability,Jonathan Mansfield and David Slichter,"The rise of accountability programs was perhaps the most noticeable change in American education during the 1990s and early 2000s. We measure how these programs affected students’ long-run outcomes. We find increases in income, occupational skill level, and attainment, though the labor market effects are insignificant in most specifications. A typical accountability regime with high-stakes testing in seven grades increased attainment by 0.1 years. Last, the pattern of occupational skill usage does not support concerns about teaching to the test. Our results suggest that accountability was more likely beneficial than harmful for students’ human capital.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/731324
Journal of Labor Economics,2026,Trade Competition and the Decline in Union Organizing: Evidence from Certification Elections,"Kerwin Kofi Charles, Matthew S. Johnson and Nagisa Tadjfar","The long-term decline in US workers’ attempts to organize labor unions accelerated after 2000. We find that the swift rise of imports from China arising from a change in trade policy accounts for nearly all of this post-2000 acceleration: union certification elections decreased substantially among workers in manufacturing industries directly exposed to imports, but also among workers indirectly exposed through their local labor market. Consistent with a simple model of workers’ decision to seek union representation, direct exposure lowered the expected wage gain from unionization, whereas indirect exposure increased the cost of job loss—both of which discourage organizing.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732302
Journal of Labor Economics,2026,The Impact of a Prototypical Home Visiting Program on Child Skills,"Jin Zhou, James Heckman, Bei Liu and Mai Lu","This paper develops and applies a new framework for estimating the causal impacts on child skills and the mechanisms producing these impacts using data from a large-scale randomized controlled study of a widely evaluated early-childhood home visiting program. We compare estimates from procedures that report treatment effects as unweighted averages of item scores with estimates adjusting for item difficulties. We generalize item response theory and Rasch model frameworks and estimate vectors of individual-level latent skills, comparing treatment and control group skills and their impacts on test scores. The program substantially improves multiple skills.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732301
Journal of Labor Economics,2026,Differences in On-the-Job Learning across Firms,Jaime Arellano-Bover and Fernando Saltiel,"We present evidence that is consistent with large disparities across firms in their on-the-job learning opportunities using administrative datasets from Brazil and Italy. We categorize firms into discrete “classes”—which our conceptual framework interprets as skill-learning classes—using a clustering methodology that groups together firms with similar distributions of unexplained wage growth. Mincerian returns to experience vary widely across experiences acquired in different firm classes. Four tests leveraging firm movers, occupation/industry switchers, hiring wages, and displaced workers point toward a portable and general human capital interpretation. Heterogeneous employment experiences explain an important share of wage variance by age 35.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732357
Journal of Labor Economics,2026,The Multigenerational Impact of Children and Childcare Policies,"Sencer Karademir, Jean-William Laliberté and Stefan Staubli","This paper examines the multigenerational impact of children and whether the public provision of formal childcare lessens the earnings and employment impacts of children. We find that the arrival of a firstborn reduces employment and earnings of mothers and employment of grandmothers. Studying a universal childcare program in Quebec, we find that formal childcare increases the employment rates of mothers as well as that of grandmothers to a lesser extent. Examining heterogeneity of the program’s impact across census divisions, we find a negative correlation between the positive effects on mothers’ employment and the prepolicy supply of informal childcare by grandmothers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732358
Journal of Labor Economics,2026,University Loans and Grants: Effects on Educational and Labor Market Outcomes,Alex Solís,"This study examines the long-term effects of student loans and grants in Chile through a regression discontinuity design. It finds that university loans significantly boost degree completion, especially among women and low-income students, with marginal positive effects on employment and earnings for women. Vocational loans benefit only those ineligible for university loans. Conversely, grants, alongside loans, do not affect education or labor market outcomes. The limited impact of the tuition reductions induced by grants, combined with the substantial gains for low-income students, highlights the presence of credit constraints.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732517
Journal of Labor Economics,2026,Spatial Diffusion of Local Economic Shocks in Social Networks: Evidence from the US Fracking Boom,Andreas Diemer,"I study the role of social networks in the propagation of economic shocks across space. Combining comprehensive data on US online friendships with extraction activity during the fracking boom, I show that exogenous changes in economic conditions in one area affect outcomes in socially proximate places, regardless of how far apart they are geographically. Social exposure to fracking generates a wage spillover amounting to one-third of every dollar of energy produced in a county’s social network. This spillover decays slowly in space and is associated with a large mobility response. Diffusion mainly stems from the commuting of transient fracking workers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732300
Journal of Labor Economics,2026,From Unemployment to Self-Employment: An Evaluation of Self-Employment Assistance Programs,Alexandre Gaillard and Sumudu Kankanamge,"This paper evaluates self-employment assistance (SEA) programs, which are government initiatives extending the unemployment insurance system to support unemployment to self-employment transitions. Using a general equilibrium model of the US labor market, we show that these programs have important labor market mobility effects and increase the self-employment rate. They also significantly impact the composition and performance outcomes of self-employment: while lump-sum subsidies select low-skilled individuals, SEA programs contingent on previously employed earnings select skilled and wealthier individuals. At the aggregate level, the latter programs mainly reallocate individuals from employment to self-employment, leaving the unemployment rate largely unaffected.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732765
