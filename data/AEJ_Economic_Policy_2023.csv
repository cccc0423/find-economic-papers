AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Do Credit Supply Shocks Affect Employment in Middle-Income Countries?,"Emilio Gutierrez, David Jaume and Martin Tobal","This paper studies the effect of bank credit supply shocks on formal employment in Mexico using a proprietary dataset containing information on all loans extended to firms by commercial banks during 2010–2015. We find large impacts on the formal employment of small and medium firms: a positive credit shock of 1 standard deviation increases yearly employment by 1.4 percentage points. The shares of uncollateralized credit and credit received by family firms, younger firms, and firms with no previous bank relationships also increase, suggesting that credit shocks may play a more prominent role for employment creation in credit-constrained settings.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210354
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Public and Private Options in Practice: The Military Health System,"Michael D. Frakes, Jonathan Gruber and Timothy Justicz","Recent debates over health care reform, including in the context of the Military Health System (MHS) and Veterans Administration, highlight the dispute between public and private provision of health care services. Using novel data on childbirth claims from the MHS and drawing on the combination of plausibly exogenous patient moves and heterogeneity across bases in the availability of base hospitals, we identify the impact of receiving obstetrical care on versus off military bases. We find evidence that off-base care is associated with slightly greater resource intensity, but also notably better outcomes, suggesting marginal efficiency gains from care privatization.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210625
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Age Discrimination across the Business Cycle,Gordon Dahl and Matthew Knepper,"We test whether age discrimination rises during recessions using two complementary analyses. Confidential EEOC microdata reveal that age-related firing and hiring charges rise by 3.3 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, for each percentage point increase in a state-industry's monthly unemployment. Though the opportunity cost of filing falls, the fraction of meritorious claims increases—a sufficient condition for rising discrimination under plausible assumptions. Second, we repurpose data from hiring correspondence studies conducted across different cities and time periods during the recovery from the Great Recession. Each percentage point increase in local unemployment reduces the callback rate for older versus younger women by 15 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210169
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,My Professor Cares: Experimental Evidence on the Role of Faculty Engagement,Scott Carrell and Michal Kurlaender,"We provide experimental evidence on the impact of specific faculty behaviors aimed at increasing student success for college students from historically underrepresented groups. The intervention was developed after conducting in-person focus groups and a pilot experiment. We find significant positive treatment effects across a multitude of short- and longer-run outcomes. Specifically, underrepresented students in the treatment report more positive perceptions of the professor and earned higher course grades. These positive effects persisted over the next several years, with students in the treatment more likely to persist in college, resulting in increased credit accumulation and degree completion.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210699
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Public Pension Reforms and Retirement Decisions: Narrative Evidence and Aggregate Implications,Huixin Bi and Sarah Zubairy,"We construct a database of public pension policy changes with motivation and implementation information for ten OECD countries. Structural pension reforms, motivated by long-run sustainability concerns, often come with prolonged phase-in periods. In response to pension retrenchments implemented immediately, people close to retirement stay in the workforce longer. News about future pension retrenchments with implementation lags, however, is likely to lead this group to exit the labor market. This decline in the labor force participation rate is particularly strong for reforms with long lags, ones that introduce fundamental policy changes, and ones where citizens have lower trust in the government.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200881
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Moved to Poverty? A Legacy of the Apartheid Experiment in South Africa,"Bladimir Carrillo, Carlos Charris and Wilman Iglesias","During the South African apartheid, Black people were forced to move to homelands during the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in one of history's largest segregation policy experiments. We examine how and why relocation to the homelands affected human capital attainment. Exploiting the staggered timing of homeland establishment in a cross-cohort identification strategy, we find that moving to the homelands during childhood significantly reduces educational attainment, labor earnings, and employment rates in adulthood. The data suggest an important role for place effects. Moving to the homelands in childhood implies greater exposure to poorer neighborhoods, and it disproportionally reduces human capital attainment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210439
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Dynamic Impacts of School-Based Internet Access on Student Learning: Evidence from Peruvian Public Primary Schools,"Leah Lakdawala, Eduardo Nakasone and Kevin Kho","We investigate the impacts of school-based internet access on second graders' test scores, using over 2 million student observations from a panel of Peruvian public primary schools. We identify effects up to 6+ years after installation on different cohorts of second-grade students, exploiting variation in the timing of internet access induced by the rollout of a national program. We find positive but modest short-run impacts, but importantly, these effects grow for subsequent cohorts. Indeed, short-run estimates alone would have led to different conclusions. These dynamics underscore the value of extended evaluation windows to allow benefits of educational technology to materialize.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200719

Hart and Krzysztof Karbownik","Using a rich dataset that merges student-level school records with birth records, and leveraging a student fixed effects design, we explore how a Florida private school choice program affected public school students' outcomes as the program matured and scaled up. We observe growing benefits (higher standardized test scores and lower absenteeism and suspension rates) to students attending public schools with more preprogram private school options as the program matured. Effects are particularly pronounced for lower-income students, but results are positive for more affluent students as well. Local and district-wide private school competition are both independently related to student outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210710
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Electoral Cycles in Macroprudential Regulation,Karsten Müller,"Do politics matter for macroprudential policies? I show that changes in macroprudential regulation exhibit a predictable electoral cycle in the run-up to 221 elections across 58 countries from 2000 through 2014. Policies restricting mortgages and consumer credit are systematically looser before elections, particularly during economic expansions. Consistent with theories of opportunistic political cycles, this pattern is stronger when election outcomes are uncertain, regulators are closely tied to politicians, and institutions are poor. These results suggest that political pressures may limit the ability of regulators to ""lean against the wind.""",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200626
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Market Power and Price Exposure: Learning from Changes in Renewable Energy Regulation,Natalia Fabra and Imelda Imelda,"Given the critical role of renewable energies in current and future electricity markets, it is important to understand how they affect firms' pricing incentives. We study whether the price-depressing effect of renewables depends on their degree of market price exposure. Paying renewables with fixed prices, rather than market-based prices, is more effective at curbing market power when the dominant firms own large shares of renewables, and vice versa. Our empirical analysis leverages several short-lived changes to renewables regulation in the Spanish market and shows that switching from full-price exposure to fixed prices caused a 2–4 percent reduction in the average price-cost markup.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210221
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,The Effects of Import Competition on Unionization,John S. Ahlquist and Mitch Downey,"We study direct and indirect effects of Chinese import competition on union membership in the United States, 1990–2014. Import competition in manufacturing induced a modest decline in unionization within manufacturing industries. The magnitude is small because unionized manufacturers competed in higher-quality product segments. Manufacturers in right-to-work states experienced more direct competition with low-quality Chinese imports. Outside of manufacturing, however, import competition causes an important increase in union membership, as less educated women shift away from retail and toward jobs in health care and education where unions are stronger. We calculate that Chinese imports prevented 26 percent of the union density decline that would have otherwise occurred.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200709
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Information and Spillovers from Targeting Policy in Peru's Anchoveta Fishery,Gabriel Englander,"This paper establishes that a targeted policy backfires because it reveals information about nontargeted units. In the world's largest fishery, the regulator attempts to reduce the harvesting of juvenile fish by temporarily closing areas where the share of juvenile catch is high. By combining administrative microdata with biologically richer data from fishing firms, I isolate variation in closures that is due to the regulator's lower-resolution data. I estimate substantial temporal and spatial spillovers from closures. Closures increase total juvenile catch by 48 percent because closure announcements implicitly signal that fishing before, just outside, and after closures is high productivity.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210812
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Digitization and the Market for Physical Works: Evidence from the Google Books Project,Abhishek Nagaraj and Imke Reimers,"The free digital distribution of creative works could cannibalize demand for physical versions, but it could also boost physical sales by enabling consumers to discover the original work. We study the impact of the Google Books digitization project on the market for physical books. We find that digitization significantly boosts the demand for physical versions and provide evidence for the discovery channel. Moreover, digitization allows independent publishers to introduce new editions for existing books, further increasing sales. Our results highlight the potential of free digital distribution to strengthen the demand for and supply of physical products.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210702
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Brexit Uncertainty and Its (Dis)service Effects,"Saad Ahmad, Nuno Limão, Sarah Oliver and Serge Shikher","We estimate the impact of increased policy uncertainty from Brexit on UK trade in services. We apply an uncertainty-augmented gravity equation to UK services trade with the European Union at the industry level from 2016:I to 2018:IV. By exploiting the variation in the probability of Brexit from prediction markets interacted with a new trade policy risk measure across service industries, we identify a significant negative impact of the threat of Brexit on trade values and participation. The increased probability of Brexit in this period lowered services exports by at least 20 log points.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200808

An RD Design for R&D, Patents, and Spillovers","Antoine Dechezleprêtre, Elias Einiö, Ralf Martin, Kieu-Trang Nguyen and John van Reenen","We present causal evidence of R&D tax incentives' positive impacts on a firm's own innovation and that of its technological neighbors. Exploiting a change in size-based eligibility thresholds for R&D tax relief, we implement a Regression Discontinuity Design using administrative data. We find significant effects of tax relief on (quality-adjusted) patenting (and R&D) that persist up to seven years, and evidence of R&D spillovers on the innovation of technologically close firms. We can rule out elasticities of patenting with respect to R&D user cost of under 2 at the 5 percent level and show that our large effects are driven by financially constrained treated firms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200739
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Juvenile Crime and Anticipated Punishment,Ashna Arora,"Can sanctions deter juvenile crime? Research indicates that they may not, as offending barely decreases when individuals cross the age of criminal majority and begin to face harsher sanctions. Several models of criminal behavior predict, however, that these small reactions close to the threshold may mask larger behavioral responses among individuals below the age threshold. Policy variation between 2007–2015 in the United States is used to show evidence consistent with these predictions—juvenile crime increases when the age of majority is increased. This increase is driven by younger age groups and is considerably larger than discontinuity estimates at the threshold.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210530
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Sin Taxes and Self-Control,Renke Schmacker and Sinne Smed,"According to theory, ""sin taxes"" are welfare improving if consumers with low self-control respond at least as much to the tax as consumers with high self-control. We investigate empirically if demand response to soft drink and fat tax variations in Denmark depends on consumers' self-control. We use a unique home-scan panel that includes a survey measure of self-control. When taxes increase, consumers with low self-control reduce purchases less strongly than consumers with high self-control. When taxes decrease, both groups increase their purchases similarly. The results show an asymmetry in price elasticities by self-control that is more pronounced when taxes increase.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200479
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Special Economic Zones and Human Capital Investment: 30 Years of Evidence from China,"Fangwen Lu, Weizeng Sun and Jianfeng Wu","By exploiting the large quantity and rich variety of special economic zones (SEZs) in China, this study investigates how such zones affect human capital investment. Results show that SEZs significantly increase the local high school enrollment rate, but the impact varies across zone types: technology-oriented zones encourage education, while export-led zones discourage it. The increased job opportunities and wage premiums inside SEZs for employees with high school education increase high school enrollment, while such opportunities and wages for employees with middle school education decrease enrollment. A very small portion of the impact, if any, can be attributed to increased income.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200492
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Common Practice: Spillovers from Medicare on Private Health Care,"Michael L. Barnett, Andrew Olenski and Adam Sacarny","Efforts to raise US health-care productivity have proceeded slowly, potentially due to the fragmentation of payment across insurers. Each insurer's efforts to improve care could influence how doctors practice for other insurers, leading to unvalued externalities. We study a randomized letter intervention by Medicare to curtail overuse of antipsychotics. The letters did not mention private insurance but reduced prescribing to these patients by 12 percent, much like the 17 percent effect in Medicare. We cannot reject one-for-one spillovers, suggesting that physicians use similar medical practice styles across insurers. Our findings establish that insurers can affect health care well outside their direct purview.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200553

Our dataset allows us to exploit variation in the timing of EITC refunds, including changes related to the 2017 PATH Act, along with cross-state differences in refund magnitudes to identify spending responses. Results show EITC recipients spend about $0.30 per refund dollar ($1,150 for the average refund) within just two weeks of issuance, suggesting stimulus targeted at this population may provide a quick boost to aggregate demand.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200590
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,How Social Security Reform Affects Retirement and Pension Claiming,"Rafael Lalive, Arvind Magesan and Stefan Staubli","A reform increasing the full retirement age (FRA) by one year leads to larger than expected delays in pension claiming and retirement, while making late claiming more lucrative leads to a smaller than expected delay in pension claiming. Survey evidence shows people view the FRA as the ""normal"" retirement age and prefer to couple pension claiming and retirement decisions together, even though these two decisions are not coupled through social security provisions. Two mechanisms are at work: reference dependence with loss aversion in pension claiming, and spillovers from pension claiming on retirement choices.

Our findings suggest that current time allocations are causing examiners to issue low-quality secondary patents on the margin. To assess the merits of expanding ex ante scrutiny of drug patent applications at the agency, we set forth estimates of the various gains and losses associated with giving examiners more time, including reduced downstream litigation costs and added personnel expenses, along with both the static gains and dynamic innovation losses associated with earlier generic entry.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200703
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,The Impact of Organizational Boundaries on Health Care Coordination and Utilization,"Leila Agha, Keith Marzilli Ericson and Xiaoxi Zhao","We measure organizational concentration—the distribution of a patient's health care across organizations—to examine how firm boundaries affect health care efficiency. First, when patients move to regions where outpatient visits are typically concentrated within a small set of firms, their health care utilization falls. Second, for patients whose primary care providers (PCPs) exit the market, switching to a PCP with 1 standard deviation higher organizational concentration reduces utilization by 21 percent. This finding is robust to controlling for the spread of health care across providers. Increases in organizational concentration predict improvements in diabetes care and are not associated with greater use of emergency department or inpatient care.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200841
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Corporate Tax Breaks and Executive Compensation,Eric Ohrn,"I analyze the effect of two corporate tax breaks, bonus depreciation and the Domestic Production Activities Deduction (DPAD), on executive compensation in publicly traded US firms. I find both tax breaks significantly increase executive compensation. For every dollar a firm benefits from the tax breaks, compensation of the firm's top five highest-paid executives increases by $0.17 to $0.25. The tax breaks increase compensation primarily in firms with weaker governance structures, suggesting the compensation response is driven by executive rent extraction.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210155
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Incentivizing School Attendance in the Presence of Parent-Child Information Frictions,Damien de Walque and Christine Valente,"Many countries use CCTs targeted to parents to promote schooling. Attendance conditions may work through two channels: incentivization and information. If children have private information, (i) providing attendance information to parents may increase attendance inexpensively relative to CCTs and (ii) it may be more effective to incentivize children, who have full information, than parents. Tackling both questions in a unified experimental setting, we find that information alone improves parental monitoring and has a large effect relative to our CCT. Incentivizing children is at least as effective as incentivizing parents—importantly, not because parents were able to appropriate transfers to children.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210202
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,The Costs of Misaligned Incentives: Energy Inefficiency and the Principal-Agent Problem,Joshua A. Blonz,"In many settings, misaligned incentives and inadequate monitoring lead employees to take self-interested actions. This paper identifies and quantifies the costs of this principal-agent problem in the context of an energy efficiency appliance replacement program. I show that contractors (agents) hired by the electric utility (the principal) increase their compensation by intentionally misreporting program data to authorize the replacement of nonqualified refrigerators. I estimate that each unqualified replacement reduces program benefits by $106 and saves 30 percent less electricity than replacements that follow program guidelines.

We combine a natural experiment, the random assignment of male conscripts to different locations throughout Spain, with tailored survey data. Being randomly assigned to complete military service outside of one's region of residence fosters contact with conscripts from other regions and increases sympathy and trust toward people from the region of service, as measured decades later.

After the president publicly dismissed the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic and challenged scientific recommendations, social distancing in pro-government localities declined.

We estimate the causal effects of English language training for adult immigrants on participants' civic and economic outcomes using randomized enrollment lotteries from a public adult education program in Massachusetts. Participation doubles voter participation and increases annual earnings by $2,400 (56 percent).

We study Chile's 1988 plebiscite, which ended 15 years of dictatorship and reestablished democracy. Taking advantage of individual-level voting data, we implement an age-based regression discontinuity design comparing long-run registration and turnout rates across marginally eligible and ineligible individuals. We find plebiscite eligibility increased electoral turnout three decades later. The magnitude of the initial mobilization emerges as the mechanism. Plebiscite eligibility induced a sizable share of less-educated voters to register compared to other upstream elections.

I find significant increases in FAFSA completion rates (19 percentage points), and my estimates imply an increase of 1–2 percentage points in college enrollment. There is suggestive evidence that these effects were more concentrated among lower-income students/schools, and merit-based state financial aid applications also increased. The design of this mandate implies that pushing students into action may be more effective than informational nudges and that localized support systems such as counselors are important for the success of a top-down policy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210360

Using runner-up counties as counterfactuals in a difference-in-difference model, I find that establishing a college causes 62 percent more patents per year. Linking patents to novel college yearbook data reveals that only 12 percent of patents in a college's county came from that college's alumni or faculty.

We assess impacts of these differences in delivery practices at childbirth. We find that infants quasi-randomly delivered at hospitals with higher C-section rates are born in better shape and are less likely to be readmitted, with suggestive evidence of improved survival. These benefits are driven by avoidance of prolonged labors that pose risks to infant health. In contrast, these infants are more likely to visit the emergency department for respiratory-related problems, consistent with a large observational literature linking C-section to chronic reductions in respiratory health.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210034
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Optimal Income Taxation with Spillovers from Employer Learning,Ashley Craig,"I study optimal income taxation when human capital investment is imperfectly observable by employers. In the model, Bayesian inference about worker productivity compresses the wage distribution, lowering the private return to human capital investment. An externality arises: given the same information, employers are more optimistic about each individual if workers are generally more productive. The significance of this externality hinges on the accuracy of employers' beliefs and the responsiveness of human capital. For the United States, taking it into account lowers optimal marginal tax rates for most workers, reducing them by a maximum of 9–13 percentage points between $50,000 and $100,000.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210062

Difference-in-difference, instrumental variable, and event study methods show that the pension reform reduces the propensity of childbearing of women of fertile age by 8 percent in the short run. Completed fertility declines by 1.3 children within 20 years after the reform, reducing the contribution base of the pay-as-you-go pension system in the long run.

A stylized bargaining model shows that this is likely driven by the interaction of this reform with Medicaid's ""most-favored customer"" clause (MFCC). By examining the response of drugs that faced a change in incentives equivalent to the removal of Medicaid's MFCC, we estimate that removing the Medicaid MFCC would have reduced overall 2010 non-Medicaid drug spending by an additional 3.5 percent, though it would have likely also increased Medicaid spending.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200688

Focusing on California school boards, I instrument for minority (specifically, Hispanic) representation using random ballot ordering and leverage new data from a statewide capital investment program to capture intradistrict resource allocations. I show that Hispanic board members invest the marginal dollar in high-Hispanic schools within their districts. High-Hispanic schools also exhibit gains in student achievement and decreased teacher turnover.

On-duty injuries increase the probability of officers using force by 7 percent in the subsequent week. Officers are also more likely to injure suspects and receive complaints about neglecting victims and violating constitutional rights. The effect is concentrated in a narrow time window following the event and is not associated with significantly lower injury risk to the officer.

We exploit the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) to study the bond market effects of deferring official debt repayments. Using daily data on sovereign bond spreads and synthetic control methods, we show that countries eligible for official debt relief experience a larger decline in borrowing costs compared to similar, ineligible countries. This decline is stronger for countries that receive a larger relief, suggesting that the effect works through liquidity provision. By contrast, the results do not support the concern that official debt relief could generate stigma on financial markets.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210166

Gender Differences in Regrades in College,Cher Hsuehhsiang Li and Basit Zafar,"Using administrative data from a large public university, we show that male students are 18.6 percent more likely than female students to receive favorable grade changes made by instructors. Surveys of students and instructors reveal that regrade requests are prevalent and that male students are more likely to ask for regrades on the intensive margin. We corroborate the gender differences in regrade requests in an incentivized controlled experiment: we find that males have a higher willingness to pay to ask for regrades. Almost a third of the gender difference is due to gender differences in beliefs and the Big Five traits.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210053
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,Climate Change and Labor Reallocation: Evidence from Six Decades of the Indian Census,"Maggie Liu, Yogita Shamdasani and Vis Taraz","How do rising temperatures affect long-term labor reallocation in developing economies? In this paper we examine how increases in temperature impact structural transformation and urbanization within Indian districts between 1951 and 2011. We find that rising temperatures are associated with lower shares of workers in nonagricultural sectors, with effects intensifying over a longer time frame. Supporting evidence suggests that local demand effects play an important role: declining agricultural productivity under higher temperatures reduces the demand for nonagricultural goods and services, which subsequently lowers nonagricultural labor demand. Our results illustrate that rising temperatures limit sectoral and rural-urban mobility for isolated households.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210129

Though we find billionaires' effective tax rates are only about half the statutory rate, their residential choices are highly sensitive to these taxes, as 35 percent of local billionaires leave states with an estate tax. This tax-induced mobility causes a large reduction in the aggregate tax base. Nonetheless, we find that the revenue benefit of an estate tax exceeds the cost for the vast majority of states.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200685

By combining local leader rotation data and comprehensive firm land parcel purchase data across prefectures from 2006 to 2016, this paper examines how firm-politician connections affect resource allocation and finds that a firm headquartered in a leader's previous work prefecture purchases three times more land parcels in that leader's new governing prefecture than the prefecture-year mean, at half the unit prices. Identification is from within-firm-year variation in various prefectures through exogenous politician rotation. Land usage efficiency is lower for these follower firms' land parcels.

Instead, they have incentives to focus their enforcement efforts on relocating profits booked by multinationals in other high-tax countries, crowding out the enforcement on transactions that shift profits to tax havens, and reducing the global tax payments of multinational companies. The predictions of our model are motivated and supported by the analysis of two new datasets: the universe of transfer price corrections conducted by the Danish tax authority, and new cross-country data on international tax enforcement.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200200

I analyze whether emissions of power producers are independent from allowance allocations by leveraging a change in allocation policy for a difference-in-difference strategy. The evidence suggests that the independence property holds overall and for larger emitters and that firms respond to the loss in allocation by increasing allowance purchases. Suggestive evidence for small emitters indicates that trading costs or behavioral bias distorts their emission decisions. However, their small emission share leaves the independence property intact at the sector level.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210028

Reforms of this special treatment have been debated, but little is known about its costs, benefits, and redistributive implications. I estimate a life cycle model of single retirees accounting for this exemption. It shows that the homestead exemption explains important patterns of Medicaid recipiency and that it is highly valued. It also shows that estate recovery could cover most of its costs with possibly limited negative welfare consequences. Finally, the model predicts that removing the homestead exemption or enforcing estate recovery programs would reduce redistribution toward lower-income retirees.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200178

We find that improvements in early childhood education led to large (20 percent) reductions in later criminal behavior, reductions that far exceed those implied by estimates of test score gains in prior studies. While the benefits generated account for a large portion of the costs of the education provided, we find substantial relative gains from the targeting of funds to high-poverty areas and areas without existing access to subsidized care.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200660

These schemes tax multinationals by allocating their ""routine"" profits to source countries and sharing their remaining ""residual"" profit across countries on some formulaic basis. This paper explores the implications, conceptual and empirical, of moving to some form of RPA. Residual profits are estimated to be substantial and concentrated in relatively few multinational enterprises. The impact on tax revenue appears beneficial for developing countries.

However, there is no direct evidence that firms react to audits in this way. We conducted a large-scale field experiment in collaboration with a tax authority to address this question. We sent letters to 20,440 small- and medium-sized firms that collectively paid more than US$200 million in taxes per year. We find that providing information about audits significantly affected tax compliance but in a manner that was inconsistent with Allingham and Sandmo (1972).",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200321

The program focused on improving the energy efficiency of school buildings, making it possible to use the number of schools as an instrument for investments. It also enforced tight deadlines, reducing potential implementation lags. The program was cost-effective, creating, on average, one job for one year for an investment of €24,000. The employment gains are detectable after nine months and are accompanied by an unemployment reduction amounting to half of the job creation.

AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,SOEs and Soft Incentive Constraints in State Bank Lending,"Yiming Cao, Raymond Fisman, Hui Lin and Yongxiang Wang","We study how Chinese state bank managers' lending incentives impact lending to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). We show lending quantity increases and quality decreases at month's end, indicating monthly lending targets that decrease lending standards. Increased quantity comes from both SOEs and private lending, whereas decreased quality is from only SOEs, which continue to receive loans even after prior defaults (particularly at month's end). We suggest that SOE lending may thus be beneficial for state bank managers, who lend to delinquent state enterprises to meet targets, which in turn may exacerbate SOEs' soft budget constraints.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200873

Over 18 months it was revealed that the switch exposed residents to dangerous levels of lead, culminating in an emergency declaration in October 2015. This paper examines the impact of this crisis on the Flint housing market. The value of Flint's housing stock has fallen by $520 million to $559 million despite over $400 million in remediation spending.

We document that sequential banking is pervasive with substantial effects. Using credit card applications from a large bank and data on the applicants' entire loan portfolios, we find that an additional credit line causes a 5.9 percentage point decline in default for high-score borrowers on previous loans. However, for low-score borrowers, it causes a 19 percentage point increase. The former use the new credit to smooth payments on preexisting loans, while the latter increase their total debt.

The program is more effective and much more cost effective than asking Community Health Workers (CHWs) to distribute free chlorine to households during routine monthly visits. This is because only 40 percent of households use free chlorine, targeting through CHWs is worse than self-targeting through coupon redemption, and water treatment promotion by CHWs does not increase chlorine use among beneficiaries of free chlorine.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210121

Evidence remains limited, however, on the extent to which work requirements increase economic self-sufficiency or screen out vulnerable individuals. Using linked administrative data on food stamps (SNAP) and earnings with a regression discontinuity design, we find robust evidence that work requirements increase program exits by 23 percentage points (64 percent) among incumbent participants. Overall program participation among adults who are subject to work requirements is reduced by 53 percent. Homeless adults are disproportionately screened out.

These owners use most losses contemporaneously, reducing the tax asymmetry compared to C corporations. However, these owners face distortions due to the progressive individual tax schedule. The value of this asymmetry is approximately $3.5 billion per year. We find that this asymmetry creates disincentives for risky investment and causes allocative inefficiencies among loss and gains owners. Finally, we simulate the effects of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; we estimate that these provisions—especially section 199A—reduce the behavioral distortions of the asymmetry for S corporate owners.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200311

The key empirical challenge is that school board composition is endogenously determined through the electoral process. To overcome this, we develop a novel research design that leverages California's randomized assignment of the order that candidate names appear on election ballots. We find that an additional educator elected to the school board reduces charter schooling and increases teacher salaries in the school district relative to other board members. We interpret these findings as consistent with educator board members shifting bargaining in favor of teachers' unions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200435
AEJ: Economic Policy,2023,What Does a Provider Network Do? Evidence from Random Assignment in Medicaid Managed Care,Jacob Wallace,"Leveraging the random assignment of over 50,000 Medicaid enrollees in New York, I present causal evidence that narrower networks are a blunt instrument for reducing health care spending. While narrower networks constrain spending, they do so by generating hassle costs that reduce quantity, with modest effects on prices paid to providers. Enrollees assigned to narrower networks use fewer of both needed and unneeded services and are less satisfied with their plans. Using my causal estimates to construct counterfactuals, I identify an alternative assignment policy that reduces spending without harming satisfaction by matching consumers with narrower networks that include their providers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210162

Our treatment boosts the mathematics scores of the low-achieving students. Moreover, the treatment enhances the extraversion and agreeableness of high- and low-achieving students, thereby providing evidence that peers can influence personality traits.
