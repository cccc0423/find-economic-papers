Journal of Political Economy,2020,"Declining Search Frictions, Unemployment, and Growth",Paolo Martellini and Guido Menzio,"For a search-theoretic model of the labor market, we seek conditions for the existence of a balanced growth path (BGP), where unemployment, vacancy, and worker’s transitions rates remain constant in the face of improvements in the production and search technologies. A BGP exists iff firm-worker matches are inspection goods and the quality of a match is drawn from a Pareto distribution. Declining search frictions contribute to growth with an intensity determined by the tail coefficient of the Pareto distribution. We develop a strategy to measure the rate of decline of search frictions and their contribution to growth.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710975
Journal of Political Economy,2020,What Goes Up May Not Come Down: Asymmetric Incidence of Value-Added Taxes,"Youssef Benzarti, Dorian Carloni, Jarkko Harju and Tuomas Kosonen","This paper provides evidence that prices respond significantly more strongly to increases than to decreases in value-added taxes (VATs). First, using two plausibly exogenous VAT changes, we show that prices respond twice as much to VAT increases as to VAT decreases. Second, we show that this asymmetry results in higher equilibrium profits and markups. Third, we find that firms operating with low profit margins are particularly likely to respond asymmetrically to VAT changes. Fourth, these asymmetric price effects persist several years after VAT changes take place. Fifth, using all VAT changes in the European Union from 1996 to 2015, we find similar levels of asymmetry.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710558
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Ex Ante Returns and Occupational Choice,"Peter Arcidiacono, V. Joseph Hotz, Arnaud Maurel and Teresa Romano","Using data from Duke University undergraduates, we make three main contributions to the literature. First, we show that data on earnings beliefs and probabilities of choosing particular occupations are highly informative of future earnings and occupations. Second, we show how beliefs data can be used to recover ex ante treatment effects and their relationship with individual choices. We find large differences in expected earnings across occupations and provide evidence of sorting on expected gains. Finally, nonpecuniary factors play an important role, with a sizable share of individuals willing to give up substantial amounts of earnings by not choosing their highest-paying occupation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710559
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Commitment versus Flexibility with Costly Verification,Marina Halac and Pierre Yared,"A principal faces an agent who is better informed but biased toward higher actions. She can verify the agent’s information and specify his permissible actions. We show that if the verification cost is small enough, a threshold with an escape clause (TEC) is optimal: the agent either chooses an action below a threshold or requests verification and the efficient action above the threshold. For higher costs, however, the principal may require verification only for intermediate actions, dividing the delegation set. TEC is always optimal if the principal cannot commit to inefficient allocations following the verification decision and result.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710560
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Welfare Analysis with Heterogeneous Risk Preferences,Maya Eden,"How much should society be willing to pay for reducing inequality? The standard approach to this normative question relates inequality aversion to risk aversion by treating inequality as an outcome of a lottery. However, in the presence of heterogeneous risk preferences, it is unclear whose preferences should be used for evaluating this lottery. This paper derives a social welfare function as a limit of an iterative procedure, in which each iteration constructs a lottery based on the certainty equivalents from the previous iteration. The limit of this procedure can be interpreted as the equally distributed equivalent of the initial allocation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710561
Journal of Political Economy,2020,A/B Testing with Fat Tails,"Eduardo Azevedo, Alex Deng, José Luis Montiel Olea, Justin Rao and E. Glen Weyl","We propose a new framework for optimal experimentation, which we term the “A/B testing problem.” Our model departs from the existing literature by allowing for fat tails. Our key insight is that the optimal strategy depends on whether most gains accrue from typical innovations or from rare, unpredictable large successes. If the tails of the unobserved distribution of innovation quality are not too fat, the standard approach of using a few high-powered “big” experiments is optimal. However, if the distribution is very fat tailed, a “lean” strategy of trying more ideas, each with possibly smaller sample sizes, is preferred. Our theoretical results, along with an empirical analysis of Microsoft Bing’s EXP platform, suggest that simple changes to business practices could increase innovation productivity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710607

Journal of Political Economy,2020,Political Cycles and Stock Returns,Lubos Pastor and Pietro Veronesi,"We develop a model of political cycles driven by time-varying risk aversion. Agents choose to work in the public or private sector and to vote Democratic or Republican. In equilibrium, when risk aversion is high, agents elect Democrats—the party promising more redistribution. The model predicts higher average stock market returns under Democratic presidencies, explaining the well-known “presidential puzzle.” The model can also explain why economic growth has been faster under Democratic presidencies. In the data, Democratic voters are more risk averse, and risk aversion declines during Democratic presidencies. Public workers vote Democratic, while entrepreneurs vote Republican, as the model predicts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710532
Journal of Political Economy,2020,How Do Doctors Respond to Incentives? Unintended Consequences of Paying Doctors to Reduce Costs,Diane Alexander,"Billions of dollars have been spent on pilot programs searching for ways to reduce health care costs. I study one such program, in which hospitals pay doctors bonuses for reducing the total hospital costs of admitted Medicare patients. Doctors respond to the bonuses by becoming more likely to admit patients whose treatment can generate high bonuses and sorting healthier patients into participating hospitals. Conditional on patient health, however, doctors do not reduce costs or change procedure use. These results highlight the ability of doctors to game incentive schemes and the risks of basing nationwide health care reforms on pilot programs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710334
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Firm Volatility in Granular Networks,"Bernard Herskovic, Bryan Kelly, Hanno Lustig and Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh","Firm volatilities comove strongly over time, and their common factor is the dispersion of the economy-wide firm size distribution. In the cross section, smaller firms and firms with a more concentrated customer base display higher volatility. Network effects are essential to explaining the joint evolution of the empirical firm size and firm volatility distributions. We propose and estimate a simple network model of firm volatility in which shocks to customers influence their suppliers. Larger suppliers have more customers, and customer-supplier links depend on customers’ size. The model produces distributions of firm volatility, size, and customer concentration consistent with the data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710345
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Copyrights and Creativity: Evidence from Italian Opera in the Napoleonic Age,Michela Giorcelli and Petra Moser,"This paper exploits variation in the adoption of copyrights within Italy—due to the timing of Napoléon’s military victories—to investigate the causal effects of copyrights on creativity. Baseline regressions compare changes in opera production across Italian states with and without copyrights. This analysis yields three main results. First, the adoption of copyrights led to a significant increase in the number of newly created operas. Second, copyrights raised the quality of new operas, measured both by their immediate success and by their longevity. Third, there were no benefits from copyright extensions beyond the life of the original creator.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710534
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Productivity and Organization in Portuguese Firms,"Lorenzo Caliendo, Giordano Mion, Luca David Opromolla and Esteban Rossi-Hansberg","Using employer-employee matched and firm production quantity and input data for Portuguese firms, we study the endogenous response of productivity to firm reorganizations as measured by changes in the number of management layers. We show that, as a result of an exogenous demand or productivity shock that makes the firm reorganize and add a management layer, quantity-based productivity increases by about 6%, while revenue-based productivity drops by around 3%. Such a reorganization makes the firm more productive but also increases the quantity produced to an extent that lowers the price charged by the firm and, as a result, its revenue-based productivity as well.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710533
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Equilibrium Labor Market Search and Health Insurance Reform,Naoki Aizawa and Hanming Fang,"We present and empirically implement an equilibrium labor market search model where risk-averse workers facing medical expenditure shocks are matched with firms making health insurance coverage decisions. We use our estimated model to evaluate the equilibrium impact of many health care reform proposals, including the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA). We use the estimates of the early impact of the ACA as a model validation. We find that income-based subsidies for health insurance premiums are crucial for the sustainability of the ACA, while the ACA can still substantially reduce the uninsured rate without the individual or the employer mandate.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710535
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Occupational Licensing and Maternal Health: Evidence from Early Midwifery Laws,"D. Mark Anderson, Ryan Brown, Kerwin Kofi Charles and Daniel I. Rees","Exploiting variation across states and municipalities in the timing and details of midwifery laws introduced during the period 1900–1940 and using data assembled from various primary sources, we find that requiring midwives to be licensed reduced maternal mortality by 7%–8% and may have led to modest reductions in infant mortality. These estimates represent the strongest evidence to date that licensing restrictions can improve the health of consumers and are directly relevant to ongoing policy debates on the merits of licensing midwives.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710555

Journal of Political Economy,2020,Moral Values and Voting,Benjamin Enke,"This paper studies the supply of and demand for moral values in recent US presidential elections. Using a combination of large-scale survey data and text analyses, I find support for the hypothesis that both voters and politicians exhibit heterogeneity in their emphasis on universalist relative to communal moral values and that politicians’ vote shares partly reflect the extent to which their moral appeal matches the values of the electorate. Over the last decade, Americans’ values have become increasingly communal—especially in rural areas—which generated increased moral polarization and is associated with changes in voting patterns across space.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708857
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Intergenerational Redistribution in the Great Recession,"Andrew Glover, Jonathan Heathcote, Dirk Krueger and José-Víctor Ríos-Rull","The Great Recession saw sharp drops in labor earnings and even larger declines in asset prices. How were the welfare losses from these declines distributed across different age groups? To address this question we construct an overlapping-generations general equilibrium model in which households face large aggregate shocks. A calibrated version of the model replicates observed dynamics for asset prices. Younger households experience larger earnings losses in a model Great Recession, but benefit from being able to buy assets at temporarily depressed prices. As a result, the model predicts that the young experience smaller welfare losses than older cohorts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708820
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Collusion in Markets with Syndication,"John William Hatfield, Scott Kominers, Richard Lowery and Jordan M. Barry","Many markets are syndicated, including those for initial public offerings, club deal leveraged buyouts, and debt issuances; in such markets, each winning bidder invites competitors to join a syndicate to complete production. We show that in syndicated markets, collusion may become easier as market concentration falls and market entry may facilitate collusion. In particular, firms can sustain collusion by refusing to syndicate with any firm that undercuts the collusive price, thereby raising that firm’s production costs. Our results can thus rationalize the paradoxical empirical observations that many real-world syndicated markets exhibit seemingly collusive pricing despite low levels of market concentration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/709953
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Identification in Auction Models with Interdependent Costs,Paulo Somaini,"This paper provides a nonparametric identification result for procurement models with asymmetric bidders, dependent private information, and interdependent costs. For risk-neutral bidders, the model’s payoff-relevant primitives are the joint distribution of private information and each bidder’s full-information expected cost. The joint distribution of bids identifies the joint distribution of signals. First-order conditions identify the expected cost conditional on tying with at least one competitor for the lowest bid. I show identification of each bidder’s full-information cost, using variation in competitors’ cost shifters that are excludable from bidders’ own full-information costs, and generate variation in the set of competitors’ signals that induce a tie for the lowest bid. I estimate the relevant payoff primitives using data from Michigan highway procurements and evaluate policies that affect the winner’s curse’s severity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/709970
Journal of Political Economy,2020,"Common Values, Unobserved Heterogeneity, and Endogenous Entry in US Offshore Oil Lease Auctions","Giovanni Compiani, Philip Haile and Marcelo Sant’Anna","Although an auction of drilling rights is often cited as an example of common values, formal evidence has been limited by the problem of auction-level unobserved heterogeneity. We develop an empirical approach for first-price sealed-bid auctions with affiliated values, unobserved heterogeneity, and endogenous bidder entry. We show that important features of the model are nonparametrically identified and apply a semiparametric estimation approach to data from US offshore oil and gas lease auctions. We find that common values, affiliated private information, and unobserved heterogeneity are all present. Failing to account for unobserved heterogeneity obscures the evidence of common values. We examine implications of our estimates for the interaction between affiliation, the winner’s curse, the auction rules, and the number of bidders in determining the aggressiveness of bidding and seller revenue.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710026
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Motivated False Memory,"Soo Hong Chew, Wei Huang and Xiaojian Zhao","People often forget and sometimes fantasize. This paper reports a large-scale experiment on memory errors and their relation to preferential traits including time preference, attitudes toward risk and ambiguity, and psychological characteristics such as anticipatory feelings. We observe systematic incidences of false memory in favor of positive events and positive amnesia in forgetting past negative events. Both positive delusion and positive confabulation significantly relate to present bias, but this is not the case for positive amnesia. In an intraperson, multiple-self model, we demonstrate that positive false memory, rather than selective amnesia, serves to enhance confidence in one’s future self in equilibrium, thereby accounting for our experimental findings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/709971
Journal of Political Economy,2020,The Economic Origins of Conflict in Africa,Eoin McGuirk and Marshall Burke,"We study the impact of global food price shocks on local violence across Africa. In food-producing areas, higher prices reduce conflict over the control of territory (“factor conflict”) and increase conflict over the appropriation of surplus (“output conflict”). We argue that this difference arises because higher prices increase the opportunity cost of soldiering for producers while simultaneously inducing consumers to appropriate surplus as real wages fall. In areas without crop agriculture, higher prices increase both forms of conflict. We validate our local-level findings on output conflict using survey data. Our findings help reconcile a growing but ambiguous literature on the economic roots of conflict.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/709993

Journal of Political Economy,2020,The Housing Boom and Bust: Model Meets Evidence,"Greg Kaplan, Kurt Mitman and Giovanni L. Violante","We build a model of the US economy with multiple aggregate shocks that generate fluctuations in equilibrium house prices. Through counterfactual experiments, we study the housing boom-bust around the Great Recession, with three main results. First, the main driver of movements in house prices and rents was a shift in beliefs, not a change in credit conditions. Second, the boom-bust in house prices explains half of the corresponding swings in nondurable expenditures through a wealth effect. Third, a large-scale debt forgiveness program would have done little to temper the collapse of house prices and expenditures but would have dramatically reduced foreclosures and induced a small, but persistent, increase in consumption during the recovery.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708816
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Experience of Communal Conflicts and Intergroup Lending,"Raymond Fisman, Arkodipta Sarkar, Janis Skrastins and Vikrant Vig","We provide microeconomic evidence on ethnic frictions and market efficiency, using dyadic data on managers and borrowers from a large Indian bank. We conjecture that, if exposure to religion-based communal violence intensifies intergroup animosity, riot exposure will lead to lending decisions that are more sensitive to a borrower’s religion. We find that riot-exposed Hindu branch managers lend relatively less to Muslim borrowers and that these loans are less likely to default, consistent with riot exposure exacerbating taste-based discrimination. This bias is persistent across a bank officer’s tenure, suggesting that the economic costs of ethnic conflict are long-lasting, potentially spanning across generations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708856

Following 800,000 children differentially exposed to the phaseout of leaded gasoline in Sweden, we find that even a low exposure affects long-run outcomes, that boys are more affected, and that changes in noncognitive skills explain a sizeable share of the impact on crime and human capital. The effects are greater above exposure thresholds still relevant for the general population, and reductions in exposure equivalent to the magnitude of the recent redefinition of elevated blood lead levels can increase earnings by 4%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708725
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Credit Market Disruptions and Liquidity Spillover Effects in the Supply Chain,Anna Costello,"How do shocks to the banking sector travel through the corporate economy? Using a novel data set of interfirm sales, I show that suppliers exposed to a large and exogenous decline in bank financing pass this liquidity shock to their downstream customers. The spillover effect occurs through two channels: a reduction in trade credit offered and a reduction in the total supply of goods and services. After exposure to the spillover, downstream customers show a spike in credit risk and a reduction in employment. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of financial spillovers in explaining corporate sector outcomes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708736

Steins","This paper introduces a new long-run data set based on archival data from historical waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances. Studying the joint distribution of household income and wealth, we expose the central importance of portfolio composition and asset prices for wealth dynamics in postwar America. Asset prices shift the wealth distribution because of systematic differences in household portfolios along the wealth distribution. Middle-class portfolios are dominated by housing, while rich households predominantly own business equity. Differential changes in equity and house prices shaped wealth dynamics in postwar America and decoupled the income and wealth distribution over extended periods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708815
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Self-Fulfilling Runs: Evidence from the US Life Insurance Industry,"Nathan Foley-Fisher, Borghan Narajabad and Stephane Verani","The interaction of worsening fundamentals and strategic complementarities among investors renders identification of self-fulfilling runs challenging. We propose a dynamic model to show how exogenous variation in firms’ liability structures can be exploited to obtain variation in the strength of strategic complementarities. Applying this identification strategy to puttable securities offered by US life insurers, we find that at least 40% of the $18 billion run on life insurers by institutional investors during the 2007–8 crisis was amplified by self-fulfilling expectations. Our findings suggest that other contemporaneous runs in shadow banking by institutional investors may have had a self-fulfilling component.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708817
Journal of Political Economy,2020,"Vertical Integration, Supplier Behavior, and Quality Upgrading among Exporters","Christopher Hansman, Jonas Hjort, Gianmarco León-Ciliotta and Matthieu Teachout","We study the relationship between firms’ output quality and organizational structure. Using data on the production and transaction chain that makes up Peruvian fish meal manufacturing, we establish three results. First, firms integrate suppliers when the quality premium rises for exogenous reasons. Second, suppliers change their behavior to better maintain input quality when vertically integrated. Third, firms produce a higher share of high-quality output when weather and supplier availability shocks shift them into using integrated suppliers. Overall, our results indicate that quality upgrading is an important motive for integrating suppliers facing a quantity-quality trade-off, as classical theories of the firm predict.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708818
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Surprise! Out-of-Network Billing for Emergency Care in the United States,"Zack Cooper, Fiona Scott Morton and Nathan Shekita","In the United States, hospitals and physicians independently negotiate contracts with insurers. Therefore, a privately insured individual can be treated at an in-network hospital’s emergency department but receive a large unexpected bill from an out-of-network emergency physician working at that facility. Because patients do not choose their emergency physician, emergency physicians can remain out of network and charge high prices without losing patient volume. We illustrate that this strong outside option improves physicians’ bargaining power with insurers. We conclude by analyzing New York’s efforts to address out-of-network billing through binding arbitration between physicians and insurers over out-of-network payments. This intervention reduced out-of-network billing by 12.8 percentage points (88%).",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708819
Journal of Political Economy,2020,The Tail That Wags the Economy: Beliefs and Persistent Stagnation,"Julian Kozlowski, Laura Veldkamp and Venky Venkateswaran","The Great Recession was a deep downturn with long-lasting effects on credit, employment, and output. While narratives about its causes abound, the persistence of gross domestic product below precrisis trends remains puzzling. We propose a simple persistence mechanism that can be quantified and combined with existing models. Our key premise is that agents do not know the true distribution of shocks but use data to estimate it nonparametrically. Then, transitory events, especially extreme ones, generate persistent changes in beliefs and macro outcomes. Embedding this mechanism in a neoclassical model, we find that it endogenously generates persistent drops in economic activity after tail events.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707735
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Debates: Voting and Expenditure Responses to Political Communication,"Kelly Bidwell, Katherine Casey and Rachel Glennerster","Candidate debates have a rich history and remain integral to contemporary campaign strategy. There is, however, little evidence that they affect the behavior of voters or politicians. The scarcity of political information in the developing world offers an attractive testing ground. Using experimental variation in Sierra Leone, we find that public debate screenings build political knowledge that changes the way people vote, which induces a campaign expenditure response by candidates and fosters accountability pressure over the spending of elected officials. Results show how political communication can trigger a chain of events that begins with voters and ultimately influences policy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706862
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Improving College Instruction through Incentives,Andy Brownback and Sally Sadoff,"In a field experiment, we examine the impact of performance-based incentives for community college instructors. Instructor incentives improve student exam scores, course grades, and credit accumulation while reducing course dropout. Effects are largest among part-time adjunct instructors. During the program, instructor incentives have large positive spillovers, increasing completion rates and grades in students’ courses outside our study. One year after the program, instructor incentives increase transfer rates to 4-year colleges with no impact on 2-year college degrees. We find no evidence of complementarities between instructor incentives and student incentives. Finally, while instructors initially prefer gain-framed contracts over our loss-framed ones, preferences for loss-framed contracts significantly increase after experience with them.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707025
Journal of Political Economy,2020,On the Identification of Gross Output Production Functions,"Amit Gandhi, Salvador Navarro and David Rivers","We study the nonparametric identification of gross output production functions under the environment of the commonly employed proxy variable methods. We show that applying these methods to gross output requires additional sources of variation in the demand for flexible inputs (e.g., prices). Using a transformation of the firm’s first-order condition, we develop a new nonparametric identification strategy for gross output that can be employed even when additional sources of variation are not available. Monte Carlo evidence and estimates from Colombian and Chilean plant-level data show that our strategy performs well and is robust to deviations from the baseline setting.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707736

In the short run, high-immigration locations see their low-skilled labor force increase, native low-skilled wages decrease, and the relative price of rentals increase. Internal relocation dissipates this shock spatially. In the long run, the only lasting consequences are (a) worse labor market conditions for low-skilled natives who entered the labor force in high-immigration years, and (b) lower housing prices in high-immigrant locations, when immigrant workers disproportionately enter the construction sector and lower construction costs.

We find that (truthful) information about reduced delays in state courts in rural Pakistan leads to citizens reporting higher likelihood of using them and to greater allocations to the state in high-stakes lab games. We also find negative indirect effects on nonstate actors and show that these changes are a response to improved beliefs about state actors, which make individuals interact less with nonstate actors and, we argue, induce them to downgrade their beliefs about these actors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707765
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Macroeconomic Drivers of Bond and Equity Risks,"John Campbell, Carolin Pflueger and Luis Viceira","Our new model of consumption-based habit generates time-varying risk premia on bonds and stocks from log-linear, homoskedastic macroeconomic dynamics. Consumers’ first-order condition for the real risk-free bond generates an exactly log-linear consumption Euler equation, commonly assumed in New Keynesian models. We estimate that the correlation between inflation and the output gap switched from negative to positive in 2001. Higher inflation lowers real bond returns, and higher output raises stock returns, which explains why the bond-stock return correlation changed from positive to negative. In the model, risk premia amplify this change in bond-stock return comovement and are crucial for a quantitative explanation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707766

We study whether changes in relative military capabilities make conflicts more likely and find a nonmonotonic relationship between the cost of conflict and the probability of conflict. The game has strategic complements if the cost of conflict is small and there is a large first-mover advantage and has strategic substitutes otherwise. This characterization generates predictions regarding the use of strategic investments—for example, in defense systems. An extension of the model shows how expanding one’s territory today may increase the risk of conflict tomorrow.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707767

Journal of Political Economy,2020,Why Are Older Women Missing in India? The Age Profile of Bargaining Power and Poverty,Rossella Calvi,"Almost half of missing women in India are of postreproductive ages. Can intrahousehold gender inequality and asymmetry in poverty explain a portion of these missing women? Using a natural experiment, I link women’s intrahousehold bargaining power to their mortality risk. Using a structural household model, I estimate the age profile of women’s bargaining power and construct women’s relative poverty rates. I find that women’s bargaining power declines with age, with older women’s poverty rates closely matching their mortality rates by age. This suggests that many missing women might be accounted for by measuring poverty at the individual rather than the household level.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706983

Journal of Political Economy,2020,Persuading the Principal to Wait,"Dmitry Orlov, Andrzej Skrzypacz and Pavel Zryumov","A principal decides when to exercise a real option. A biased agent influences this decision by strategically disclosing information. Committing to disclose all information with a delay is the optimal way to persuade the principal to wait. Without dynamic commitment, this promise is credible only if the agent’s bias is small; otherwise, he pipets information, probabilistically delaying the principal’s action. When the agent is biased toward early exercise, his lack of commitment to remain quiet leads to immediate disclosure, hurting him.

Journal of Political Economy,2020,Queens,Oeindrila Dube and S. P. Harish,"Do states experience more peace under female leadership? We examine this question in the context of Europe over the fifteenth to twentieth centuries. We use gender of the firstborn and presence of a sister among previous monarchs as instruments for queenly rule. We find that polities led by queens engaged in war more than polities led by kings. While single queens were more likely to be attacked than single kings, married queens were more likely to attack than married kings. These results suggest asymmetries in the division of labor: married queens were more inclined to enlist their spouses in helping them rule, which enabled them ultimately to pursue more aggressive war policies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707011

Politicians may thus seek to influence future policy choices, for example, by investing in green technologies that motivate later politicians to act sustainably. I show that optimal investment subsidies are larger for technologies that are strategic complements to future investments, that are further upstream in the supply chain, or that are characterized by longer maturity. Time inconsistency can rationalize subsidies at similar levels as market failures such as externalities can. Furthermore, the two are superadditive: time inconsistency and strategic investments are especially important for long-term policies associated with externalities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707024

We compare children who, at 3–4 years old, were randomized into either a full-time preschool, a parenting program, or a control group. We returned to the children when they reached 6–8 years of age and conducted a series of incentivized experiments to elicit their social preferences.

Such framing effects cast doubt on the welfare conclusions drawn from revealed-preference analysis. We relax the assumptions underlying that approach to accommodate settings in which framing effects are present. Plausible restrictions of varying strength permit either partial or point identification of preferences for the decision makers who choose consistently across frames. Recovering population preferences requires understanding the empirical relationship between decision makers’ preferences and their sensitivity to the frame.

In our model, this ratings heterogeneity can arise because supervisors can differ in their ability to manage subordinates or in their leniency when rating subordinates.

We estimate robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones. We also show that areas most exposed to robots after 1990 do not exhibit any differential trends before then, and robots’ impact is distinct from other capital and technologies.

In our model, consistent with the data, when a country experiences asset fire sales, foreign investments exit (fickleness), while domestic investments abroad return home (retrenchment). When countries have symmetric expected returns and financial development, the benefits of retrenchment dominate the costs of fickleness and gross flows increase fire-sale prices. Fickleness, however, creates a coordination problem since it encourages local policy makers to restrict capital inflows.

We show that the competitive conditions among sellers shape the market structure in platform industries. If product market competition is tough, sellers avoid competitors by joining different platforms. This allows platforms to sustain high fees and explains why, for example, in some online markets, several homogeneous platforms segment the market. Instead, if product market competition is soft, agglomeration on a single platform emerges, and platforms fight for the dominant position. These insights give rise to novel predictions. For instance, market concentration and fees are negatively correlated in platform industries, which inverts the standard logic of competition.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705720

To sharply identify motives, it develops strategic survey questions (SSQs) that elicit stated preferences.

Subjects in an experiment most commonly select the ex ante fair alternative ex ante and switch to the ex post fair alternative ex post. One potential explanation embraces consequentialism and construes reversals as time inconsistent. Another abandons consequentialism in favor of deontological (rule-based) ethics and thereby avoids the implication that revisions imply inconsistency.

We study this interaction in the context of Medicare’s prescription drug coverage program. We find that the observed mechanism is successful in keeping “raise-the-subsidy” incentives relatively low, acts much like a flat voucher, and obtains a level of welfare close to that for the optimal voucher. Across a range of counterfactuals, we find that more efficient subsidy mechanisms share three features: they retain the marginal elasticity of demand, limit the exercise of market power, and preserve the link between prices and marginal costs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/705550

We present a method to quantify the efficiency costs of constraints on externality-correcting policies or, more generally, the costs of imperfect pricing, using simple regression statistics. Under certain conditions, the R2 and the sum of squared residuals from a regression of true externalities on policy variables measure relative welfare gains from policies.

These results have significant implications: although often criticized as evidence of laxity or cronyism, muting competition (e.g., adopting softer grading curves or less high-powered promotion systems) can both reduce inequality and increase output. Holding promotion contests at the division level rather than the firm level can boost employees’ effort.

These effects are concentrated among hospitals previously paying relatively high prices for brands purchased in large volumes. Evidence from coronary stents suggests that transparency allows hospitals to resolve asymmetric information problems, but savings are limited in part by the stickiness of contracts in business-to-business settings.

A mediation analysis suggests that prosociality develops in response to prosocial role models and intense social interactions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704386
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Moving the Goalposts,Jeffrey C. Ely and Martin Szydlowski,"We study information as an incentive device in a dynamic moral hazard framework. An agent works on a task of uncertain difficulty, modeled as the duration of required effort. The principal knows the task difficulty and provides information over time. The optimal mechanism features moving goalposts: an initial disclosure makes the agent sufficiently optimistic that the task is easy. If the task is indeed difficult, the agent is told this only after working long enough to put the difficult task within reach. The agent then completes the difficult task even though he never would have chosen to at the outset.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704387
Journal of Political Economy,2020,"Political Booms, Financial Crises","Helios Herrera, Guillermo Ordonez and Christoph Trebesch","Political booms, measured by the rise in governments’ popularity, predict financial crises above and beyond better known early warning indicators, such as credit booms. This predictive power, however, only holds in emerging economies. We argue that governments in developing countries have stronger incentives to “ride” unsound credit booms in order to boost their popularity, rather than implementing corrective policies that could prevent crises but are politically costly. We provide evidence of the relevance of this mechanism, partly by constructing a new cross-country data set on government popularity based on opinion polls.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704544
Journal of Political Economy,2020,The Political Economy of Weak Treaties,Marco Battaglini and Bard Harstad,"In recent decades, democratic countries have negotiated hundreds of international treaties and agreements. This paper analyzes the equilibrium design of treaties negotiated by political incumbents seeking reelection. We show that incumbents are prone to negotiate treaties that are “weak,” in that they may or may not be complied with: this makes it possible to differentiate the alternative candidates in a way that favors the incumbent. We also show that political economy considerations lead to overambitious treaties that rely too much on technology instead of sanctions to motivate compliance. Our theory can rationalize several puzzles associated with treaties.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704610
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Bride Price and Female Education,"Nava Ashraf, Natalie Bau, Nathan Nunn and Alessandra Voena","We document an important consequence of bride price, a payment made by the groom to the bride’s family at marriage. Revisiting Indonesia’s school construction program, we find that among ethnic groups without the custom, it had no effect on girls’ schooling. Among ethnic groups with the custom, it had large positive effects. We show (theoretically and empirically) that this is because a daughter’s education, by increasing the amount of money parents receive at marriage, generates an additional incentive for parents to educate their daughters. We replicate these findings in Zambia, a country that had a similar large-scale school construction program.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704572
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Structural Estimation of a Model of School Choices: The Boston Mechanism versus Its Alternatives,"Caterina Calsamiglia, Chao Fu and Maia Güell","We model household choice of schools under the Boston mechanism (BM) and develop a new method, applicable to a broad class of mechanisms, to fully solve the choice problem even if it is infeasible via the traditional method. We estimate the joint distribution of household preferences and sophistication types, using administrative data from Barcelona. Counterfactual policy analyses show that a change from BM in Barcelona to the deferred-acceptance mechanism would decrease average welfare by €1,020, while a change to the top-trading-cycles mechanism would increase average welfare by €460.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704573
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Information Design in the Holdup Problem,Daniele Condorelli and Balázs Szentes,"We analyze a bilateral trade model where the buyer chooses the distribution of her valuation for the good. The seller, after observing the buyer’s distribution but not the realized valuation, makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer. If distributions are costless, the price and the payoffs of both the buyer and the seller are shown to be 1/e in the unique equilibrium outcome. The buyer’s equilibrium distribution generates a unit-elastic demand, and trade is ex post efficient. These properties are shown to be preserved even when different distributions are differentially costly as long as the cost is monotone in the dispersion of the distribution.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704574
Journal of Political Economy,2020,On the Optimality of Financial Repression,"V. V. Chari, Alessandro Dovis and Patrick Kehoe","When is financial repression—namely, policies that force banks to hold government debt—optimal? With commitment, such policies are never optimal because they crowd out banks’ productive investments. Without commitment, they are optimal when governments need to issue unusually large amounts of debt, such as during wartime. In such times, repression allows governments to credibly issue more debt. Repression increases credibility because when banks hold government debt, defaults dilute net worth, reduce investment, and are thus costly ex post. Forcing banks to hold debt endogenously increases these ex post costs but has ex ante costs because doing so crowds out investments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704575
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Like Attract Like? A Structural Comparison of Homogamy across Same-Sex and Different-Sex Households,"Edoardo Ciscato, Alfred Galichon and Marion Goussé","In this paper, we extend Gary Becker’s empirical analysis of the marriage market to same-sex couples. We build an equilibrium model of the same-sex marriage market that allows for straightforward identification of the gains of marriage. We estimate the model with 2008–12 American Community Survey data on California and find that positive assortative mating is weaker for same-sex couples than for different-sex couples with respect to age and race. Positive assortative mating on education is stronger among female same-sex couples but comparable for male same-sex and different-sex couples. As regards labor market outcomes, our results suggest that specialization within the household mainly applies to different-sex couples.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704611
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Clock Auctions and Radio Spectrum Reallocation,Paul Milgrom and Ilya Segal,"We study the class of multiround, multiproduct clock procurement auctions that reduce offered prices at each round. When prices stop declining, the remaining bidders become the winning sellers. For single-minded bidders, each such auction has five properties not shared by Vickrey auctions: each is obviously strategy-proof and group-strategy-proof, sets prices that are Nash equilibrium winning bids in the related first-price auction, preserves winner privacy about values, and can be extended to satisfy a budget constraint. In simulations of the US incentive auction, a heuristic clock auction from this class achieves quick computations, high efficiency, and low prices.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704074
Journal of Political Economy,2020,On the Origins of the State: Stationary Bandits and Taxation in Eastern Congo,Raúl Sánchez  de la Sierra,"A positive demand shock for coltan, a mineral whose bulky output cannot be concealed, leads armed actors to create illicit customs and provide protection at coltan mines, where they settle as “stationary bandits.” A similar shock for gold, easy to conceal, leads to stationary bandits in the villages where income from gold is spent, where they introduce illicit mining visas, taxes, and administrations. Having a stationary bandit from a militia or the Congolese army increases welfare. These findings suggest that armed actors may create “essential functions of a state” to better expropriate, which, depending on their goals, can increase welfare.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/703989
Journal of Political Economy,2020,The Role of Quality in Internet Service Markets,"Elena Krasnokutskaya, Kyungchul Song and Xun Tang","In online procurement markets, projects are often allocated through a mechanism that allows buyers to take into account a seller’s nonprice characteristics as well as his bid. We design a methodology to recover primitives of the environment in the presence of unobserved seller heterogeneity while accommodating two important features of such markets: buyer-specific choice sets and the high turnover of sellers. We apply our method to data from an online market for programming services, to assess buyers’ welfare gains associated with the globalization enabled by the internet. We find that the internet enables buyers to substantially improve on their outside (local) option; many of the gains arise from access to the international markets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/703990
Journal of Political Economy,2020,"Labor Supply in the Past, Present, and Future: A Balanced-Growth Perspective",Timo Boppart and Per Krusell,"The absence of a trend in hours worked in the postwar United States is an exception: across countries and historically, hours fall steadily by a little below 0.5% per year. Are steadily falling hours consistent with a stable utility function over consumption and leisure under balanced growth of the macroeconomic aggregates? Yes. We fully characterize the class of such functions and thus generalize the well-known “balanced-growth preferences” that demand constant (as opposed to falling) long-run hours. Key to falling hours is an income effect (of steady productivity growth on hours) that slightly outweighs the substitution effect.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704071
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Cognitive and Noncognitive Costs of Day Care at Age 0–2 for Children in Advantaged Families,"Margherita Fort, Andrea Ichino and Giulio Zanella","Exploiting admission thresholds to the Bologna day care system, we show using a regression discontinuity (RD) design that one additional day care month at age 0–2 reduces intelligence quotient by 0.5% (4.7% of a standard deviation) at age 8–14 in a relatively affluent population. The magnitude of this negative effect increases with family income. Similar negative impacts are found for personality traits. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis from psychology that children in day care experience fewer one-to-one interactions with adults, with negative effects in families where such interactions are of higher quality. We embed this hypothesis in a model that lends structure to our RD design.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704075
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Survival and Long-Run Dynamics with Heterogeneous Beliefs under Recursive Preferences,Jaroslav Borovička,"I analytically characterize the long-run behavior of an economy with two types of agents who differ in their beliefs and are endowed with homothetic recursive preferences. Agents with more incorrect beliefs dominate, or agents with different accuracy of their beliefs coexist in the long run, for broad ranges of plausible parameterizations when risk aversion is greater than the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. The results highlight a crucial interaction between risk sharing, speculative behavior and consumption-saving choice of agents with heterogeneous beliefs, and the role of equilibrium prices in shaping long-run outcomes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704072
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Social Insurance and the Marriage Market,Petra Persson,"Social insurance is often linked to marriage. Existing evidence suggests small marital responses to financial incentives and stems from settings where benefits are realized in the near future. I analyze how linking survivors insurance to marriage affects the marriage market. Exploiting Sweden’s elimination of survivors insurance, I demonstrate that severing this link (1) affected entry into marriage up to 50 years before expected payout, (2) raised the divorce rate by 10%, and (3) raised the assortativeness of matching. This suggests that marital behavior is a key component of couples’ strategies to plan for financial security in old age.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704073
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Internal versus External Growth in Industries with Scale Economies: A Computational Model of Optimal Merger Policy,"Ben Mermelstein, Volker Nocke, Mark A. Satterthwaite and Michael D. Whinston","We study merger policy in a dynamic computational model in which firms can reduce costs through investment or through mergers. Firms invest or propose mergers according to the profitability of these strategies. An antitrust authority can block mergers at some cost. We examine the optimal policy for an antitrust authority that cannot commit to its future policy and approves mergers as they are proposed. We find that the optimal policy can differ substantially from a policy based on static welfare. In general, antitrust policy can greatly affect firms’ investment behavior, and firms’ investment behavior can greatly affect the optimal antitrust policy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704069
Journal of Political Economy,2020,Comparing the Chosen: Selection Bias When Selection Is Competitive,Thomas Noe,"Consider a decision maker who selects between paired random draws from two unconditional distributions, always selecting the larger draw in the pair. When will the resulting selection-conditioned distributions be ordered by first-order stochastic or monotone likelihood ratio dominance? In various guises, this question arises in many economic contexts—tournaments, contests, auctions, cheap-talk games, announcement returns, qualitative choice models, and treatment effects under self-selection. This paper develops simple, applicable characterizations of the properties of unconditional distributions that result in dominance conditioned on selection and uses these characterizations to analyze a number of economic selection problems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/704076
