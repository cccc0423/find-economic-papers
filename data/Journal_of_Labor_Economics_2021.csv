Journal of Labor Economics,2021,The Economic Impact of a High National Minimum Wage: Evidence from the 1966 Fair Labor Standards Act,"Martha Bailey, John DiNardo and Bryan Stuart","This paper examines the short- and longer-term economic effects of the 1966 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which increased the national minimum wage to its highest level of the twentieth century and extended coverage to an additional 9.1 million workers. Exploiting differences in the “bite” of the minimum wage owing to regional variation in the standard of living and industry composition, this paper finds that the 1966 FLSA increased wages dramatically but reduced aggregate employment only modestly. However, some evidence shows that disemployment effects were significantly larger among African American men, 40% of whom earned below the new minimum wage.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712554
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Labor Market Institutions and the Distribution of Wages: The Role of Spillover Effects,"Nicole M. Fortin, Thomas Lemieux and Neil Lloyd",This paper examines the role of spillover effects of minimum wages and threat effects of unionization in changes in wage inequality in the United States between 1979 and 2017. A distribution regression framework is introduced to estimate both types of spillover effects. Threat effects double the contribution of deunionization to the increase in male wage inequality. Spillover effects magnify the explanatory power of declining minimum wages to two-thirds of the increase in inequality at the bottom end of the female wage distribution.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712923
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Pell Grants and Student Success: Evidence from the Universe of Federal Aid Recipients,Amanda Eng and Jordan Matsudaira,"The Federal Pell Grant Program lowers the cost of higher education for low-income students. We estimate Pell’s average effect for the universe of federally aided students—the broadest swath of higher education studied to date. Exploiting discontinuities and kinks in the grant schedule, we find that the effect of Pell on completion rates and postcollege earnings is much smaller than the findings of recent prominent studies focused on specific states. We argue that interactions between Pell grants and state aid programs may explain this difference, underscoring the importance of understanding how the impact of financial aid depends on context.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712556
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Are Sufficient Statistics Necessary? Nonparametric Measurement of Deadweight Loss from Unemployment Insurance,"David S. Lee, Pauline Leung, Christopher J. O’Leary, Zhuan Pei and Simon Quach","Central to the welfare analysis of income transfer programs is the deadweight loss associated with possible reforms. To aid analytical tractability, its measurement typically requires specifying a simplified model of behavior. We employ a complementary “decomposition” approach that compares the behavioral and mechanical components of a policy’s total impact on the government budget to study the deadweight loss of two unemployment insurance policies. Experimental and quasi-experimental estimates using state administrative data show that increasing the weekly benefit is more efficient (with a fiscal externality of 53 cents per dollar of mechanical transferred income) than reducing the program’s implicit earnings tax.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711594
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,A Practical Proactive Proposal for Dealing with Attrition: Alternative Approaches and an Empirical Example,"John DiNardo, Jordan Matsudaira, Justin McCrary and Lisa Sanbonmatsu","Survey nonresponse and attrition undermine the validity of many and possibly most econometric estimates. We propose that survey administrators and evaluators proactively create an instrument for observation, for example, by ex ante randomizing participants to differing intensity of follow-up. We illustrate how to apply our proposed methodology using a carefully conducted randomized controlled trial, the Moving to Opportunity demonstration project, which de facto randomly assigned a subset of subjects to more intensive follow-up. The approach yields treatment effect estimates similar to the unbiased estimator based on complete administrative data and has narrower confidence intervals than alternative bounding approaches.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712922
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,"Judge Effects, Case Characteristics, and Plea Bargaining","Kristin Butcher, Kyung H. Park and Anne Piehl","A growing literature uses random assignment of cases to judges to examine criminal sentencing. To extend this line of work, we directly examine how judicial “harshness” varies with the seriousness of criminal conviction. Using a model that respects the mix of cases and the noise produced by small caseloads, we find that case severity is best viewed as an endogenous outcome of bargaining. We also find that harsher judges have a higher share of cases failing to reach a plea bargain, but perhaps surprisingly, there is little evidence that large jumps in expected incarceration lead to differential plea bargain outcomes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712981
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Medicaid Expansion and the Unemployed,"Thomas C. Buchmueller, Helen Levy and Robert Valletta","We examine how a key provision of the Affordable Care Act—the expansion of Medicaid eligibility—affected health insurance coverage, access to care, and labor market transitions of unemployed workers. Comparing trends in states that implemented the Medicaid expansion to those that did not, we find that the expansion substantially increased insurance coverage and improved access to health care among unemployed workers. We then test whether the expansion affected transitions from unemployment to employment or out of the labor force. We find no meaningful statistical evidence in support of moral hazard effects that reduce job finding or labor force attachment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712478
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Observational Studies of the Effect of Medicaid on Health: Controls Are Not Enough,"Seth Freedman, Andrew Goodman-Bacon and Noah Hammarlund","Covariate-adjusted cross-sectional comparisons show that Medicaid patients have worse health outcomes than other patients. We evaluate the validity of this research design for estimating the causal effect of Medicaid on mortality. Even after controlling for common covariates, Medicaid patients have worse preoperative health and lower socioeconomic status than privately insured patients. Controlling for additional variables shrinks the mortality differences but still does not eliminate imbalance in other predetermined variables. These results can be explained by fairly weak assumptions about unmeasured confounders. We conclude that cross-sectional observational methods do not produce valid causal estimates of Medicaid’s mortality effects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712948
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,"Holiday, Just One Day out of Life: Birth Timing and Postnatal Outcomes","Mireille Jacobson, Maria Kogelnik and Heather Royer","Fewer births occur on major US holidays than would otherwise be expected. We use California data to study the nature and health implications of this birth date manipulation. We document 18% fewer births on the day of and just after a holiday. Cesarean sections account for roughly half of the decline. “Missing” holiday births are displaced to a window of time 11 days before the holiday through 16 days after the holiday. High-risk births are more likely to be rescheduled. Despite the change in timing, we find little evidence of any adverse health consequences for babies born around a holiday.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712493

Journal of Labor Economics,2021,The Use and Misuse of Income Data and Extreme Poverty in the United States,"Bruce D. Meyer, Derek Wu, Victoria Mooers and Carla Medalia","Recent research suggests that the share of US households living on less than $2/person/day is high and rising. We reexamine such extreme poverty by linking SIPP and CPS data to administrative tax and program data. We find that more than 90% of those reported to be in extreme poverty are not, once we include in-kind transfers, replace survey reports of earnings and transfer receipt with administrative records, and account for ownership of substantial assets. More than half of all misclassified households have incomes from the administrative data above the poverty line, and many have middle-class measures of material well-being.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711227
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Female Earnings Inequality: The Changing Role of Family Characteristics and Its Effect on the Extensive and Intensive Margins,David Card and Dean Hyslop,"Using data for three cohorts of women in the PSID, we show that annual earnings inequality fell sharply between the late 1960s and the mid-1990s, with a large decline in the component attributable to the extensive margin. We then fit earnings-generating models that incorporate both intensive- and extensive-margin dynamics to data for the three cohorts. Our models suggest that more than 80% of the decline in female earnings inequality can be attributed to a weakening of the link between family-based factors (i.e., children and the presence and incomes of partners) and the intensive and extensive margins of earnings determination.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711368
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Dropouts Need Not Apply? The Minimum Wage and Skill Upgrading,"Jeffrey Clemens, Lisa B. Kahn and Jonathan Meer","We explore whether minimum wage increases result in substitution from lower-skilled to slightly higher-skilled labor. Using 2011–16 American Community Survey (ACS) data, we show that workers employed in low-wage occupations are older and more likely to have a high school diploma following recent statutory minimum wage increases. To better understand the role of firms, we examine the Burning Glass vacancy data. We find increases in a high school diploma requirement following minimum wage hikes, consistent with our ACS evidence on stocks of employed workers. We see substantial adjustments to requirements both within and across firms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711490
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,School Segregation and Racial Gaps in Special Education Identification,"Todd Elder, David Figlio, Scott Imberman and Claudia Persico","We use linked birth and education records from Florida to investigate how the identification of childhood disabilities varies by race and school racial composition. Using a series of decompositions, we find that black and Hispanic students are identified with disabilities at lower rates than are observationally similar white students. Black and Hispanic students are overidentified in schools with relatively small shares of minorities and substantially underidentified in schools with large minority shares. Our results are consistent with a heightened awareness among school officials of disabilities in students who are racially and ethnically distinct from the majority race in the school.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711421
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,The Employment Impact of the Provision of Public Health Insurance: A Further Examination of the Effect of the 2005 TennCare Contraction,John Ham and Ken Ueda,"In a 2014 paper, Garthwaite, Gross, and Notowidigdo examined the employment impact of the 2005 TennCare contraction. We extend their approach in several directions. First, we use consistent Conley-Taber estimation. Second, we transform their estimates to make them comparable to previous work; the transformed effects have large confidence intervals. We estimate their models using several larger data sets in an attempt to get more precise estimates but find that the results can be quite different. We consider two modifications to account for a major disruption to coverage in 2002, and one of these reduces the differences in the results.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711560
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,The Cobb-Douglas Marriage Matching Function: Marriage Matching with Peer and Scale Effects,Ismael Mourifié and Aloysius Siow,"Across states, there is little correlation between a state’s marriage rate or cohabitation rate and own population. Within states, there is a positive (no) correlation between a state’s marriage (cohabitation) rate and its population growth rate. The Cobb-Douglas marriage matching function (CDMMF), which extends the Choo-Siow MMF to include peer effects, can rationalize these correlations. The model is easy to estimate. The CDMMF is estimated using panel data across US states from 1990 to 2010. The estimated model replicates the above scale effects. These effects are not sufficient to explain the large recent declines in the gains to marriage.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711491
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,"Wages, Experience, and Training of Women over the Life Cycle","Richard Blundell, Monica Costa-Dias, David Goll and Costas Meghir","We investigate the role of training in reducing the gender wage gap using the British Household Panel Survey. On the basis of a life-cycle model and using tax and welfare benefit reforms as a source of exogenous variation, we evaluate the role of formal training and experience in defining the evolution of wages and employment careers, conditional on education. Training is potentially important in compensating for the effects of children, especially for women who left education after completing high school, but does not fundamentally change the wage gap resulting from labor market interruptions following child birth.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711400
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Reconciling Survey and Administrative Measures of Self-Employment,"Katharine Abraham, John Haltiwanger, Claire Hou, Kristin Sandusky and James R. Spletzer",Good information on self-employment is needed to inform the ongoing discussion of the rise of the gig economy and its implications for workers. Tax data show significant growth in self-employment not captured in the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS-ASEC). The growing gap reflects both self-employment in tax data missing from the CPS-ASEC and self-employment misreported as wage and salary work. We document consistent patterns in the discrepancies between the tax and survey data but are able to explain only a modest share of the growing disagreement between them.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712187
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,The Surprising Impacts of Unionization: Evidence from Matched Employer-Employee Data,Brigham R. Frandsen,"This study presents new evidence on the impacts of unionization using administrative data matching workers to employers in a regression discontinuity design. Close union elections exhibit substantial nonrandom selection or manipulation. Estimates accounting for this selection show that unionization substantially decreases payroll, employment, average worker earnings, and establishment survival. Payroll and earnings decreases are driven by composition changes, with older and higher-paid workers leaving unionizing establishments and younger workers joining or staying. Worker-level effects on earnings are small and are reconciled with large negative establishment-level effects in a model of employer and employee selection into union jobs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711852
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Tots and Teens: How Does Child’s Age Influence Maternal Labor Supply and Child Care Response to the Earned Income Tax Credit?,Katherine Michelmore and Natasha Pilkauskas,"Building on earlier work that shows that the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has a substantial positive effect on maternal labor supply, we show that labor supply effects are concentrated among mothers with children under age 3, with only moderate effects of the EITC on the labor supply of mothers with teenagers. These increases in labor supply are coupled with large increases in the use and cost of child care among mothers with children under age 3. Results highlight the importance of considering heterogeneous treatment effects of policy and have implications for child care policy and other family policy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711383
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Changes across Cohorts in Wage Returns to Schooling and Early Work Experiences,"Jared Ashworth, V. Joseph Hotz, Arnaud Maurel and Tyler Ransom","This paper investigates the wage returns to schooling and actual early work experiences and how these returns have changed over the past 20 years. Using the NLSY surveys, we develop and estimate a dynamic model of the joint schooling and work decisions that young men make in early adulthood and quantify how they affect wages using a generalized Mincerian specification. Our results highlight the need to account for dynamic selection and changes in composition when analyzing changes in wage returns. In particular, we find that ignoring the selectivity of accumulated work experiences results in overstatement of the returns to education.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711851
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Improving Educational Pathways to Social Mobility: Evidence from Norway’s Reform 94,"Marianne Bertrand, Magne Mogstad and Jack Mountjoy","We study the impacts of a major reform to vocational secondary education that aimed to move beyond the trade-off between providing occupational skills and closing off academic opportunities. Norway’s Reform 94 integrated more general education into the vocational track, offered vocational students a pathway to college, and increased access to apprenticeships. We identify reform impacts through a difference-in-discontinuity research design applied to linked population registries. The reform substantially increased initial vocational enrollment, but with divergent consequences by gender. Overall, the reform succeeded at improving social mobility, particularly for disadvantaged men, but it somewhat exacerbated the gender gap in adult earnings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713009
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Personnel Practices and Regulation: How Firm-Provided Incentives Respond to Changes in Mandatory Retirement Law,Anders Frederiksen and Colleen Flaherty Manchester,"We study how firms’ personnel practices react to labor market regulation. While a company is compelled to comply with a new law, what is the ripple effect of the change on existing personnel policies and practices? We provide evidence using passage of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and nearly two decades of administrative data from a large US firm. In line with theory, we find a weakening of long-term implicit incentives and movement toward pay for performance. Furthermore, the data are consistent with the firm carefully managing its personnel practices according to economic principles to preserve incentives for employees.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712610
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Investment over the Business Cycle: Insights from College Major Choice,"Erica Blom, Brian Cadena and Benjamin Keys","How does personal exposure to economic conditions affect individual human capital investment choices? Focusing on bachelor’s degree recipients, we find that cohorts exposed to higher unemployment rates during typical schooling years select majors that earn higher wages, have better employment prospects, and lead to work in a related field. Conditional on expected earnings, recessions also encourage women to enter male-dominated fields, and students of both genders pursue more difficult majors. We conclude that economic environments change how students select majors, and we find evidence that students who respond to the business cycle enjoy earnings typical of their new majors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712611
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Moving to Jobs: The Role of Information in Migration Decisions,Riley Wilson,"This paper exploits county-level variation in exposure to news about labor markets impacted by fracking to show that access to information about employment opportunities affects migration. Exposure to newspaper articles about fracking increased migration to areas mentioned in the news by 2.4% on average, concentrated among young, unmarried, less educated men. Commuting also increased, sentiment of the news matters, and TV news has an impact. Google searches for “fracking” and names of states specifically mentioned spike after news broadcasts about fracking. Counties experiencing weak labor markets are the most responsive, suggesting that these areas see large benefits to information provision.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713008
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Community College Program Choices in the Wake of Local Job Losses,Riley Acton,"Deciding which field to study is one of the most consequential decisions college students make, but most research on the topic focuses on students attending 4-year colleges. To understand how students attending community colleges make field-of-study decisions, I link administrative educational records of recent high school graduates with local mass layoff and plant-closing announcements. I find that declines in local employment deter students from entering closely related community college programs and instead induce them to enroll in other vocationally oriented programs. Students predominantly shift enrollment between programs that lead to occupations requiring similar skills.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712555
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Teacher Peer Observation and Student Test Scores: Evidence from a Field Experiment in English Secondary Schools,"Simon Burgess, Shenila Rawal and Eric S. Taylor","This paper reports on a field experiment in 82 high schools trialing a low-cost intervention in schools’ operations: teachers working in the same school observed and scored each other’s teaching. Students in treatment schools scored 0.07 student standard deviations higher on math and English exams. Teachers were further randomly assigned to roles—observer and observee—and students of both types benefited, observers’ students perhaps more so. Doubling the number of observations produced no difference in student outcomes. Treatment effects were larger for otherwise low-performing teachers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712997
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,"Do Grandparents Matter? Multigenerational Mobility in the United States, 1940–2015","Joseph Ferrie, Catherine Massey and Jonathan Rothbaum","We assess the biases induced by measurement error in a study of correlations in educational attainment across two and three generations in the United States using linked data spanning 1940–2015. Although multigenerational regressions show an economically meaningful “grandparent effect,” we find that this effect is overstated and likely not statistically or economically significant after we correct for measurement error. However, that same measurement error means that inferences derived using only two generations of data understate persistence in educational attainment by roughly 20%. We find an 18% decline in the intergenerational correlation of educational attainment over the twentieth century.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711038
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,"US Permanent Residency, Job Mobility, and Earnings",Xuening Wang,"One concern regarding US immigration policies is that skilled workers on temporary visas may be bound to their employers in “indentured servitude,” giving rise to monopsony power. I investigate this concern by estimating the effect of acquiring permanent residency on the job mobility and earnings of these workers. Using fixed effects models, I find an immediate upsurge in mobility upon permanent residency receipt, primarily driven by voluntary moving being depressed during the employer-sponsored immigration process. Job lock reduces the earnings of male workers by 4.7%, which translates to a 2% surplus for firms after extra hiring costs are subtracted.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/709689
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,"State Minimum Wages, Employment, and Wage Spillovers: Evidence from Administrative Payroll Data","Radhakrishnan Gopalan, Barton H. Hamilton, Ankit Kalda and David Sovich","We use administrative payroll data to estimate the effect of the minimum wage on employment and wages. We find that both effects are nuanced. While the overall number of low-wage workers in firms declines, incumbent workers are no less likely to remain employed. We find that firms reduce employment primarily through hiring, and there is significant heterogeneity across the nontradable and tradable sectors. For wages, we find modest spillovers extending up to $2.50 above the minimum wage. Spillovers accrue to both incumbent workers and new hires, but only within firms that employ a significant fraction of low-wage workers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711355
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Do Workers Value Flexible Jobs? A Field Experiment,"Haoran He, David Neumark and Qian Weng","We explore workers’ valuation of job flexibility using a field experiment conducted on a Chinese job board. Our experimental job ads differ randomly in offering jobs that are flexible regarding when (time flexibility) or where (place flexibility) one works and in offering different salaries. Application rates are higher for flexible jobs conditional on the salary offered, providing evidence that workers value job flexibility. Moreover, under some plausible conditions our evidence is informative about job seekers’ willingness to pay for flexible jobs of the types offered in the experiment and points to fairly high valuation of the most flexible jobs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711226
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Contagious Animosity in the Field: Evidence from the Federal Criminal Justice System,Brendon McConnell and Imran Rasul,"We investigate whether increased animosity toward Muslims after 9/11 had spillover effects on Black and Hispanic individuals in the federal criminal justice system. Using linked administrative data tracking defendants from arrest through sentencing, we find that after 9/11, sentence and presentence outcomes for Hispanic defendants significantly worsened. Outcomes for Black defendants were unchanged. The findings are consistent with judges and prosecutors displaying social preferences characterized by contagious animosity from Muslims to Hispanics. Our findings provide among the first field evidence of contagious animosity, indicating that social preferences across out-groups are interlinked and malleable.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711180
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Violence and Human Capital Investments,Martin Foureaux Koppensteiner and Livia Menezes,"We combine extremely granular information on the location and timing of homicides with a number of large administrative educational data sets from Brazil to estimate the effect of exposure to homicides around schools, around students’ residences, and on their way to school. We show that violence has a detrimental effect on both school attendance and standardized test scores and that it increases the dropout rates of students substantially. We use exceptionally rich information from student- and parent-background questionnaires to investigate the effect of violence on aspirations and attitudes toward education. We find that boys systematically report lower educational aspiration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711001
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,The Labor Market Returns to Advanced Degrees,Joseph Altonji and Ling Zhong,"We estimate the returns to a broad set of graduate degrees. To control for heterogeneity in preferences and ability, we use fixed effects for combinations of field-specific undergraduate and graduate degrees obtained by the last time we observe an individual. Basically, we compare earnings before the graduate degree to earnings after it. Using National Science Foundation data, we find large differences across graduate fields in earnings effects. The returns often depend on the undergraduate major. The contribution of occupational upgrading to the earnings gain varies across degrees. Finally, simple regression-based estimates of returns to graduate fields are often highly misleading.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710959
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Estimating the Value of Higher Education Financial Aid: Evidence from a Field Experiment,"Christian Belzil, Arnaud Maurel and Modibo Sidibé","Using data from a Canadian field experiment on financial barriers to higher education, we estimate the distribution of the value of financial aid for prospective students. We find that a considerable share of prospective students perceive significant credit constraints. Most individuals are willing to pay a sizable interest premium above the prevailing market rate for the option to take up a loan, with a median interest rate wedge equal to 6.8 percentage points for a $1,000 loan. The willingness to pay for financial aid is heterogeneous across students, with discount factors playing a key role in accounting for this variation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710701
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Why Is Math Cheaper than English? Understanding Cost Differences in Higher Education,"Steven W. Hemelt, Kevin Stange, Fernando Furquim, Andrew Simon and John E. Sawyer","This paper establishes five new facts about instructional costs in higher education using department-level data from a broad range of institutions. Costs vary widely across fields, ranging from electrical engineering (90% higher than English) to math (25% lower). This pattern is largely explained by differences in class size and faculty pay. Some STEM fields experienced steep declines in expenditures over the past 17 years, while others saw increases. Changes in class size and teaching loads alongside a shift toward contingent faculty explain these trends. Finally, the association between online instruction and instructional costs is statistically indistinguishable from zero.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/709535
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Labor Market Quotas When Promotions Are Signals,"Suzanne H. Bijkerk, Silvia Dominguez-Martinez, Jurjen Kamphorst and Otto H. Swank","We analyze the consequences of labor market quotas for the wages of women in high-level positions. Labor market quotas create uncertainty about the reason a woman is promoted. Firms know whether they promoted female employees because of the quota or their ability; their competitors do not. A winner’s curse, reducing competition for women in high-level positions, results. This widens the gender pay gap for these women. Ex ante, women are better off without quotas. Next we investigate how quotas affect incentives for employers to learn women’s abilities to make better job assignment decisions. Then, under specific conditions women may benefit.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710358
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,How Costly Is Turnover? Evidence from Retail,Peter Kuhn and Lizi Yu,"We estimate turnover costs in small retail sales teams using daily sales data and an advance notice requirement to address endogeneity concerns. In addition to short-staffing and onboarding costs, we identify two less familiar sources of turnover costs: incumbent workers’ recruitment activities and reductions in team morale after a departure is announced. Our estimates of total turnover costs are relatively modest, however: 10% higher turnover is about as costly as a 0.6% wage increase. We attribute these low costs to a set of complementary personnel policies that ensure that only 25% of departures result in a short-staffing spell.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710359
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Occupational Recognition and Immigrant Labor Market Outcomes,"Herbert Brücker, Albrecht Glitz, Adrian Lerche and Agnese Romiti","We analyze how the formal recognition of foreign qualifications affects immigrants’ labor market outcomes. The empirical analysis is based on a novel German data set that links respondents’ survey information to their administrative records, allowing us to observe immigrants at monthly intervals before, during, and after their application for occupational recognition. We find that 3 years after obtaining recognition, immigrants earn 19.8% higher wages and are 24.5 percentage points more likely to be employed than immigrants in the control group. We further document that occupational recognition leads to full convergence of immigrants’ earnings to those of their native counterparts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710702
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Estimating the Effect of School Quality on Mortality in the Presence of Migration: Evidence from the Jim Crow South,"Daniel Aaronson, Bhashkar Mazumder, Seth G. Sanders and Evan Taylor","How does school quality affect health amid multiple behavioral responses? The Rosenwald schools transformed school quality for rural southern African Americans in the early 1900s. Research shows that the schools made black migration northward more likely and that the Great Migration shortened life expectancy for these migrants. Besides the hypothesized health-enhancing effects of school quality, negative health effects might also occur through migration. We disentangle behavioral mechanisms and find complete exposure to the Rosenwald schools increased life expectancy by 2–3 months; a more naive approach finds no relationship. Results are robust to heterogeneous treatment effects and various measurement issues.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/709783
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,How Cognitive Ability and Personality Traits Affect Geographic Mobility,Aline Bütikofer and Giovanni Peri,"Noncognitive characteristics and personality traits can be strong predictors of economic and social outcomes of individuals. In this paper, using data on cognitive ability and psychologist-assessed “sociability” and “adaptability” linked to administrative data for the male 1932–33 birth cohort in Norway, we analyze how these three characteristics affect men’s probability to migrate across labor markets. We find that higher adaptability, the capacity to adjust to new environments and situations, and higher cognitive ability are significant predictors of the probability to migrate. Adaptability is a particularly strong migration predictor for individuals with low cognitive ability or low socioeconomic background.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710189
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Better Together? Social Networks in Truancy and the Targeting of Treatment,Magdalena Bennett and Peter Bergman,"There is concern that the risky behaviors of teenagers, such as truancy, negatively influence the behaviors of others through their social networks. We use administrative data to construct social networks based on students who are truant together. We simulate these networks to document that certain students systematically coordinate their absences. We validate them by showing that a parent information intervention on student absences has spillover effects from treated students onto their peers. Excluding these effects understates the intervention’s cost-effectiveness by 43%. We show that there is potential to use networks to target interventions more efficiently given a budget constraint.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708672
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Immigrant Earnings Assimilation in the United States: A Panel Analysis,Deborah Rho and Seth Sanders,"We construct the first long-term comparison of cross-sectional and panel estimates of immigrant earnings assimilation in the United States from a single data source. Unlike previous results, we find that selective out-migration of higher-earning immigrants biases downward cross-sectional estimates for all education groups. Cross-sectional estimates dramatically understate earnings growth for high-skilled foreign-born workers. The bias stems from both selective out-migration and selective employment; among high-skilled immigrants, low earners find employment with a substantial delay, while high earners work immediately on arrival. We present suggestive evidence that the H-1B visa program may play a role in estimated immigrant earnings dynamics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708615
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Does Banning the Box Help Ex-Offenders Get Jobs? Evaluating the Effects of a Prominent Example,Evan K. Rose,"This paper uses administrative employment and conviction data to evaluate laws that restrict access to job seekers’ criminal records. Convictions generate decreases in employment and earnings, partly due to shifts toward lower-paying industries less likely to check criminal histories. However, a 2013 Seattle law barring employers from examining job seekers’ records until after an initial screening had negligible impacts on ex-offenders’ labor market outcomes. The results are consistent with employers deferring background checks until later in the interview process or ex-offenders applying only to jobs where clean records are not required, a pattern supported by survey evidence.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708063
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Why Are Some Immigrant Groups More Successful Than Others?,Edward P. Lazear,"The composition of immigrants depends not only on immigrant choice but also on immigration policy, because slots are rationed. Policy determines immigrant attainment, as evidenced by immigrants from Algeria having higher educational attainment than those from Israel or Japan. Theory predicts and evidence confirms that immigrant attainment is inversely related to the number admitted from a source country and positively related to population and education levels at home. A parsimonious specification has only two variables yet explains a majority of the variation in educational attainment of US immigrant groups. The theory and predictions are bolstered by Swedish data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/706900
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Learning Entrepreneurship from Other Entrepreneurs?,"Luigi Guiso, Luigi Pistaferri and Fabiano Schivardi","We document that individuals who grow up in high firm density areas are more likely to become entrepreneurs, given firm density in their current location, and to run businesses in the sector with the highest density when young. Firm density at an entrepreneur’s young age drives current firm profitability and is more important than current density for business performance. Results hold in a sample of movers, which allows addressing endogeneity concerns. These results are consistent with entrepreneurial skills being partly learnable through social contacts. Accordingly, entrepreneurs who grow up in high firm density areas adopt better managerial practices.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708445
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,How Do Employers Use Compensation History? Evidence from a Field Experiment,Moshe A. Barach and John J. Horton,"We report the results of a field experiment in which treated employers could not observe the compensation history of their job applicants. Treated employers responded by evaluating more applicants and evaluating those applicants more intensively. They also responded by changing what kind of workers they evaluated: treated employers evaluated workers with 5% lower past average wages and hired workers with 13% lower past average wages. Conditional on bargaining, workers hired by treated employers struck better wage bargains for themselves.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/709277
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Changing College Choices with Personalized Admissions Information at Scale: Evidence on Naviance,Christine Mulhern,"Choosing where to apply to college is a complex problem with long-term consequences, but many students lack the guidance necessary to make optimal choices. I show that a technology that provides low-cost personalized college admissions information to more than 40% of high schoolers significantly alters college choices. Students shift applications and attendance to colleges for which they can observe information on schoolmates’ admissions experiences. Responses are largest when such information suggests a high admissions probability. Disadvantaged students respond the most, and information on in-state colleges increases their 4-year college attendance. Data features and framing, however, deter students from selective colleges.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/708839
Journal of Labor Economics,2021,Adjusting to Globalization in Germany,"Wolfgang Dauth, Sebastian Findeisen and Jens Suedekum","We study the impact of trade exposure on the job biographies of 2.4 million manufacturing workers in Germany. Rising export opportunities lead to two equally important sources of earnings gains: on the job and employer switches within the same industry. Highly skilled workers benefit the most. Import shocks mostly hurt low-skilled workers, especially when they possess lots of industry-specific human capital. They also destroy workers’ rents when separating from high-wage plants, and they leave strongly scarring effects in the event of a mass layoff. We connect our results to the growing theoretical literature on the labor market effects of trade.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707356
