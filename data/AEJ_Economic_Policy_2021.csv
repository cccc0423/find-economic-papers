AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Internet as a Tax Haven?,David Agrawal,"If online transactions are tax free, increased online shopping may lower tax rates as jurisdictions seek to reduce tax avoidance; but, if online firms remit taxes, online sales may put upward pressure on tax rates because internet sales help enforce destination-based taxes. I find that higher internet penetration generally results in lower municipal tax rates but raises tax rates in some jurisdictions. The latter effect emerges in states where many online vendors remit taxes. A 1 standard deviation increase in internet penetration lowers local sales taxes in large municipalities by 0.15 percentage points, or 16 percent of the average rate.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170094
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Corporate Taxation under Weak Enforcement,Pierre Bachas and Mauricio Soto,"How should developing countries tax corporate income? We study this question in Costa Rica, where firms face higher average tax rates on profits when revenues marginally increase. We combine discontinuity and bunching designs to estimate the elasticity of taxable profit and separate it into revenue and cost elasticities. We find that firms faced with a higher tax rate slightly reduce revenues but considerably increase costs, thus producing a large elasticity of taxable profit of 3–5. In this context, the revenue-maximizing rate for a corporate tax on profit is below 25 percent, and we show that a tax policy that broadens the base while lowering the rate can almost double the tax revenue collected from these firms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180564
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Long-Run Impacts of Special Education,Briana Ballis and Katelyn Heath,"Over 13 percent of US students participate in special education (SE) programs annually, at a cost of $40 billion. However, due to selection issues the effect of SE placements remains unclear. This paper uses administrative data from Texas to examine the long-run effect of reducing SE access. Our research design exploits variation in SE placement driven by a unique state policy that required school districts to reduce SE caseloads to 8.5 percent. This policy led to sharp reductions in SE enrollment. These reductions generated significant reductions in educational attainment, suggesting that marginal participants experience long-run benefits from SE services.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190603
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,"Local Protectionism, Market Structure, and Social Welfare: China's Automobile Market","Panle Barwick, Shengmao Cao and Shanjun Li","This study documents the presence of local protectionism and quantifies its impacts on market competition and social welfare in the context of China's automobile market. A salient feature of China's auto market is that vehicle models by joint ventures and state-owned enterprises command much higher market shares in their headquarter provinces than at the national level. Through county border analysis, falsification tests, and a consumer survey, we uncover protectionist policies such as subsidies to local brands as the primary contributing factor to the observed home bias. We then set up and estimate a market equilibrium model to quantify the impact of local protection, controlling for other demand and supply factors. Counterfactual analysis shows that local protection leads to significant consumer choice distortions and results in 21.9 billion yuan of consumer welfare loss, amounting to 41 percent of total subsidy. Provincial governments face a prisoner's dilemma: local protection reduces aggregate social welfare, but provincial governments have no incentive to unilaterally remove local protection.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180513
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Subsidizing Fuel-Efficient Cars: Evidence from China's Automobile Industry,"Chia-Wen Chen, Wei-Min Hu and Christopher R. Knittel","This paper examines the response of vehicle purchase behavior to China's largest national subsidy program for fuel-efficient vehicles during 2010 and 2011. Using variation from the program's eligibility cutoffs and the rollout of the subsidy program, the program is found to boost sales for subsidized vehicle models, but also to create a substitution effect within highly fuel-efficient vehicles. Estimates imply that ignoring the substitution effect would lead one to conclude that the program is welfare enhancing, whereas in fact the marginal cost of the program exceeds the marginal benefit by as much as 300 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170098
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Collaborative Tax Evasion in the Provision of Services to Consumers: A Field Experiment,Annabelle Doerr and Sarah Necker,"We conduct a field experiment with sellers of home improvement services on two German online markets. We take the role of consumers and vary whether we request an invoice for the delivery of the service. In a market that allows anyone to sell anonymously, a willingness to evade is prevalent. In a market that keeps track of credentials, sellers are only willing to evade when a willingness to collude is signaled. The evasion discount is in most estimates not larger than the tax subsidy for legal demand. Evasion is unlikely to be beneficial for many consumers in our setting.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190675
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Democracy and Aid Donorship,Angelika J. Budjan and Andreas Fuchs,"Almost half of the world's states provide bilateral development assistance. While previous research takes the set of donor countries as exogenous, this article introduces a new dataset on aid giving that covers all countries in the world, both rich and poor, and explores the determinants of aid donorship. It argues and shows empirically that democratic institutions support the setup of an aid program in richer countries but undermine its establishment in poorer countries. The findings hold in instrumental-variable regressions and the pattern is similar for the amount of aid.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180582
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Disclosure and Subsequent Innovation: Evidence from the Patent Depository Library Program,"Jeffrey L. Furman, Markus Nagler and Martin Watzinger","How important is access to patent documents for subsequent innovation? We examine the expansion of the USPTO Patent Library system after 1975. Patent libraries provided access to patents before the Internet. We find that after patent library opening, local patenting increases by 8–20 percent relative to similar regions. Additional analyses suggest that disclosure of technical information drives this effect: inventors increasingly take up ideas from outside their region, and the effect is strongest in technologies where patents are more informative. We thus provide evidence that disclosure plays an important role in cumulative innovation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180636
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Program Recertification Costs: Evidence from SNAP,Tatiana Homonoff and Jason Somerville,"Participants in means-tested programs must periodically document eligibility through a recertification process. If all cases that fail recertification are ineligible, the exact timing of this process should be irrelevant. We find that later recertification interview assignments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which leave less time to reschedule missed interviews, decrease recertification success by 22 percent. The consequences of not recertifying due to later interviews are highly skewed: most cases quickly reenroll, while one-quarter remain off SNAP for over a year. The marginal disenrolled case is as needy as the average participant, suggesting inefficient screening from late interviews.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190272
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Why Are Relatively Poor People Not More Supportive of Redistribution? Evidence from a Randomized Survey Experiment across Ten Countries,Christopher Hoy and Franziska Mager,"We test a key assumption underlying seminal theories about preferences for redistribution, which is that relatively poor people should be the most in favor of redistribution. We conduct a randomized survey experiment with over 30,000 participants across 10 countries, half of whom are informed of their position in the national income distribution. Contrary to prevailing wisdom, people who are told they are relatively poorer than they thought are less concerned about inequality and are not more supportive of redistribution. This finding is consistent with people using their own living standard as a ""benchmark"" for what they consider acceptable for others.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190276
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Market Power and Income Taxation,Louis Kaplow,"This article analyzes concerns about market power and inequality in a model with multiple sectors, heterogeneous abilities, endogenous labor supply, and nonlinear income taxation. Proportional markups with no profit dissipation have no effect on the economy, and a policy that reduces a nonproportional markup raises (lowers) welfare when it is higher (lower) than a weighted average of other markups. With proportional (partial or full) profit dissipation, proportional markups are equivalent to a downward shift of the distribution of abilities, and the optimal policy rule with nonproportional markups maximizes consumer plus producer surplus despite concerns for distribution and labor supply distortion.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200103
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,"The Effects of the 1930s HOLC ""Redlining"" Maps","Daniel Aaronson, Daniel Hartley and Bhashkar Mazumder","This study uses a boundary design and propensity score methods to study the effects of the 1930s-era Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) ""redlining"" maps on the long-run trajectories of urban neighborhoods. The maps led to reduced home ownership rates, house values, and rents and increased racial segregation in later decades. A comparison on either side of a city-level population cutoff that determined whether maps were drawn finds broadly similar conclusions. These results suggest the HOLC maps had meaningful and lasting effects on the development of urban neighborhoods through reduced credit access and subsequent disinvestment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190414
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Network Externality and Subsidy Structure in Two-Sided Markets: Evidence from Electric Vehicle Incentives,Katalin Springel,"This paper uses new, large-scale vehicle registry data from Norway and a two-sided market framework to show nonneutrality of different subsidies and estimate their impact on electric vehicle adoption when network externalities are present. Estimates suggest a strong positive connection between electric vehicle purchases and both consumer price and charging station subsidies. Counterfactual analyses suggest that between 2010 and 2015, every dollar spent on station subsidies resulted in more than twice as many additional electric vehicle purchases than the same amount spent on price subsidies. However, this relation inverts with increased spending, as station subsidies' impact tapers off faster.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190131
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Fiscal Transfers in the Spatial Economy,"Marcel Henkel, Tobias Seidel and Jens Suedekum","Many countries shift substantial public resources across jurisdictions to mitigate spatial economic disparities. We use a general equilibrium model with multiple asymmetric regions, labor mobility, and costly trade to carve out the aggregate implications of fiscal transfers. Calibrating the model for Germany, we find that transfers indeed deliver smaller disparities across regions. This comes at the cost of lower national output, however, because economic activity is diverted away from core cities and toward remote areas with low productivity. But despite this loss in output per capita by about 2 percent in our baseline specification, welfare still increases by 0.07 percent because the transfer scheme countervails overcongestion in large cities. If the optimal transfer regime was implemented, welfare would increase by 0.06 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180294
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Do Value-Added Taxes Affect International Trade Flows? Evidence from 30 Years of Tax Reforms,Youssef Benzarti and Alisa Tazhitdinova,"This paper uses all value-added tax (VAT) changes across EU Member States from 1988 to 2016 to estimate the effect of VATs on trade flows. We find small elasticities of trade flows with respect to VATs, even when VAT changes are large. These elasticities are substantially smaller than the elasticities of trade flows with respect to tariffs estimated in the trade literature. This finding holds across different time periods, countries, and types of reforms. Our results imply that VATs are unlikely to distort trade flows.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190492
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Urban Water Disinfection and Mortality Decline in Lower-Income Countries,"Sonia Bhalotra, Alberto Diaz-Cayeros, Grant Miller, Alfonso Miranda and Atheendar S. Venkataramani","Historically, improvements in municipal water quality led to substantial mortality decline in today's wealthy countries. However, water disinfection has not consistently produced large benefits in lower-income countries. We study this issue by analyzing a large-scale municipal water disinfection program in Mexico that increased water chlorination coverage in urban areas from 58 percent to over 90 percent within 18 months. We estimate that the program reduced childhood diarrheal disease mortality rates by 45 to 67 percent. However, inadequate sanitation infrastructure and age (degradation) of water pipes may have attenuated these benefits substantially.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180764
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Deterring Illegal Entry: Migrant Sanctions and Recidivism in Border Apprehensions,"Samuel Bazzi, Gordon Hanson, Sarah John, Bryan Roberts and John Whitley","During the 2008 to 2012 period, the US Border Patrol enacted new sanctions on migrants apprehended while attempting to enter the United States illegally. Using administrative records on apprehensions of Mexican nationals that include fingerprint-based IDs and other details, we detect if an apprehended migrant is subject to penalties and if he is later reapprehended. Exploiting plausibly random variation in the rollout of sanctions, we estimate econometrically that exposure to penalties reduced the 18-month reapprehension rate for males by 4.6 to 6.1 percentage points off of a baseline rate of 24.2 percent. These magnitudes imply that sanctions can account for 28 to 44 percent of the observed decline in recidivism in apprehensions. Further results suggest that the drop in recidivism was associated with a reduction in attempted illegal entry.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190291
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Using Labor Supply Elasticities to Learn about Income Inequality: The Role of Productivities versus Preferences,Katy Bergstrom and William Dodds,"Using a general labor supply model in which individuals choose how much to work conditional on productivities and preferences for consumption relative to leisure, we show that the mapping from earnings and hours worked to productivities and preferences can be expressed entirely in terms of reduced-form labor supply elasticities. We investigate the roles that productivities and preferences play in driving income inequality in the United States. Benchmark labor supply elasticity estimates from the literature imply that productivities drive most income inequality. Preferences become increasingly important relative to benchmark, with larger income effects or larger differences between earnings and hours-worked elasticities.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200100
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Labor Market for Teachers under Different Pay Schemes,Barbara Biasi,"Compensation of most US public school teachers is rigid and solely based on seniority. This paper studies the effects of a reform that gave school districts in Wisconsin full autonomy to redesign teacher pay schemes. Following the reform some districts switched to flexible compensation. Using the expiration of preexisting collective bargaining agreements as a source of exogenous variation in the timing of changes in pay, I show that the introduction of flexible pay raised salaries of high-quality teachers, increased teacher quality (due to the arrival of high-quality teachers from other districts and increased effort), and improved student achievement.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200295
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Unit Sales and Price Effects of Preannounced Consumption Tax Reforms: Micro-level Evidence from European VAT,Thiess Buettner and Boryana Madzharova,"We study the effects of consumption tax changes on prices and unit sales of durables utilizing micro-level product data. The results show that tax rate changes are fully shifted into prices. An anticipated tax rate change causes a temporary shift in unit sales shortly before implementation, which is more than offset by adjustments upon and after implementation. If the tax rate increases by 1 percentage point, unit sales rise by 2.5 percent on average in the last month before implementation. The permanent effect is a drop in sales by 2 percent below their original level, implying relatively strong intertemporal substitution effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170708
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,"Political Alignment, Attitudes toward Government, and Tax Evasion","Julie Cullen, Nicholas Turner and Ebonya Washington","We ask whether attitudes toward government play a causal role in the evasion of US personal income taxes. As turnover elections move voters in partisan counties into and out of alignment with the party of the president, we find with alignment (i) taxpayers report more easily evaded forms of income; (ii) suspect EITC claims decrease; and (iii) audits triggered and audits found to owe additional tax decrease. Coupled with evidence that alignment leads to more favorable views on taxation and spending, our results provide real world evidence that a positive outlook on government lowers tax evasion.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190409
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Informal Labor and the Efficiency Cost of Social Programs: Evidence from Unemployment Insurance in Brazil,Francois Gerard and Gustavo Gonzaga,"It is widely believed that the presence of a large informal sector increases the efficiency cost of social programs in developing countries. We evaluate such claims for the case of unemployment insurance (UI) by combining an optimal UI framework with comprehensive data from Brazil. Using quasi-experimental variation in potential UI duration, we find clear evidence for the usual moral hazard problem that UI reduces incentives to return to a formal job. Yet, the associated efficiency cost is lower than it is in the United States, and it is lower in labor markets with higher informality within Brazil. This is because formal reemployment rates are lower to begin with where informality is higher, so that a larger share of workers would draw UI benefits absent any moral hazard. In sum, efficiency concerns may actually become more relevant as an economy formalizes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180072
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Consumer Myopia in Vehicle Purchases: Evidence from a Natural Experiment,"Kenneth Gillingham, Sébastien Houde and Arthur A.  van Benthem","A central question in the analysis of fuel economy policy is whether consumers are myopic with regards to future fuel costs. We provide the first evidence on the consumer valuation of fuel economy from a natural experiment that provides exogenous variation in fuel economy ratings. We examine the short-run equilibrium effects of a restatement of fuel economy ratings that affected 1.6 million vehicles. Using the implied changes in willingness to pay, we find that consumers act myopically: consumers are indifferent between $1.00 in discounted fuel costs and $0.16–0.39 in the purchase price when discounting at 4 percent. This undervaluation persists under a wide range of assumptions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200322
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Horizontal Differentiation and the Policy Effect of Charter Schools,"Michael Gilraine, Uros Petronijevic and John Singleton","While school choice may enhance competition, incentives for public schools to raise productivity may be muted if public education is imperfectly substitutable with alternatives. This paper estimates the aggregate effect of charter school expansion on education quality while accounting for the horizontal differentiation of charter programs. Our research design leverages variation following the removal of North Carolina's statewide cap to compare test score changes for students who lived near entering charters to those farther away. We find learning gains that are driven by public schools responding to increased competition from non-horizontally differentiated charter schools, even before those charters actually open.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200531
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Effect of SNAP on the Composition of Purchased Foods: Evidence and Implications,"Justine Hastings, Ryan Kessler and Jesse Shapiro",We use detailed data from a large retail panel to study the effect of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on the composition and nutrient content of foods purchased for at-home consumption. We find that the effect of SNAP participation is small relative to the cross-sectional variation in most of the outcomes we consider. Estimates from a model relating the composition of a household's food purchases to the household's current level of food spending imply that closing the gap in food spending between high- and low-SES households would not close the gap in summary measures of food healthfulness.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190350
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Electric Vehicle Transition and the Economics of Banning Gasoline Vehicles,"Stephen Holland, Erin Mansur and Andrew Yates","Electric vehicles have a unique potential to transform personal transportation. We analyze this transition with a dynamic model capturing falling costs of electric vehicles, decreasing pollution from electricity, and increasing vehicle substitutability. Our calibration to the US market shows a transition from gasoline vehicles is not optimal at current substitutability: a gasoline vehicle production ban would have large deadweight loss. At higher substitutability, a ban can reduce deadweight loss from vehicle mix and adoption timing inefficiencies. A cumulative gasoline vehicle production quota has smaller deadweight loss, and an electric vehicle purchase subsidy is more robust to regulator misperceptions about substitutability.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200120
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Effect of Leaded Gasoline on Elderly Mortality: Evidence from Regulatory Exemptions,Alex Hollingsworth and Ivan Rudik,"Leaded gasoline is still used globally for aviation and automotive racing. Exploiting regulatory exemptions and a novel quasi-experiment, we find that leaded gasoline use in racing increases ambient lead, elevated blood lead rates, and elderly mortality. The mortality estimates indicate that each gram of lead added to gasoline exceeds $1,100 in damages. Our setting allows us to rule out potential confounders, such as correlated pollutants or socioeconomic status. We provide the first causal estimates linking adult mortality to leaded gasoline, highlight the value of banning on-road leaded gasoline, and present policy-relevant cost estimates at the lowest ambient levels to date.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190654
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Women's Suffrage and Children's Education,"Esra Kose, Elira Kuka and Na'ama Shenhav","While a growing literature shows that women, relative to men, prefer greater investment in children, it is unclear whether empowering women produces better economic outcomes. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in US suffrage laws, we show that exposure to suffrage during childhood led to large increases in educational attainment for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, especially Blacks and Southern Whites. We also find that suffrage led to higher earnings alongside education gains, although not for Southern Blacks. Using newly digitized data, we show that education increases are primarily explained by suffrage-induced growth in education spending, although early-life health improvements may have also contributed.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180677
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Preferred Pharmacy Networks and Drug Costs,Amanda Starc and Ashley Swanson,"Selective contracting is an increasingly popular tool for reducing health care costs, but any savings must be weighed against consumer surplus losses from restricted access. Recently, many prescription drug plans (PDPs) utilize preferred pharmacy networks to reduce drug prices. Our results suggest that Medicare Part D plans with preferred pharmacy networks pay lower retail drug prices, while subsidized enrollees' insensitivity to preferred pharmacy cost-sharing discounts reduces these savings. We then estimate pharmacy demand models to quantify the costs and benefits of preferred pharmacy networks, finding that the average enrollee benefits from preferred pharmacy contracting due to reduced out-of-pocket (OOP) costs at preferred pharmacies.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180489

Specifically, I estimate the effects of a Comcast service providing discounted broadband to qualifying low-income families. I use a triple differences strategy exploiting geographic variation in Comcast coverage, individual variation in eligibility, and temporal variation pre- and postlaunch. Local program availability increased employment rates and earnings of eligible individuals, driven by greater labor force participation and decreased probability of unemployment.

The unique bankruptcy rules in Singapore suggest liquidity shocks drive personal bankruptcy decisions, leading to a substantial drop in consumption for the bankrupt. Peers' monthly card consumption decreases by 3.4 percent over the 1-year postbankruptcy period. There exists no consumption decrease among individuals in immediately adjacent buildings nor for consumers with diminished postevent social ties with the bankrupt. The findings imply a significant social multiplier effect of 2.8 times the original consumption shock.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170634

We develop a theoretical model of this situation, and then test the predictions in data on US state-level welfare reforms from 1978 to 2007. This period marked the most dramatic shift in social policy since the New Deal. Our findings indicate that governors with strong electoral support are less likely to experiment than governors with little support. Yet, governors who cannot be reelected actually experiment more than governors striving for reelection.

Comparing adjacent counties located in neighboring states, there is no statistically significant impact of increasing UI generosity on aggregate employment. Point estimates are uniformly small in magnitude, and the most precise estimates rule out employment-to-population ratio reductions in excess of 0.35 percentage points from the UI extension.

AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Heterogeneous Workers and Federal Income Taxes in a Spatial Equilibrium,Mark Colas and Kevin Hutchinson,"We study the geographic incidence and efficiency of an income tax by estimating a spatial equilibrium model with heterogeneous workers. The US income tax shifts households out of high-productivity cities, leading to locational inefficiency of 0.25 percent of output. Removing spatial tax distortions increases inequality because more educated households are more mobile and own larger shares of land. Flattening the tax schedule, or introducing cost-of-living adjustments or local wage adjustments leads to efficiency gains but causes substantial increases in inequality. Differences in mobility and land ownership across skill groups create an equity-efficiency trade-off that is unique to spatial settings.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180529

AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Retail Prices in a City,"Alon Eizenberg, Saul Lach and Merav Oren-Yiftach","This study examines grocery price differentials across neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area (the city of Jerusalem, Israel). Important variation in access to affordable grocery shopping is documented using CPI data on prices and neighborhood-level credit card expenditure data. Residents of peripheral, nonaffluent neighborhoods are charged some of the highest prices in the city and yet display a low tendency to shop outside their neighborhood. In contrast, residents of affluent, centrally located neighborhoods often benefit from lower grocery prices charged in their own neighborhood while also displaying a high propensity to shop at the hard discount grocers located in the city's commercial districts. The role of spatial frictions in shaping these patterns is studied within a structural model where households determine their shopping destination and retailers choose prices. The estimated model implies strong spatial segmentation in households' demand. Counterfactual analyses reveal that alleviating spatial frictions results in considerable benefits to the average resident of the peripheral neighborhoods. At the same time, it barely affects the equilibrium prices charged across the city, and so it does little to benefit households with limited mobility (e.g., the elderly).",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180218

We test whether racial heterogeneity is one cause, exploiting cross-jurisdiction variation in punishment severity in four Southern states. We estimate the causal effect of jurisdiction on arrest outcomes using a fixed effects model that incorporates extensive charge and defendant controls. We validate our estimates using defendants charged in multiple jurisdictions. Consistent with a model of ingroup bias in electorate preferences, the relationship between local severity and Black population share follows an inverted U-shape. Within states, defendants are 27–54 percent more likely to be incarcerated in ""peak"" heterogeneous jurisdictions than in homogeneous jurisdictions.

Using hourly data from the Texas and midcontinent electricity markets, we find that relaxing transmission constraints between the wind-rich areas and the demand centers of the respective markets conservatively increases the nonmarket value of wind by 30 percent for Texas and 17 percent for midcontinent markets. Much of this increase in the nonmarket value arises from a redistribution in where air quality improvements occur—when transmission is not constrained, wind offsets much more pollution from fossil fuel units located near highly populated demand centers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190258

We present four main findings. First, the mortgage deduction has a precisely estimated zero effect on homeownership for high- and middle-income households. Second, the mortgage deduction has a clear effect on housing demand at the intensive margin, inducing homeowners to buy larger and more expensive houses. Third, the deduction has sizeable effects on household financial decisions, inducing them to increase indebtedness.

AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Do School Spending Cuts Matter? Evidence from the Great Recession,"C. Kirabo Jackson, Cora Wigger and Heyu Xiong","During the Great Recession, national public school per-pupil spending fell by roughly 7 percent and persisted beyond the recovery. The impact of such large and sustained education funding cuts is not well understood. To examine this, first, we document that the recessionary drop in spending coincided with the end of decades-long national growth in both test scores and college-going. Next, we show that this stalled educational progress was particularly pronounced in states that experienced larger recessionary budget cuts for plausibly exogenous reasons. To isolate budget cuts that were unrelated to (i) other ill-effects of the recession or (ii) endogenous state policies, we use states' historical reliance on state-appropriated funds (which are more sensitive to the business cycle) to fund public schools interacted with the timing of the recession as instruments for reductions in school spending. Cohorts exposed to these spending cuts had lower test scores and lower college-going rates. The spending cuts led to larger test score gaps by income and race.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180674
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Long-Term Contextual Effects in Education: Schools and Neighborhoods,Jean-William Laliberté,"This paper estimates the long-term impact of growing up in better neighborhoods and attending better schools on educational attainment. First, I use a spatial regression-discontinuity design to estimate school effects. Second, I study students who move across neighborhoods in Montreal during childhood to estimate the causal effect of growing up in a better area (total exposure effects). I find large effects for both dimensions. Combining both research designs in a decomposition framework, and under key assumptions, I estimate that 50–70 percent of the benefits of moving to a better area on educational attainment are due to access to better schools.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190257
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Does the Individual Mandate Affect Insurance Coverage? Evidence from Tax Returns,"Ithai Z. Lurie, Daniel W. Sacks and Bradley Heim","We estimate the effect of the ACA's individual mandate on insurance coverage using regression discontinuity and regression kink designs with tax return data. We have four key results. First, the actual penalty paid per uninsured month is less than half the statutory amount. Second, nonetheless, we find visually clear and statistically significant responses to both extensive margin exposure to the mandate and to marginal increases in the mandate penalty. Third, we find substantial heterogeneity in who responds; men are especially responsive. Fourth, our estimates imply fairly small quantitative responses to the individual mandate, especially in the Health Insurance Exchanges.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180619
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Impacts of Private Prison Contracting on Inmate Time Served and Recidivism,Anita Mukherjee,"This paper examines the impact of private prison contracting by exploiting staggered prison capacity shocks in Mississippi. Motivated by a model based on the typical private prison contract that pays a per diem for each occupied bed, the empirical analysis shows that private prison inmates serve 90 additional days. This is alternatively estimated as 4.8 percent of the average sentence. The delayed release erodes half of the cost savings offered by private contracting and is linked to the greater likelihood of conduct violations in private prisons. The additional days served do not lead to apparent changes in inmate recidivism.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170474
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Macroeconomic Effects of Income and Consumption Tax Changes,"Anh Nguyen, Luisanna Onnis and Raffaele Rossi","This paper estimates the effects of exogenous changes in income and consumption taxes. The tax shocks are proxied with a narrative account of tax liability changes in the United Kingdom. Income tax cuts have large effects on GDP, private consumption, and investment. The effects of consumption tax cuts are modest and not statistically significant on GDP and its components. Shifting the burden of taxation from income to consumption is expansionary. Consistent with conventional public finance theories, these results indicate that it is crucial to distinguish between direct and indirect taxation when studying the transmission mechanism of fiscal policy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170241
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Costs of Corporate Tax Complexity,Eric Zwick,"Does tax code complexity alter corporate behavior? We investigate this question by studying the decision to claim refunds for tax losses. In a sample of 1.2 million observations from the population of corporate tax returns, only 37 percent of eligible firms claim their refund. A simple cost-benefit analysis of the tax loss choice cannot explain low take-up, motivating an exploration of how complexity alters this calculation. Research designs exploiting tax preparer switches, deaths, and relocations show that sophisticated preparers increase claim rates for small firms. Imperfect take-up has implications for measuring marginal tax rates and for the design of fiscal policy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180406
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Climate Change and Agriculture: Subsistence Farmers' Response to Extreme Heat,"Fernando M. Aragón, Francisco Oteiza and Juan Pablo Rud","This paper examines how subsistence farmers respond to extreme heat. Using microdata from Peruvian households, we find that high temperatures reduce agricultural productivity, increase area planted, and change crop mix. These findings are consistent with farmers using input adjustments as a short-term mechanism to attenuate the effect of extreme heat on output. This response seems to complement other coping strategies, such as selling livestock, but exacerbates the drop in yields, a standard measure of agricultural productivity. Using our estimates, we show that accounting for land adjustments is important to quantify damages associated with climate change.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190316

And can skilled managers identify them? A large-scale randomized trial conducted with the police of Rajasthan, India, tested four interventions recommended by senior police officers: limitations of transfers, rotation of duties and days off, increased community involvement, and on-duty training. Field experience motivated a fifth intervention: ""decoy"" visits by enumerators to register cases, incentivizing staff to improve service. Only training and decoy visits had robust impacts; others were poorly implemented and ineffective. Management reforms can improve policing, but even skilled leaders struggle to identify the optimal interventions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190664
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Impact of Paid Maternity Leave on Maternal Health,"Aline Bütikofer, Julie Riise and Meghan Skira","We examine the impact of the introduction of paid maternity leave in Norway in 1977 on maternal health in the medium and long term. Using administrative data combined with survey data on the health of women around age 40, we find the reform improved a range of maternal health outcomes, including BMI, blood pressure, pain, and mental health. The reform also increased health-promoting behaviors, such as exercise and not smoking. The effects were larger for first-time and low-resource mothers and women who would have taken little unpaid leave in the absence of the reform.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190022
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Influence and Information in Team Decisions: Evidence from Medical Residency,David C. Chan,"I study team decisions among physician trainees. Exploiting a discontinuity in team roles across trainee tenure, I find evidence that teams alter decision-making, concentrating influence in the hands of senior trainees. I also demonstrate little convergence in variation of trainee effects despite intensive training. This general pattern of trainee effects on team decision-making exists in all types of decisions and settings that I examine. In analyses evaluating mechanisms behind this pattern, I find support for the idea that significant experiential learning occurs during training and that teams place more weight on judgments of senior trainees in order to aggregate information.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180501
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Can Successful Schools Replicate? Scaling Up Boston's Charter School Sector,"Sarah Cohodes, Elizabeth M. Setren and Christopher Walters","Can schools that boost student outcomes reproduce their success at new campuses? We study a policy reform that allowed effective charter schools in Boston, Massachusetts to replicate their school models at new locations. Estimates based on randomized admission lotteries show that replication charter schools generate large achievement gains on par with those produced by their parent campuses. The average effectiveness of Boston's charter middle school sector increased after the reform despite a doubling of charter market share. An exploration of mechanisms shows that Boston charter schools compress the distribution of teacher effectiveness and may reduce the returns to teacher experience, suggesting the highly standardized practices in place at charter schools may facilitate replicability.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190259
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Relative Prices and Climate Policy: How the Scarcity of Nonmarket Goods Drives Policy Evaluation,Moritz Drupp and Martin C. Hänsel,"Climate change not only impacts production and market consumption but also the relative scarcity of nonmarket goods, such as environmental amenities. We study fundamental drivers of the resulting relative price changes, their potential magnitude, and their implications for climate policy in Nordhaus's Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model, thereby addressing one of its key criticisms. We propose plausible ranges for these relative prices changes based on best available evidence. Our central calibration reveals that accounting for relative prices is equivalent to decreasing pure time preference by 0.6 percentage points and leads to a more than 50 percent higher social cost of carbon.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180760
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Rising Intergenerational Income Persistence in China,"Yi Fan, Junjian Yi and Junsen Zhang","This paper documents an increasing intergenerational income persistence in China since economic reforms were introduced in 1979. The intergenerational income elasticity increases from 0.390 for the 1970–1980 birth cohort to 0.442 for the 1981–1988 birth cohort; this increase is more evident among urban and coastal residents than rural and inland residents. We also explore how changes in intergenerational income persistence is correlated with market reforms, economic development, and policy changes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170097
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Sensitivity of Housing Demand to Financing Conditions: Evidence from a Survey,Andreas Fuster and Basit Zafar,"Measuring the sensitivity of housing demand to mortgage rates and available leverage is challenging because there is generally no exogenous variation in these variables. This paper circumvents this issue by designing a strategic survey in which respondents report their willingness to pay (WTP) for a home under different financing scenarios. Relaxation of down payment constraints or an exogenous increase in nonhousing wealth has large effects on WTP, especially for poorer and more credit-constrained households. However, changing the mortgage rate has only moderate effects on WTP. These findings have implications for theoretical models of house price determination and for policy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20150337
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Unemployment Insurance Taxes and Labor Demand: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Administrative Data,Andrew Johnston,"To finance unemployment insurance, states raise payroll tax rates on employers who engage in layoffs. Tax rates are, therefore, highest for firms after downturns, potentially hampering labor-market recovery. Using full-population, administrative records from Florida, I estimate the effect of these tax increases on firm behavior leveraging a regression kink design in the tax schedule. Tax hikes reduce hiring and employment substantially, with no effect on layoffs or wages. The results imply unanticipated costs of the financing regime which reduce the optimal benefit by a quarter and account for 12 percent of the unemployment in the wake of the Great Recession.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190031
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,The Long-Run Effects of a Public Policy on Alcohol Tastes and Mortality,Lorenz Kueng and Evgeny Yakovlev,"We study the long-run effects of Russia's anti-alcohol campaign, which dramatically altered the relative supply of hard and light alcohol in the late 1980s. We find that this policy shifted young men's long-run preferences from hard to light alcohol decades later, and we estimate the age at which consumers form their tastes. We show that the large beer market expansion in the late 1990s had similar effects on young consumers' tastes, while older consumers' tastes remained largely unchanged. We then link these long-run changes in alcohol consumption patterns to changes in male mortality. The shift from hard to light alcohol reduced incidences of binge drinking substantially, leading to fewer alcohol-related deaths. We conclude that the resulting large cohort differences in current alcohol consumption shares explain a significant part of the recent decrease in male mortality. Simulations suggest that mortality will continue to decrease by another 23 percent over the next 20 years due to persistent changes in consumer tastes. Program impact evaluations that focus only on contemporaneous effects can therefore severely underestimate the total effect of such public policies that change preferences for goods.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180439
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,"Parental Support, Savings, and Student Loan Repayment","Lance Lochner, Todd Stinebrickner and Utku Suleymanoglu","Using unique survey and administrative data from Canada, we document that parental support and personal savings substantially reduce student loan repayment problems. Developing a model of student borrowing and repayment, we show that nonmonetary costs of applying for income-based repayment assistance are critical to understanding our findings. Furthermore, we show that eliminating these costs may be inefficient. Empirically, we show that expanding Canada's Repayment Assistance Plan to automatically cover all borrowers could reduce program revenue by half over early repayment years. Finally, we show how student loan programs can be more efficiently designed.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180401
AEJ: Economic Policy,2021,Who Benefits When Firms Game Corrective Policies?,Mathias Reynaert and James M. Sallee,"Firms sometimes comply with externality-correcting policies by gaming the measure that determines policy. This harms buyers by eroding information, but it benefits them when cost savings are passed through into prices. We develop a model that highlights this tension and use it to analyze gaming of automobile carbon emission ratings in the EU. We document startling increases in gaming using novel data. We then analyze the effects of gaming in calibrated simulations. Over a wide range of parameters, we find that pass-through substantially outweighs information distortions; on net, buyers benefit from gaming, even when they are fooled by it.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190019
