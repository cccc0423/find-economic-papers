The Review of Financial Studies,2024,Are Bankruptcy Professional Fees Excessively High?,Samuel Antill,"Chapter 7 is the most popular bankruptcy system for U.S. firms and individuals. Chapter 7 professional fees are substantial. Theoretically, high fees might be an unavoidable cost of incentivizing professionals. I test this empirically. I study trustees, the most important professionals in chapter 7, who liquidate assets in exchange for legally mandated commissions. Exploiting kinks in the commission function, I estimate a structural model of moral hazard by trustees. I show that a policy change lowering trustee fees would harm trustee incentives, reducing liquidation values. Nonetheless, such a policy would dramatically improve creditor recovery, increasing small-business-lender recovery by 15.7%.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae057
The Review of Financial Studies,2024,The Imitation Game: The Imitation Game: How Encouraging Renegotiation Makes Good Borrowers Bad,"Sean Flynn, Andra Ghent and Alexei Tchistyi","We show that commercial mortgage borrowers behave opportunistically to attempt to obtain principal reductions. We develop a model in which lenders cannot perfectly observe borrowers’ use values and renegotiation is costly. We then exploit a tax rule change that reduced the cost of renegotiation. Consistent with the model predictions, borrowers with high private use values of the property are more likely to transfer into special servicing when lenders have a higher capacity to negotiate principal reductions after the rule change. Our results suggest adverse consequences of principal forgiveness for lenders.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae060
The Review of Financial Studies,2024,The Impact of Crisis-Period Interest Rate Declines on Distressed Borrowers,Stuart Gabriel and Chandler Lutz,"We measure the causal impact of reductions in benchmark interest rates on the renegotiation and performance of distressed loans, using 2000s subprime mortgages as a laboratory. Subprime borrowers treated with larger benchmark rate reductions benefited from increased debt-renegotiation probabilities and lower debt-service payments. Modification rates were similar among current and delinquent borrowers but higher for real estate investors, highlighting the role of financial acumen in renegotiation. Renegotiations also reduced longer-run foreclosures, but treated borrowers who lingered in delinquency offset these benefits. Findings suggest monetary easing can spur debt renegotiation but alone may not lead to longer-run curative outcomes.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae051
The Review of Financial Studies,2024,"Student Loans, Access to Credit, and Consumer Credit Demand","Alvaro Mezza, Daniel Ringo and Kamila Sommer","This paper provides novel evidence that increased student loan debts, caused by rising tuitions, increase borrowers’ demand for additional consumer debt, while simultaneously restricting their ability to access it. The net effect of student loan debt on consumer borrowing varies by market, depending on whether the supply or demand channel dominates. In loosely underwritten credit markets, increased student loan debt causes borrowing to increase, while in tightly underwritten markets, increased student loan debt reduces credit use. These findings match predictions of a standard life cycle model of household consumption and borrowing, augmented by a realistic student loan repayment contract.

We show that these contracts make loan syndication harder by reducing banks’ willingness to participate in loans underwritten by banks named in their RPE contracts.

A regulation following from Dodd-Frank prohibits municipal advisors from simultaneously acting as bond underwriters. Using a difference-in-differences approach and 20,051 bond auctions, I test whether limited advisor privileges affect financial advice and borrower outcomes. Financing costs of bonds with potential dual advisor-underwriters fall by 11.4 basis points after the advisor is no longer allowed to underwrite. The decline follows from increases in standardization, third-party certification, and auction participation, all of which are consistent with limiting the adverse selection that arises from advisors withholding information from the market.

Spikes increase when firms face financial constraints or higher option values of waiting. Cumulative investment does not completely reverse after spikes. We develop an investment model with tax asymmetries to rationalize these patterns.

Consistent with experience-based learning, this effect increases with signal strength and repetition and decreases with country-level climate adaptation. Subsequent replacement suppliers show a lower expected and realized but similar projected heat exposure. We find similar results for suppliers’ exposure to floods.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhad093

We construct dictionaries that measure physical and transition climate risks separately and identify firms that proactively respond to climate risks. Our validation analysis shows that our measures capture firm-level variations in respective climate risk exposure. Firms facing high transition risk, especially those that do not proactively respond, have been valued at a discount in recent years as aggregate investor attention to climate-related issues has been increasing.

Beyond the income and savings channels, we uncover a novel mechanism contributing to the negative wealth effects of automation that arises through the endogenous optimal portfolio decisions of households. We show that households rebalance their financial wealth away from the stock market in response to increased human capital risk induced by pervasive automation, thereby attaining lower wealth levels and relative positions in the wealth distribution. Our evidence suggests that the portfolio channel amplifies the inequality-enhancing effects of increased automation.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhad050
The Review of Financial Studies,2024,"Who Mismanages Student Loans, and Why?",Kimberly Cornaggia and Han Xia,"Many financially distressed students who qualify for federal assistance plans with interest moratorium and principal forgiveness instead accrue interest over long periods of nonpayment. This loan mismanagement is associated with higher delinquency. Mismanagement varies significantly across student gender and race: it is more prominent among male and non-white students. Mismanagement also varies across loan servicers, depending on proxies for student-adverse servicer policies. We consider explanations based on student selection and servicer treatment for loan mismanagement. Student financial literacy plays an important role but variation in treatment on the part of loan servicers appears more important.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhad058
The Review of Financial Studies,2024,What Private Equity Does Differently: Evidence from Life Insurance,Divya Kirti and Natasha Sarin,"This paper studies how private equity creates value and its consequences for consumer welfare in the insurance industry, where PE investments grew tenfold following the financial crisis. PE firms add value through regulatory and tax arbitrage that increases profits relative to their non-PE counterparts. Crucially, the impact on consumer welfare is nuanced: in the short run, consumers benefit from more favorably priced products. But the arbitrage strategy also exposes them to more risk, as annual expected losses scaled by capital buffers rise by 50 percentage points. This creates the possibility of consumer harm in the event of a downturn.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhad055
The Review of Financial Studies,2024,Business Group Spillovers,S Lakshmi Naaraayanan and Daniel Wolfenzon,"We compare the investment of standalone firms across regions after a positive shock to the investment opportunities generated by a large-scale highway development project. We show that the standalones’ investment sensitivity is lower in regions with a higher density of business groups in the local area. We investigate mechanisms driving our results and find support for a financing mechanism whereby banks allocate capital preferentially to group-affiliated firms in responding to the increase in credit demand. Overall, our study documents that business groups have spillover effects on standalone firms.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhad057
The Review of Financial Studies,2024,Banks as Liquidity Multipliers,Sylvain Carré and Damien Klossner,"We characterize the interaction between banks’ liquid assets purchases and deposit issuance decisions. Using global games, we derive a liquidity multiplier: the amount of deposits a bank can create when endowed with one additional unit of liquid asset to maintain a given level of liquidity risk. In our central theorem, we prove it is larger than unity. This entails that banks have a special role in enhancing liquidity provision, “multiplying” liquid assets into a larger quantity of deposits. Our theory has implications for banks’ balance sheet choices, the pricing of liquid securities, and the role of public liquidity provision.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhad053
