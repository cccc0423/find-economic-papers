Journal of Political Economy,2023,Intermediation and Voluntary Exposure to Counterparty Risk,Maryam Farboodi,"I study a model of the financial sector in which intermediation among debt-financed banks gives rise to an endogenous core-periphery network. Endogenous intermediation generates excessive systemic risk in the financial network. Financial institutions have incentives to capture intermediation spreads through strategic borrowing and lending decisions. By doing so, they tilt the division of surplus along an intermediation chain in their favor, while at the same time reducing aggregate surplus. The network is inefficient relative to a constrained-efficient benchmark, since banks that make risky investments “overconnect,” exposing themselves to excessive counterparty risk, while banks that mainly provide funding end up with too few connections.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725168
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Centralizing Over-the-Counter Markets?,Jason Allen and Milena Wittwer,"In traditional over-the-counter markets, investors trade bilaterally through intermediaries. We assess whether and how to shift trades on a centralized platform with trade-level data on the Canadian government bond market. We document that intermediaries charge a markup when trading with investors and specify a model to quantify price and welfare effects from market centralization. We find that many investors would not use the platform, even if they could, because it is costly, competition for investors is low, and investors value relationships with intermediaries. Market centralization can even decrease welfare, unless competition is sufficiently strong.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725361
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Reserve Prices in Internet Advertising Auctions: A Field Experiment,Michael Ostrovsky and Michael Schwarz,"We present the results of a large field experiment on setting reserve prices in auctions for online advertisements, guided by the theory of optimal auction design suitably adapted to the sponsored search setting. Consistent with the theory, revenues increased substantially after the new reserve prices were introduced.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725702
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Learning Efficiency of Multiagent Information Structures,"Mira Frick, Ryota Iijima and Yuhta Ishii","Which information structures are more effective at eliminating first- and higher-order uncertainty and hence at facilitating efficient play in coordination games? We consider a learning setting where players observe many private signals about the state. First, we characterize multiagent learning efficiency, that is, the rate at which players approximate common knowledge. We find that this coincides with the rate at which first-order uncertainty disappears, as higher-order uncertainty vanishes faster than first-order uncertainty. Second, we show that with enough signal draws, information structures with higher learning efficiency induce higher equilibrium welfare. We highlight information design implications for games in data-rich environments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725171
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Experimental Tests of Rational Inattention,Mark Dean and Nathaniel Neligh,"We use laboratory experiments to test models of rational inattention, in which people acquire information to maximize utility net of information costs. We show that subjects adjust their attention in response to changes in incentives, in line with the rational inattention model. However, our results are qualitatively inconsistent with information costs that are linear in Shannon entropy, as is often assumed in applied work. Our data are best fit by a generalization of the Shannon model, which allows for a more flexible response to incentives and for some states of the world to be harder to distinguish than others.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725174
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Supply Chain Resilience: Should Policy Promote International Diversification or Reshoring?,"Gene M. Grossman, Elhanan Helpman and Hugo Lhuillier","Little is known about optimal policy in the face of global supply chain disruptions. Should governments promote resilience by subsidizing backup sources of input supply in multiple countries? Should they encourage firms to source from safer domestic suppliers? We address these questions in a model of production with a critical input and exogenous risks of supply disturbances. With constant elasticity of substitution preferences, a subsidy for diversification achieves the constrained social optimum. When the demand elasticity rises with price, private investments in resilience may be socially excessive and the social planner may wish to discourage diversification while favoring sourcing from abroad.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725173
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Multidimensional Sorting under Random Search,Ilse Lindenlaub and Fabien Postel-Vinay,"We analyze sorting in a frictional labor market when workers and jobs have multidimensional characteristics. We say that matching is positive assortative in dimension (j, k) if workers with higher endowment in skill k are matched to a job distribution with higher values of attribute j in the first-order stochastic dominance sense. Crucial for sorting is a single-crossing property of technology. Sorting is positive between worker-job attributes with strong complementarities but negative in other dimensions. Finally, sorting is based on comparative advantage: workers sort into jobs that suit their skill mix rather than their overall skill level.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725362
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Optimal Dynamic Mediation,Jack Fanning,"How should mediators communicate with bargainers? When can they improve outcomes? Can arbitrators that impose outcomes do better? I provide answers in wars of attrition with flexible and commitment types, consistent with reputational bargaining. I characterize the unique mediated equilibrium, which maximizes flexible types’ payoffs. The mediator immediately elicits private information but waits to suggest agreements. She front-loads agreements between flexible types, while initially delaying any involving commitment types. This improves on unmediated outcomes only if commitment probabilities are less than agents’ payoff share in their preferred agreement. Arbitrators do strictly better but sometimes impose disagreement, which may be hard to enforce.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724858
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Shocks and Technology Adoption: Evidence from Electronic Payment Systems,"Nicolas Crouzet, Apoorv Gupta and Filippo Mezzanotti","We provide evidence on the importance of coordination frictions in technology adoption, using data from a large provider of electronic wallets during the Indian demonetization. Exploiting geographical variation in exposure to the demonetization, we show that adoption of the wallet increased persistently in response to the large but temporary cash contraction, consistent with the predictions of a technology adoption model with complementarities. Model estimates indicate that adoption would have been 45% lower without complementarities. Our results illustrate how large but temporary interventions can help overcome coordination frictions, though we caution that such interventions may also exacerbate initial differences in adoption.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724847
Journal of Political Economy,2023,"Information Frictions, Reputation, and Sovereign Spreads",Juan Morelli and Matias Moretti,"We formulate a reputational model in which the type of government is time varying and private information. Agents adjust their beliefs about the government’s type (i.e., reputation) using noisy signals about its policies. We consider a debt repayment setting in which reputation influences the market’s perceived probability of default, which affects sovereign spreads. We focus on the 2007–12 Argentine episode of inflation misreport to quantify how markets price reputation. We find that the misreports significantly increased Argentina’s sovereign spreads. We use those estimates to discipline our model and show that reputation can have long-lasting effects on a government’s borrowing costs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724855
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Gainers and Losers in Priority Services,Alex Gershkov and Eyal Winter,"We analyze the implications of priority service (PS) on customers’ welfare. In monopoly markets, PS can often decrease consumer surplus and can even yield a loss of welfare to all consumers. This happens despite its efficiency gains, as monopolists levy in revenue more than the total efficiency gains. PS can increase consumer surplus if it expands the consumption coverage—that is, if it introduces new customers who would not purchase the service otherwise. In duopoly markets, the price competition over PS can be severely eroded. Under homogeneity, firms act as if they were monopolists serving half of the market.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724850
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Disability Insurance Income Saves Lives,"Alexander Gelber, Timothy Moore, Zhuan Pei and Alexander Strand","We show that higher payments from US Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) reduce mortality. Using administrative data on new DI beneficiaries, we exploit discontinuities in the benefit formula through a regression kink design. We estimate that $1,000 more in annual DI payments decreases the annual mortality rate of lower-income beneficiaries by approximately 0.18–0.35 percentage points, implying an elasticity of mortality with respect to DI income of around −0.6 to −1.0. We find no robust evidence of an effect of DI income on the mortality of higher-income beneficiaries.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725172
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Informed Information Design,Frederic Koessler and Vasiliki Skreta,"We study informed persuasion, whereby a privately informed designer without ex ante commitment power chooses disclosure mechanisms to influence agents’ actions. We characterize the subset of Bayes-correlated equilibria yielding every designer type a payoff higher than what they could get from any disclosure mechanism with credible beliefs. This set of interim-optimal mechanisms is nonempty and tractable, and all its elements are perfect Bayesian equilibrium mechanisms of the informed-designer game. Interim-optimal mechanisms are characterized via belief-based approaches in pure persuasion settings. We identify single- and multiagent interactive environments in which ex ante–optimal mechanisms are interim optimal.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724843
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Public Debt as Private Liquidity: Optimal Policy,"George-Marios Angeletos, Fabrice Collard and Harris Dellas","We study optimal policy in an economy where interest rates are low because public debt serves as collateral or buffer stock. Issuing more public debt raises welfare by easing the underlying friction but also reduces the private valuation of this service, raising interest rates. This trade-off shapes the optimal quantity of public debt in the long run, justifies a departure from tax smoothing in the short run, and calls for larger deficits during financial crises. Our analysis illustrates the possible robustness of these insights to different microfoundations and helps clarify when exactly low interest rates represent an opportunity for cheap government borrowing.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725170

Journal of Political Economy,2023,Multiproduct Cost Pass-Through: Edgeworth’s Paradox Revisited,Mark Armstrong and John Vickers,"Edgeworth’s paradox of taxation occurs when an increase in the unit cost of a product causes a multiproduct monopolist to reduce prices. We give simple illustrations of the paradox and a general analysis of the case of linear marginal cost and demand conditions, and we characterize which matrices of cost pass-through terms are consistent with profit maximization. When the firm supplies at least one pair of substitute products, we show how Edgeworth’s paradox always occurs with a suitable choice of cost function. We then establish a connection between Ramsey pricing and the paradox in a form relating to consumer surplus.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724573
Journal of Political Economy,2023,"Information Acquisition, Efficiency, and Nonfundamental Volatility",Benjamin Hebert and Jennifer La’O,"We analyze efficiency and nonfundamental volatility in a class of generalized beauty-contest economies with endogenous information. As in models of rational-expectations equilibria, agents learn about exogenous states and endogenous aggregate actions. As in models of rational inattention, agents choose their information structures subject to a cost. We identify conditions on information costs that guarantee the existence of efficient or inefficient equilibria; we further identify conditions that guarantee the existence or nonexistence of equilibria with zero nonfundamental volatility. Mutual information, the cost typically assumed in rational-inattention models, guarantees the existence of an efficient equilibrium with zero nonfundamental volatility.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724575

Lee and Matt McGue","We extend a standard model of parental investment and intergenerational mobility to include a fully specified genetic analysis of skill transmission. The model’s predictions differ substantially from the standard model’s. The coefficient of intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) may be larger than that in the standard model and depends on the distribution of the genotype. The distribution of genetic endowments may be stratified according to income. The model is tested on data, including genetic information, of twins and their parents, estimating how IGE is affected by genetic factors and how environment and genes interact. The effect of intelligence is substantially stronger than that of other traits.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724860
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Labor Market Conflict and the Decline of the Rust Belt,"Simeon D. Alder, David Lagakos and Lee Ohanian","No region of the United States fared worse over the postwar period than the Rust Belt. This paper analyzes how much of its decline can be accounted for by the persistent labor market conflict that characterized Rust Belt union-management relations. We develop a multisector, multiregion, dynamic general equilibrium model in which labor market conflict leads to strikes, wage premia, lower investment, and lower productivity growth. These lead to shrinking Rust Belt industries and to workers moving out of the Rust Belt. Labor conflict accounts for half of the decline in the region’s share of manufacturing employment. Foreign competition plays a smaller role, and its effects are concentrated after most of the region’s decline had already occurred.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724852
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Sovereign Debt Ratchets and Welfare Destruction,"Peter DeMarzo, Zhiguo He and Fabrice Tourre","We study an impatient, risk-neutral government that cannot commit to a particular debt path, financed by competitive lenders. In equilibrium, debt adjusts slowly toward a debt-to-income target, exacerbating booms and busts. Strikingly, gains from trade dissipate when trading is continuous, leaving the government no better off than in financial autarky, owing to a sovereign “debt ratchet effect.” Moreover, citizens who are more patient than their government are strictly harmed. We characterize equilibrium debt dynamics, ergodics, and comparative statics when income follows a geometric Brownian motion and analyze devices that allow the sovereign to recapture gains from trade.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724571
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Multidimensional Premarital Investments with Imperfect Commitment,"V. Bhaskar, Wenchao Li and Junjian Yi","We analyze premarital investments in human capital and housing when individuals are unable to make binding commitments to share their labor income with a prospective spouse. Investments are distorted if there are gender differences in bargaining power over own labor income or marriage market imbalances. Distortions are magnified when ex ante bargaining power favors one sex (e.g., women in China) and ex post bargaining power favors the other (e.g., men in China), since parents of boys will increase housing investments in order to credibly commit to share more resources with the boy’s potential wife, possibly crowding out human capital investments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724574
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Incentives and Performance with Optimal Money Management Contracts,Stefano Pegoraro,"I characterize the dynamics of incentives in an optimal contract with investment delegation, moral hazard, and uncertainty about the agent’s productivity. The principal increases the agent’s incentives after good performance in order to delegate more capital to an agent with higher perceived productivity, thus implementing a convex pay-for-performance scheme. Moreover, the principal commits to reduce the agent’s future incentives in order to mitigate ex ante investment distortions. Methodologically, I provide a duality-based strategy to overcome technical challenges common to continuous-time contracting models with state variables. I also derive a sufficient condition to verify the validity of the first-order approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724576
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Firm-Embedded Productivity and Cross-Country Income Differences,"Vanessa Alviarez, Javier Cravino and Natalia Ramondo","We measure the contribution of firm-embedded productivity to cross-country income differences. By firm-embedded productivity we refer to firm-specific components of productivity, such as blueprints, management practices, and other intangible capital. Using micro-level data for multinational enterprises (MNEs), we compare market shares of the same MNE in different countries and document that they are systematically larger in less developed countries. This indicates that MNEs face less competition and that firm-embedded productivity is scarce in these countries. We implement a measure of firm-embedded productivity based on this observation. Differences in firm-embedded productivity account for one-third of the cross-country variance in output per worker in our sample.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724314
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Fiscal Stimulus under Sovereign Risk,"Javier Bianchi, Pablo Ottonello and Ignacio Presno","What is the optimal fiscal policy response to a recession when the government is subject to sovereign risk? We study this question in a model of endogenous sovereign default with nominal rigidities. Increasing spending in a recession reduces unemployment, but it exposes the government to a debt crisis. We quantitatively analyze this trade-off between stimulus and austerity and find that expanding government spending may be undesirable, even in the presence of sizable Keynesian stabilization gains and inequality concerns. Consistent with these findings, we show that sovereign risk is a key driver of the fiscal procyclicality observed worldwide.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724317
Journal of Political Economy,2023,No Kin in the Game: Moral Hazard and War in the US Congress,"Eoin McGuirk, Nathaniel Hilger and Nicholas Miller",We study agency frictions in the US Congress. We examine the long-standing hypothesis that political elites engage in conflict because they fail to internalize the associated costs. We compare the voting behavior of legislators with draft age sons versus draft age daughters during the conscription-era wars of the twentieth century. We estimate that having a draft age son reduces proconscription voting by 7–11 percentage points. Support for conscription recovers when a legislator’s son ages out of eligibility. We establish that agency problems contribute to political conflict and that politicians are influenced by private incentives orthogonal to political concerns or ideological preferences.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724316
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Collective Progress: Dynamics of Exit Waves,"Esat Doruk Cetemen, Can Urgun and Leeat Yariv","We introduce a framework for studying collective search by teams. Discoveries are correlated over time and governed by a Brownian path, where search speed is jointly controlled. Agents individually choose when to cease search and implement their best discovery. We characterize equilibrium and optimal policies. Search speeds are constant within active alliances and depend on complementarities between members. A drawdown stopping boundary governs each agent’s search termination. The consequent exit waves, whereby possibly heterogeneous agents cease search simultaneously, exhibit deterministic sequencing but stochastic timing. We highlight environments with lower than optimal equilibrium speeds and search durations, and different exit waves.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724321
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Local Evidence and Diversity in Minipublics,Arjada Bardhi and Nina Bobkova,"A policymaker selects a minipublic—a group of citizens from a demographically diverse citizenry with access to local evidence about the impact of a policy. Citizens face uncertainty about the policymaker’s eventual policy bias, which is shown to discourage the most marginally informative minipublic citizens from discovering their evidence. We fully characterize the optimal minipublic composition. Relative to the most demographically representative minipublic, the optimal minipublic overrepresents demographics at the margins of the citizenry while underrepresenting those around the median citizen. The representativeness of the optimal minipublic varies nonmonotonically with uncertainty. Our findings bear practical implications for minipublic design.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724322
Journal of Political Economy,2023,"Trade, Technology, and Agricultural Productivity",Farid Farrokhi and Heitor Pellegrina,"We examine the contribution of trade to the rise of modern agriculture, taking into account interactions between trade, input requirements, and technology adoption. We develop and estimate a new multicountry general equilibrium model that incorporates producers’ choices of which crops to produce and with which technologies at the level of grid cells covering the earth’s surface. We find that trade cost reductions in agricultural inputs and the international transmission of productivity growth in the agricultural input sector since the 1980s induced large shifts from traditional, labor-intensive technologies to modern, input-intensive ones, with important global and distributional implications for productivity and welfare.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724319
Journal of Political Economy,2023,The Stakeholder Corporation and Social Welfare,Marc Fleurbaey and Gregory Ponthiere,"The stakeholder (or responsible) firm maximizes the (weighted or unweighted) sum of the surpluses of its customers and suppliers (including workers). Although this objective is hard to empirically measure, it can be pursued by simple management rules that rely on constrained profit maximization. Unconstrained profit maximization gives a competitive edge to ordinary firms, but stakeholder firms are better for social welfare and internalize several important effects of their activities on society. Long-term entry decisions should rely on profit modified by Pigouvian pricing of externalities, and this result provides a novel justification for the polluter-pays principle.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724318
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Understanding Cross-Country Differences in Health Status and Expenditures: Health Prices Matter,"Raquel Fonseca, Francois Langot, Pierre-Carl Michaud and Thepthida Sopraseuth","Using a general equilibrium heterogeneous agent model featuring health production, we quantify the contribution of health price in explaining cross-country differences in health expenditures and health status. Considering other country-specific explanatory factors, US health prices are estimated to be 33% higher than those of European countries. This price differential explains more than 60% of the difference in health expenditures and more than half of the difference in health status between Europe and the United States. Despite its large impact at the aggregate level, these price differences increase the lifetime cost of living of Americans by 2 percentage points.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724113
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Recipes and Economic Growth: A Combinatorial March Down an Exponential Tail,Charles Jones,"As Romer and Weitzman emphasized in the 1990s, new ideas are often combinations of existing ideas, an insight absent from recent models. In Kortum's research around the same time, ideas are draws from a probability distribution, and Pareto distributions play a crucial role. Why are combinations missing, and do we really need such strong distributional assumptions to get exponential growth? This paper demonstrates that combinatorially growing draws from standard thin-tailed distributions lead to exponential growth; Pareto is not required. More generally, it presents a theorem linking the max extreme value to the number of draws and the shape of the upper tail for probability distributions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723631
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Identifying the Effect of Persuasion,Sung Jae Jun and Sokbae (Simon) Lee,"This paper examines a commonly used measure of persuasion whose precise interpretation has been obscure in the literature. By using the potential outcome framework, we define the causal persuasion rate by a proper conditional probability of taking the action of interest with a persuasive message conditional on not taking the action without the message. We then formally study identification under empirically relevant data scenarios and show that the commonly adopted measure generally does not estimate—but often overstates—the causal rate of persuasion. We discuss several new parameters of interest and provide practical methods for causal inference.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724114
Journal of Political Economy,2023,What Happened to US Business Dynamism?,Ufuk Akcigit and Sina T. Ates,"We attempt to understand potential common forces behind rising market concentration and a slowdown in business dynamism in the US economy, through a micro-founded general equilibrium model of endogenous firm dynamics. The model captures the strategic behavior between competing firms, its effect on their innovation decisions, and the resulting “best-versus-the-rest” dynamics. We consider multiple potential mechanisms that can drive the observed changes and use the calibrated model to assess their relative importance, with particular attention to the implied transitional dynamics. Our results highlight the dominant role of a decline in the intensity of knowledge diffusion from frontier firms to laggard ones. We present new evidence that corroborates a declining knowledge diffusion in the economy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724289
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Determinacy without the Taylor Principle,George-Marios Angeletos and Chen Lian,"Our understanding of monetary policy is complicated by an indeterminacy problem: the same path for the nominal interest rate is consistent with multiple equilibrium paths for inflation and output. We offer a potential resolution by showing that small frictions in social memory and intertemporal coordination can remove this indeterminacy. Under our perturbations, the unique equilibrium is the same as that selected by the Taylor principle, but it no more relies on it; monetary policy is left to play only a stabilization role; and fiscal policy needs to be Ricardian even when monetary policy is passive.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723634
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Returns to On-the-Job Soft Skills Training,"Achyuta Adhvaryu, Namrata Kala and Anant Nyshadham","We estimate productivity gains of 13.5% from workplace soft skills training among Indian garment workers. Productivity gains are greater when trainees work on joint operations alongside other coworkers, consistent with gains being driven by improved teamwork and collaboration. Furthermore, untreated coworkers on the treated production lines also show increased productivity. These improvements in the teamwork substitute for managerial attention. Despite productivity gains and higher promotion probabilities among treated workers, there are no effects on wages or retention, consistent with frictions in this labor market. Consequently, the net return to the firm was large: 256% 8 months after program completion.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724320

The model features heterogeneity in financial frictions across regions, with the costs of accessing credit and deposits depending on the distance from the nearest branch.

We provide aggregation results summarizing the macro implications of micro-level markup heterogeneity. We calibrate our model to US Census of Manufactures data and find that the costs of markups can be large. We decompose the costs into three channels: an aggregate markup that acts like a uniform output tax, misallocation of factors of production, and inefficient entry. We find that the aggregate-markup and misallocation channels account for most of the costs of markups and that the entry channel is much less important.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722986

Journal of Political Economy,2023,The Conservation Multiplier,Bard Harstad,"Every government that controls an exhaustible resource must decide whether to exploit it or conserve it and thereby let the subsequent government decide whether to exploit or conserve. This paper develops a positive theory of this situation and shows when a small change in parameter values has a multiplier effect on exploitation. The multiplier strengthens the influence of a lobby paying for exploitation and of a donor compensating for conservation. A successful donor pays every period for each unit; a successful lobby pays once. This asymmetry causes inefficient exploitation. A normative analysis uncovers when compensations are optimally offered to the party in power, to the general public, or to the lobby.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723637
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Learning and Money Adoption,Michael Choi and Fan Liang,"We consider a dynamic monetary economy where agents gradually learn about the holding cost of a new asset and coordinate to adopt it as money or abandon it. We provide closed-form solutions for state-contingent asset prices and agents’ adoption decision. The transactional benefits of using money are endogenous and can convexify or concavify the payoff structure. Thus, the arrival of new information can raise or reduce the asset’s price, which is in sharp contrast to standard insights in experimentation models. Full disclosure of the asset type and an increase in the learning speed improve information but have different welfare implications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722983

Persuasion may totally collapse in a Markov perfect equilibrium of this game. However, for persuasion costs sufficiently small, a version of a folk theorem holds: outcomes that approximate Kamenica and Gentzkow’s sender-optimal persuasion as well as full revelation and everything in between are obtained in Markov perfect equilibrium as the cost vanishes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722985
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Patent Publication and Innovation,"Deepak Hegde, Kyle Herkenhoff and Chenqi Zhu","We measure how patent publication affects innovation by exploiting the American Inventor’s Protection Act of 1999 (AIPA), which accelerated public disclosure of US patents by about 1.5 years. We obtain causal estimates by comparing US patents subject to AIPA with “twin” European patents that were not. Post-AIPA, US patents receive more and faster follow-on citations, indicating greater technology diffusion. Technological overlap increases between distant but related patents and decreases between highly similar patents, and patent applications are less likely to be abandoned, suggesting less duplicative R&D. Publicly listed firms exposed to 1 standard deviation longer patent grant delays increased R&D by 4% post-AIPA.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723636

Pareto-improving policies require a gradual reform: labor taxes should be cut, and capital taxes should remain high for a long time before reaching the limit. This policy redistributes wealth in favor of workers, promotes growth, and causes early deficits and government debt in the long run. We address several technical issues, such as sufficiency of Lagrangian solutions in a Ramsey problem, their relation to welfare functions, and solution algorithms.

Default episodes lead to haircuts for lenders but not to reductions in debt, because the defaulted debt accumulates and borrowing continues. We present a theory of partial default rationalizing these patterns and the heterogeneity of partial default, and partial default’s comovements with spreads, debt, and output that are absent in standard sovereign default theory.

Journal of Political Economy,2023,The Equilibrium Existence Duality,"Elizabeth Baldwin, Ravi Jagadeesan, Paul Klemperer and Alexander Teytelboym","We show that with indivisible goods, the existence of competitive equilibrium fundamentally depends on agents’ substitution effects, not their income effects. Our equilibrium existence duality allows us to transport results on the existence of competitive equilibrium from settings with transferable utility to settings with income effects. One consequence is that net substitutability—which is a strictly weaker condition than gross substitutability—is sufficient for the existence of competitive equilibrium. Further applications give new existence results beyond the case of (net) substitutes. Our results have implications for auction design.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722935
Journal of Political Economy,2023,The Lasting Effects of Early-Childhood Education on Promoting the Skills and Social Mobility of Disadvantaged African Americans and Their Children,"Jorge Luis Garcia, James Heckman and Victor Ronda","This paper demonstrates the long-term intra- and intergenerational benefits of the HighScope Perry Preschool Project, which targeted disadvantaged African American children. We use newly collected data on the original participants through late middle age and on their children into their midtwenties. We document long-lasting improvements in the original participants’ skills, marriage stability, earnings, criminal behavior, and health. Beneficial program impacts through the child-rearing years translate into better family environments for their children, leading to intergenerational gains. Children of the original participants have higher levels of education and employment, lower levels of criminal activity, and better health than children of the controls.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722936
Journal of Political Economy,2023,The Mainstreaming of Marx: Measuring the Effect of the Russian Revolution on Karl Marx’s Influence,Phillip W. Magness and Michael Makovi,"Karl Marx’s high academic stature outside of economics diverges sharply from his peripheral influence within the discipline, particularly after nineteenth-century developments rendered the labor theory of value obsolete. We hypothesize that the 1917 Russian Revolution is responsible for elevating Marx into the academic mainstream. Using the synthetic control method, we construct a counterfactual for Marx’s citation patterns in Google Ngram data. This allows us to predict how often Marx would have been cited if the Russian Revolution had not happened. We find a significant treatment effect, meaning that Marx’s academic stature today owes a substantial debt to political happenstance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722933
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Pareto-Improving Segmentation of Multiproduct Markets,Nima Haghpanah and Ron Siegel,"We investigate whether a market served by a multiproduct monopolistic seller can be segmented in a way that benefits all consumers and the seller. The seller can offer a different product menu in each market segment, combining second- and third-degree price discrimination. We show that markets for which profit maximization leads to inefficiency can, generically, be segmented into two market segments in a way that increases the surplus of all consumers weakly and of some consumers and the seller strictly. Our constructive proof is based on deriving implications of binding incentive compatibility constraints when profit maximization implies inefficiency.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722932
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Voluntary Interaction and the Principle of Mutual Benefit,"Andrea Isoni, Robert Sugden and Jiwei Zheng","Most social preference theories are based on observations of nonvoluntary interactions. Nonselfish behavior may take fundamentally different forms in voluntary interactions, such as market transactions. We investigate the “Principle of Mutual Benefit”—an injunctive norm requiring individuals who enter interactions voluntarily to conform to common expectations about behavior within them. This norm induces patterns of behavior inconsistent with existing social preference theories and allows extrinsic incentives to crowd in trustworthiness. We embed this norm in a model consistent with evidence about promise keeping, gift exchange, and “avoiding the ask.” We present new experimental evidence that people adhere to it.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722930

We provide a tractable characterization of the identified set under various classes of nonparametric distributional assumptions on the unobserved heterogeneity. We reexamine some of the relevant questions in the empirical literature on the marriage market, which have been previously studied under the logit assumption. Our results reveal that many findings in the aforementioned literature are primarily driven by such parametric restrictions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722415
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Asset Safety versus Asset Liquidity,"Athanasios Geromichalos, Lucas Herrenbrueck and Sukjoon Lee","Many economists assume that safer assets are more liquid, and some have practically used “safe” and “liquid” as synonyms. But these terms are not synonyms, and mixing them up can lead to confusion and wrong policy recommendations. We build a multiasset model where an asset’s safety and liquidity are well defined and distinct, and we examine their relationship in general equilibrium. We show that the common belief that “safety implies liquidity” is generally justified but also identify conditions under which this relationship can be reversed. We use our model to rationalize, qualitatively and quantitatively, a prominent safety-liquidity reversal observed in the data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722225

If banks have market power in the deposit market, a CBDC can enhance competition, raising the deposit rate, expanding intermediation, and increasing output. A calibration to the US economy suggests that a CBDC can raise bank lending by 1.57% and output by 0.19%. These crowding-in effects remain robust, albeit with smaller magnitudes, after taking into account endogenous bank entry. We also assess the role of a non-interest-bearing CBDC as the use of cash declines.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722517

We find, first, that inequality in income and especially wealth dramatically overstates inequality in spending power. Second, inequality in current spending power differs from that in lifetime spending power because of credit constraints, in-kind government benefits, and other factors. Third, the US fiscal system is highly progressive once cohorts are old enough to have highly dispersed human wealth. Fourth, households’ rankings based on current income can differ substantially from their rankings based on lifetime resources. Fifth, current-year net tax rates substantially understate fiscal progressivity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722394

Firm-level variation in common ownership causes variation in managerial incentives and productivity across firms, which leads to intraindustry and intrafirm cross-market variation in prices, output, markups, and market shares that is consistent with empirical evidence. The organizational structure of multiproduct firms and the passivity of common owners determine whether higher prices under common ownership result from higher costs or from higher markups. Using panel regressions and a difference-in-differences design, we document that managerial incentives are less performance sensitive in firms with more common ownership.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722414

Journal of Political Economy,2023,Heterogeneity and Asset Prices: An Intergenerational Approach,Nicolae Gârleanu and Stavros Panageas,"In an overlapping-generations economy, the consumption growth of a given cohort member (the “marginal agent”) differs from the aggregate consumption growth. A cohort member is faced with long-run consumption uncertainty even in the absence of aggregate (and within-cohort) consumption risk. This uncertainty allows the model to account for several stylized asset-pricing facts (high market price of risk and volatility, return predictability, low and nonvolatile interest rate) despite deterministic macroeconomic aggregates and inequality measures that are contemporaneously uncorrelated with asset returns. We devise and implement a methodology to measure the marginal agent’s consumption growth and evaluate the model’s quantitative implications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722224

Yet few studies link life outcomes with names using observational data. We use administrative data from over 3 million Black students to ask whether those with more statistically Black names have differential educational outcomes.

The agents in our model are replaced occasionally, and each person updates beliefs in response to observed outcomes.

Yet evidence on its effect on Black office holding remains scant. Using novel data on Black elected officials between 1962 and 1980, we assess the impact of the Voting Rights Act on the racial makeup of local governments in the Deep South. Exploiting predetermined differential exposure of Southern counties to the mandated federal intervention, we show that the latter fostered local Black office holding, particularly in the powerful county commissions, controlling local public finances. In the presence of election by district, covered counties experienced Black representation gains and faster capital spending growth.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722092

We use test score and non–test score measures of student achievement and behavior to estimate multiple dimensions of teacher quality. We find that these two measures of teacher quality are only weakly correlated and that both affect students’ high school performance. A teacher removal simulation that uses both measures improves most long-term student outcomes by over 50%, compared to a policy that uses test scores alone. Our results also show that for high school outcomes the effects of teachers in later grades are larger than those in earlier grades and that performance in core elementary school subjects matters more than that in other subjects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722227
Journal of Political Economy,2023,Risk-Sharing Externalities,Luigi Bocola and Guido Lorenzoni,"Financial crises typically occur because firms and financial institutions are highly exposed to aggregate shocks. We propose a theory to explain these exposures. We study a model where entrepreneurs can issue state-contingent claims to consumers. Even though entrepreneurs can use these instruments to hedge negative shocks, they do not necessarily do so because insuring against these shocks is expensive, as consumers are also harmed by them. This effect is self-reinforcing because riskier balance sheets for entrepreneurs imply higher income volatility for the consumers, making insurance more costly in equilibrium. We show that this feedback is quantitatively important and leads to inefficiently high risk exposure for entrepreneurs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722088

Measuring the Direct and Overall Effects of a Management Practice,"Guido Friebel, Matthias Heinz, Mitchell Hoffman and Nick Zubanov","Employee referral programs (ERPs) are randomly introduced in a grocery chain. On direct effects, larger referral bonuses increase referral quantity but decrease quality, though the increase in referrals from ERPs is modest. However, the overall effect of having an ERP is substantial, reducing attrition by 15% and significantly decreasing labor costs. This occurs, partly, because referrals stay longer than nonreferrals, but, mainly, from indirect effects: nonreferrals stay longer in treated than in control stores. The most supported mechanism for these indirect effects is workers value being involved in hiring. Attrition impacts are larger in higher performing stores and better local labor markets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/721735

When agents are heterogeneous with respect to both preferences and other aspects of cognition, we show that these two determinants of behavior are identified simultaneously by suitable mixture choice data.

We provide a novel progressive structure for the heterogeneous types to capture heterogeneity due to varying levels of a behavioral trait. Given an order of alternatives, our progressive structure sorts the types by the extent to which they align with this order. Unlike the random-utility model, our model uniquely identifies the heterogeneity, allowing policy makers to perform an improved welfare analysis. As a showcase, we provide characterization of a well-studied type of bounded rationality: “less-is-more.” In addition, we provide conditions for unique identification of the underlying order for the less-is-more structure.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/721732

We study parents’ competitiveness choices for their children by combining two large-scale artifactual field experiments with high-quality longitudinal administrative data. We document three main sets of findings. First, parents choose more competition for their sons than daughters. Second, this gender difference can largely be explained by parents’ beliefs about their children’s competitiveness preferences. Third, parents’ choices predict children’s later-in-life educational outcomes. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence on the role of parents in shaping children’s long-term outcomes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/721801

A mechanism is informationally simple if agents have no incentive to learn about others’ preferences. This property is of interest for two reasons. First, it is a necessary condition for the existence of dominant-strategy equilibria in the extended game. Second, this endogenizes an “independent-private-value” property of the interim information structure. We show that, generically, a mechanism is informationally simple if and only if it satisfies a separability condition that rules out most economically meaningful mechanisms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722089

We revisit this finding, constructing improved measures of consumption, focusing on its well-measured components that are reported at a high and stable rate relative to national accounts. While overall income inequality rose over the past 5 decades, the rise in overall consumption inequality was small. The declining quality of income data likely contributes to these differences for the bottom of the distribution.

Additionally, the principal privately observes a signal correlated with the agent’s type. Transparent mechanisms are optimal: the principal’s payoff is the same as if her signal was public. A simple cutoff form is optimal: favorable signals ensure the agent’s preferred action. Signals below this cutoff lead to the nonpreferred action unless the agent appeals.

We find that industrialization occurred in areas that began with low wages but high mechanical skills, whereas other variables, such as literacy, banks, and proximity to coal, have little explanatory power.
