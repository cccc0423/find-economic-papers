American Economic Review,2025,International Trade Responses to Labor Market Regulations,Mathilde Muñoz,"This paper demonstrates that labor market regulations, such as minimum wages or payroll taxes, shape trade competition in labor-intensive activities. I exploit data from a large European trade program where firms from different countries supply labor services at the same location but face different payroll taxes and minimum wage rules. Country case studies and model-consistent gravity estimates show large trade responses to tax and regulatory reforms, with an elasticity of trade in services to labor costs larger than one. The results imply that absent regulatory and fiscal harmonization, export competitiveness depends, in part, on domestic labor market policies.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231531
American Economic Review,2025,Just a Few Seeds More: The Value of Network Data for Diffusion,"Mohammad Akbarpour, Suraj Malladi and Amin Saberi","Identifying the optimal set of individuals to first receive information (""seeds"") in a social network to maximize expected diffusion is a widely studied question in many settings. Several studies propose network-centrality-based heuristics to select seeds likely to increase diffusion. Here, we show that, for the classic independent cascade model of diffusion, either seeding a few more individuals at random can prompt a larger diffusion than optimal seeding or optimal seeding itself results in limited spread. These findings hold across a broad range of random networks and are supported by simulations on real-world networks.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20180798
American Economic Review,2025,Default Options and Retirement Saving Dynamics,Taha Choukhmane,"Using data from over 100 US retirement plans and a representative UK panel, I document the impact of auto-enrollment (AE) on retirement savings at different horizons. I replicate the impact of AE on participation and contributions in the short run (at 12 months), but I show that these gains are attenuated over the medium run (at 36 months). At this longer horizon, the average savings increases are modest, though AE significantly lowers inequality in savings. To assess AE's lifetime impact, I estimate a life cycle consumption-savings model that can fit the observed patterns with a switching cost of approximately $250, smaller than previous estimates.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210881
American Economic Review,2025,"A Preferred-Habitat Model of Term Premia, Exchange Rates, and Monetary Policy Spillovers","Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Walker Ray and Dimitri Vayanos","We develop a two-country model in which currency and bond markets are populated by different investor clienteles, and segmentation is partly overcome by arbitrageurs with limited capital. Risk premia in our model are time-varying, connected across markets, and consistent with the empirical violations of uncovered interest parity and expectations hypothesis. Through risk premia, large-scale bond purchases lower domestic and foreign bond yields and depreciate the currency, and short-rate cuts lower foreign yields, with smaller effects than bond purchases. Currency returns are disconnected from long-maturity bond returns, and yet the currency market is instrumental in transmitting bond demand shocks across countries.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220379
American Economic Review,2025,"Quid Pro Quo, Knowledge Spillovers, and Industrial Quality Upgrading: Evidence from the Chinese Auto Industry","Jie Bai, Panle Jia Barwick, Shengmao Cao and Shanjun Li","This paper studies the impact of quid pro quo (technology for market access) in facilitating knowledge spillovers and quality upgrading in the Chinese automobile industry. The identification strategy exploits within-product quality variation across a rich set of quality dimensions. We find affiliated domestic automakers adopt more similar quality strengths of their joint venture partners, consistent with knowledge spillovers. Additional analysis suggests worker flows and supplier networks mediate knowledge spillovers. Knowledge spillovers due to ownership affiliation under quid pro quo contributed 8.3 percent of the quality improvement experienced by affiliated domestic models from 2001 to 2014, relative to nonaffiliated domestic models.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221501
American Economic Review,2025,Nonlinear Pricing and Misallocation,Gideon Bornstein and Alessandra Peter,"This paper studies the effect of nonlinear pricing on markups and misallocation. In a general equilibrium model in which firms are allowed to set a quantity-dependent pricing schedule, markup heterogeneity is not a sign of misallocation. Instead, we point to a new source of misallocation: high-taste consumers are allocated too much of each good, low-taste consumers too little. Using micro data from the retail sector, we show that nonlinear pricing is prevalent and quantify the model. Welfare losses from misallocation across consumers are substantially larger than those from misallocation across firms under linear pricing.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230168
American Economic Review,2025,Borrowing and Spending in the Money: Debt Substitution and the Cash-Out Refinance Channel of Monetary Policy,"Elliot Anenberg, Tess Scharlemann and Eileen  van Straelen","We show that the strong negative effect of higher mortgage rates on cash-out refinancing reflects substitution into other borrowing products, not large changes in total new household borrowing. We exploit plausibly exogenous changes in interest rates due to unconventional monetary policy surprises to show that changes in cash-out and other borrowing are roughly offsetting. The elasticity of new household borrowing with respect to mortgage rates is low and varies little with the borrower's outstanding mortgage rate. Our results suggest that the cash-out refinance channel of unconventional monetary policy is weak and not path dependent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231264
American Economic Review,2025,Anatomy of the Phillips Curve: Micro Evidence and Macro Implications,"Luca Gagliardone, Mark Gertler, Simone Lenzu and Joris Tielens","We develop a bottom-up approach to estimate the slope of the primitive form of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, which features marginal cost as the real activity variable. Using quarterly micro data on prices, costs, and output, we estimate dynamic pass-through regressions that identify the slope as a function of primitive parameters. We find a high slope for the cost-based Phillips curve, which contrasts with the low estimates of the conventional output gap–based formulation found in the literature. We reconcile by showing that the output elasticity of marginal cost is low, at least during moderate inflation periods (e.g., pre-pandemic).",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231569
American Economic Review,2025,The Trade-Off between Flexibility and Robustness in Instrumental Variables Analysis,Ben Deaner,"In additive instrumental variables models, the robustness to some failure of instrumental validity or additive separability depends on the strength of a priori restrictions on the structural relationship between outcomes and treatments.

American Economic Review,2025,Distinguishing Causes of Neighborhood Racial Change: A Nearest-Neighbor Design,"Patrick Bayer, Marcus Casey, W. Ben McCartney, John Orellana-Li and Calvin Zhang","We study neighborhood choice using a novel research design that contrasts the move rate of homeowners who receive a new different-race neighbor immediately next-door versus slightly farther away on the same block. This approach isolates a component of preferences directly attributable to neighbors' identities. Both Black and White homeowners are more likely to move after receiving a new different-race neighbor. Findings are robust to additional controls (e.g., income) and alternative research designs. We find evidence of heterogeneity in responses, especially associated with housing density, which has implications for understanding contemporary neighborhood racial change and prospects for maintaining stable, integrated neighborhoods.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240406
American Economic Review,2025,Managers and Public Hospital Performance,Pablo Muñoz and Cristóbal Otero,"We study whether the quality of managers can affect public service provision in the context of public health. Using novel data from public hospitals in Chile, we show how the introduction of a competitive recruitment system and better pay for public hospital CEOs reduced hospital mortality by 8 percent. The effect is not explained by a change in patient composition. We find that the policy changed the pool of CEOs by displacing doctors with no management training in favor of CEOs who had studied management. Productivity improvements were driven by hospitals that recruited higher quality CEOs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240615
American Economic Review,2025,Increasing Degree Attainment among Low-Income Students: The Role of Intensive Advising and College Quality,Andrew Barr and Benjamin Castleman,"A college degree offers a pathway to economic mobility for low-income students. Using a multisite randomized controlled trial combined with administrative and survey data, we demonstrate that intensive advising during high school and college significantly increases bachelor's degree attainment among lower-income students. We leverage unique data on preadvising college preferences and causal forest methods to show that these gains are primarily driven by improvements in initial enrollment quality. Our results suggest that strategies targeting college choice may be a more effective and efficient means of increasing degree attainment than those focused solely on affordability.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240669
American Economic Review,2025,Treatment Effects in Market Equilibrium,"Evan Munro, Xu Kuang and Stefan Wager","Policy-relevant treatment effect estimation in a marketplace setting requires assessing both the direct treatment benefit and spillovers induced by changes to the market equilibrium. We show how to identify and estimate policy-relevant treatment effects using a unit-randomized trial run within a single large market. A Bernoulli-randomized trial allows consistent estimation of direct effects and of treatment-heterogeneity measures that enable welfare-improving targeting. Estimating spillovers—and providing confidence intervals for the direct effect—requires estimates of price elasticities, which we provide using an augmented experimental design. We illustrate our results using a simulation calibrated to a conditional cash-transfer experiment in the Philippines.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230039

We allow for competing risks, observable characteristics, and censoring. We prove our estimator is consistent and apply it to the duration of price spells.

American Economic Review,2025,Politics at Work,"Emanuele Colonnelli, Valdemar Pinho Neto and Edoardo Teso","We study how individual political views shape firm behavior and labor market outcomes using new microdata from Brazil. We first show that business owners are considerably more likely to employ copartisan workers. This phenomenon is in part driven by the overlapping of political and social networks. Multiple tests—surveys, event studies, analyses of wage premia and promotions within the firm, and a field experiment—further highlight how business owners' political preferences directly influence firms' employment decisions. A channel of political discrimination appears more relevant than one of political quid pro quo between firms and politicians.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240151
American Economic Review,2025,Place-Based Redistribution,"Cecile Gaubert, Patrick Kline, Damian Vergara and Danny Yagan","We study optimal income taxation in a spatial equilibrium model with heterogeneous locational preferences, labor supply decisions, and competitive housing and labor markets. Expressions characterizing the optimal tax schedule in each community are provided that capture the fiscal externalities associated with migration and the effects of redistribution between households and landlords. Correlation between skill and locational preferences yields optimal transfers to poor areas, while sorting based on comparative advantage can motivate transfers in either direction. A calibration to areas targeted by the US Empowerment Zone program yields sizable optimal spatial transfers that are sensitive to assumed levels of migration responsiveness.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20202067
American Economic Review,2025,Monetary Policy and the Labor Market: A Quasi-experiment in Sweden,"John Coglianese, Maria Olsson and Christina Patterson","We analyze a monetary quasi-experiment in Sweden from 2010–2011, when the Riksbank raised the interest rate substantially. We argue that this increase was beyond what labor market conditions warranted, driven instead by new concerns about financial stability. Using a battery of specifications that rule out domestic or international confounders, we show that this monetary tightening led to a substantial economic contraction, raising unemployment by 1–2 percentage points. Using administrative microdata, we find that sectors with nominal wage rigidity drove much of the response and that the monetary contraction was more regressive than the typical business cycle.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231167

We leverage random assignment to estimate effects during and after the pandemic (2020 and 2022), investigating channels of impact. Three hours of individual tutoring per week increased math performance by 0.22 SD in 2020 and 0.20 SD in 2022. Higher dosage yielded stronger effects, while group tutoring smaller effects. TOP enhanced students' aspirations, socioemotional skills, and psychological well-being, but only during school closures.

Our findings are consistent with Bayesian investors gradually learning about software's growing importance, highlighting how markets can be very slow to discern fundamental shifts from transient shocks in noisy data.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230463
American Economic Review,2025,Do Credit Conditions Move House Prices?,Daniel L. Greenwald and Adam Guren,"Did credit drive the 2000s housing cycle? The existing literature's findings range from credit having no effect to credit explaining most of the cycle. We show that these disparate results hinge on the extent to which landlords absorb credit-driven demand, which depends on the degree of housing market segmentation. We develop a model that nests cases between the extremes of no segmentation and perfect segmentation typically considered, estimate an elasticity that pins down the degree of segmentation, and use it to calibrate our model. We find credit standards played an important role, explaining 32 percent to 53 percent of the boom.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211715
American Economic Review,2025,Diffusion of Reproductive Health Behavior through International Migration: Effects on Origin-Country Fertility,Susan Godlonton and Caroline Theoharides,"International migrants may facilitate the transmission of ideas across countries. We examine the impact of migrant exposure to reproductive health policies on origin-country fertility in the Philippines. We exploit temporal variation in destination-country reproductive health policies combined with spatial variation across Philippine provinces in their migration intensity and historical composition of migrant destinations. Migrant exposure to more liberalized reproductive health policies reduces origin-community fertility. This reduction is driven by increased adoption of modern contraceptives. Visible policy changes, such as commercial advertising of contraceptives, lead to this change in behavior. Firmly established family planning values moderate the fertility response.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231286
American Economic Review,2025,"Intermediated Asymmetric Information, Compensation, and Career Prospects",Ron Kaniel and Dmitry Orlov,"Adverse selection benefits firms able to identify talent. An informed intermediary expropriates agents' ability by threatening to fire and expose them to undervaluation of their skill. An agent's track record gradually reduces intermediary's information advantage. In response, the intermediary starts churning well-performing agents she knows are less skilled. The accelerated reduction in information advantage boosts profits, as retained agents accept below-reservation wages to build reputation faster. Agents prefer starting their careers working for an intermediary, as benefits from building reputation faster more than offset expropriation costs. Our analysis applies to professions where talent is essential and performance is publicly observable.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20200169
American Economic Review,2025,Micro versus Macro Labor Supply Elasticities: The Role of Dynamic Returns to Effort,"Henrik Kleven, Claus Kreiner, Kristian Larsen and Jakob Søgaard","We investigate long-run earnings responses to taxes in the presence of dynamic returns to effort. First, we develop a theoretical model of earnings determination with dynamic returns to effort. In this model, earnings responses are delayed and mediated by job switches. Second, using administrative data from Denmark, we verify our model's predictions about earnings and hours-worked patterns over the life cycle. Third, we provide a quasi-experimental analysis of long-run earnings elasticities. Informed by our model, the empirical strategy exploits variation among job switchers. We find that the long-run elasticity is around 0.5, considerably larger than the short-run elasticity of roughly 0.2.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240554

Our results demonstrate that public R&D conducted by NASA contractors increased manufacturing value added, employment, and capital accumulation in space-related sectors.

American Economic Review,2025,Imperfect Competition and Rents in Labor and Product Markets: The Case of the Construction Industry,"Kory Kroft, Yao Luo, Magne Mogstad and Bradley Setzler","We develop, identify, and estimate a model of imperfect competition in both labor and product markets. Our context is the US construction industry, where firms compete for workers, private market projects, and government procurements. Our empirical approach leverages bidding data from procurement auctions linked to employer-employee tax records. We find imperfect competition in both markets generates a total wage markdown of more than 30 percent and a total price markup of around 45 percent. By contrast, if one erroneously assumed a perfectly competitive product (labor) market, then one would conclude wages (prices) are marked down (up) by only 20 percent (16 percent).",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220577

We study when nested bundling is optimal and determine which nested menu is optimal, when consumers differ in one dimension. We define a partial order on bundles by (i) set inclusion and (ii) sales quantity when sold alone. We show that, under quasi-concavity assumptions, if the undominated bundles with respect to this partial order are nested, then nested bundling is optimal. We present an iterative algorithm that identifies the minimal optimal menu consisting of a subset of the undominated bundles.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230455
American Economic Review,2025,"Labor Market Power, Self-Employment, and Development","Francesco Amodio, Pamela Medina and Monica Morlacco","This paper shows that self-employment shapes labor market power in low-income countries, with implications for industrial development. Using Peruvian data, we find that wage-setting power increases with employer concentration but less so where self-employment is more prevalent. A general equilibrium model shows that in oligopsonistic labor markets, self-employment raises the supply elasticity of wage labor, weakening employer market power. However, by the same mechanism, procompetitive policies aimed at expanding wage employment and reducing reliance on self-employment may unintentionally strengthen labor market power, undermining their objectives.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230490
American Economic Review,2025,Is Air Pollution Regulation Too Lenient? Evidence from US Offset Markets,Joseph Shapiro and Reed Walker,"We develop a framework to estimate the marginal cost of air pollution regulation and apply it to assess policy efficiency. We exploit a provision of the Clean Air Act that requires new plants to pay incumbent facilities to reduce emissions. This ""offset"" policy creates hundreds of local pollution markets, differing by pollutant and location. Theory and transaction data suggest that offset prices reveal marginal abatement costs. We compare these prices to marginal benefits of pollution reduction estimated using leading air quality models and find that, on average, marginal benefits exceed marginal costs by more than a factor of ten.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230761

A frequent claim is that by not seeing standardized test scores, a college can admit a student body it prefers, say, with more diversity. But how can observing less information improve decisions? This paper proposes that test-optional policies are a response to social pressure on admission decisions. We model a college that bears disutility when it makes admission decisions that ""society"" dislikes. Going test optional allows the college to reduce its ""disagreement cost.""

American Economic Review,2025,Market-Wide Predictable Price Pressure,Samuel M. Hartzmark and David H.

Buying pressure from dividend payments (announced weeks prior) predicts higher value-weighted market returns, with returns for the top quintile of payment days four times higher than the lowest. This holds internationally and increases when reinvestment is high and market liquidity is low. We estimate a market-level price multiplier of 1.9.

American Economic Review,2025,A Model of Populism as a Conspiracy Theory,Adam Szeidl and Ferenc Szucs,"We model populism as the dissemination of a false ""alternative reality,"" according to which the intellectual elite conspires against the populist for purely ideological reasons. If enough voters are receptive to it, this alternative reality—by discrediting the elite's truthful message—reduces political accountability. Elite criticism, because it is more consistent with the alternative reality, strengthens receptive voters' support for the populist. Alternative realities are endogenously conspiratorial to resist evidence better. Populists, to leverage or strengthen beliefs in the alternative reality, enact harmful policies that may disproportionately harm the non-elite. These results explain previously unexplained facts about populism.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240010

Treated women are 41 percent more likely to be employed yet are 19 percent less likely to be able to make purchases without family permission. Patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects reveal that these divergent impacts of access to driving are experienced by distinct subgroups of women.

Low-wage workers are less likely to claim and more likely to have their claims appealed than median-wage workers.

We do not find support for this hypothesis. Women who were given free access to modern contraception for three years did not have lower birth rates; we can reject even modest effects.

Restorative practices (RP)—focusing on reparation, accountability, and shared ownership of disciplinary justice—are designed to address undesirable behavior without harming students. We study Chicago Public Schools' adoption of RP and find that suspensions and arrests decreased, driven by effects for Black students. We find null effects on test score value added, ruling out meaningful average declines.

American Economic Review,2025,Direct and Indirect Effects of Investment Tax Incentives,Adrian Lerche,"This paper estimates the direct effects and indirect spillover effects of investment tax credits on firms. Exploiting a differential tax credit rate change by firm size in the German manufacturing sector, I find that lowering a firm's investment cost by 7.6 percent increases its capital stock by 17.7 percent and employment by 12.0 percent. Positive local spillovers generate one additional manufacturing job for each directly created job, are strongest between firms in industries connected through input-output linkages, and arise within distances of five kilometers. Firms dependent on local consumer demand also increase employment, while within-industry spillovers generate small negative effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220656
American Economic Review,2025,Monetary Policy and Rational Asset Price Bubbles: Comment,"Franklin Allen, Gadi Barlevy and Douglas Gale","Galí (2014) showed that a monetary policy rule that raises rates when bubbles exceed some steady-state benchmark can paradoxically lead to larger deviations from steady state. Nevertheless, this comment shows that a central bank can always dampen a bubble by setting a higher-than-expected rate, although it may have to raise the rate aggressively. This is a different point from the Miao, Shen, and Wang (2019) comment on Galí (2014). They showed that when the central bank targets a different steady state than Gali considered, raising rates when bubbles exceed this alternative benchmark leads to smaller deviations from steady state.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230983
American Economic Review,2025,The Debt-Inflation Channel of the German (Hyper) Inflation,"Markus Brunnermeier, Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, Emil Verner and Tom Zimmermann","This paper studies how a large increase in the price level is transmitted to the real economy through firm balance sheets. Using newly digitized macro- and micro-level data from the German inflation of 1919–1923, we show that inflation led to a large reduction in real debt burdens and bankruptcies. Firms with higher nominal liabilities at the onset of inflation experienced a larger decline in interest expenses, a relative increase in their equity values, and higher employment during the inflation. The results are consistent with real effects of a debt-inflation channel that operates even when prices and wages are flexible.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230685

This deterioration primarily reflects a US-specific rise in corporate asset values that inflated the value of US equity liabilities to the rest of the world. To interpret these trends, we develop an international macro-finance model of flows, stocks, asset valuations, the current account,and the net foreign asset position.

In a novel approach, the Chilean government randomized the introduction of the program for children living in institutions to evaluate effects on child well-being.

The framework is centered around a utility-technology possibilities frontier, which delineates the possible distributions of resources in a society both for given technology and working via different technological choices. It highlights how various types of institutions, market structures, norms, and ideologies influence moves along the frontier and shifts of the frontier, and it provides a simple formalization of the social forces that lead to institutional persistence and those that can trigger institutional change. The framework also enables us to conceptualize how, during periods of disruption, existing—and sometimes quite small—differences can have amplified effects on prosperity and institutional trajectories. In this way, it suggests some parallels between different disruptive periods, including the onset of European colonialism, the spread (or lack thereof) of industrial technologies in the nineteenth century, and decisions related to the use, adoption, and development of AI today.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.115.6.1709

These distinctions are critical because they create very different challenges in trying to make institutions more inclusive and create prosperity. I show how countries move from the economic periphery as a consequence of changing both.

American Economic Review,2025,The Decline of Too Big to Fail,"Antje Berndt, Darrell Duffie and Yichao Zhu","For globally systemically important banks (GSIBs) with US headquarters, we find significant reductions in market-implied probabilities of government bailout after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), along with roughly 170 percent higher wholesale debt financing costs for these banks after controlling for insolvency risk. Since the GFC, bank creditors appear to expect much larger losses in the event that a GSIB approaches insolvency. In this sense, we estimate a decline of ""too big to fail.""",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220846
American Economic Review,2025,"How Competitive Is the Stock Market? Theory, Evidence from Portfolios, and Implications for the Rise of Passive Investing","Valentin Haddad, Paul Huebner and Erik Loualiche","The conventional wisdom in finance is that competition is fierce among investors: if a group changes its behavior, others adjust their strategies such that nothing happens to prices. We estimate a demand system with flexible strategic responses for institutional investors in the US stock market. When less aggressive traders surround an investor, she adjusts by trading more aggressively. However, this strategic reaction only counteracts two-thirds of the impact of the initial change in behavior. In light of these estimates, the rise in passive investing over the last 20 years has made the demand for individual stocks 11 percent more inelastic.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230505
American Economic Review,2025,Corruption as a Local Advantage: Evidence from the Indigenization of Nigerian Oil,Jonah M. Rexer,"Multinationals in the extractive sectors of weak states face resource theft by armed groups. Criminality is often abetted by state corruption, even though firms are willing to pay for protection. I study indigenization in Nigeria's oil sector, which increased local firms' participation substantially. Despite lower quality, local firms increase output by reducing oil theft. A bargaining model illustrates that political connections align law enforcement incentives, solving commitment problems. Data on law enforcement raids show that local firms receive preferential protection. Connections to military elites drive the local advantage. The aggregate gains from indigenization are at most between 2.3 and 5.7 percent of GDP.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220528
American Economic Review,2025,Empowering Adolescents to Transform Schools: Lessons from a Behavioral Targeting,Sule Alan and Elif Kubilay,"We test the effectiveness of a behavioral program grounded in the idea that status granting and self-persuasion might yield a robust behavioral change in disadvantaged adolescents. We enlist socially connected senior middle school students with high emotional intelligence as ""student-teachers"" and entrust them with delivering a curriculum to their junior peers. The program empowers student-teachers, leading them to improve their social environment. It reduces disciplinary incidents and antisocial behavior among student-teachers and their friendship networks. The intervention significantly enhances the likelihood of admission to selective high schools for student-teachers, offering a cost-effective way to help disadvantaged adolescents escape neighborhood disadvantages.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240374
American Economic Review,2025,Regulating Conglomerates: Evidence from an Energy Conservation Program in China,"Qiaoyi Chen, Zhao Chen, Zhikuo Liu, Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato and Yi Xu","We study a prominent energy regulation affecting large Chinese manufacturers that are part of broader conglomerates. Using detailed firm-level data and difference-in-differences research designs, we show that regulated firms cut output and shifted some production to unregulated firms within their conglomerate instead of improving their energy efficiency. To account for conglomerate and market spillovers, we interpret these results through the lens of an industry equilibrium model featuring conglomerate production. The policy raises welfare if the per ton benefits of carbon reduction exceed $161. Alternative policies that exploit public information on business networks can increase aggregate energy savings by 10 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211455
American Economic Review,2025,A Theory of Dynamic Inflation Targets,Christopher Clayton and Andreas Schaab,Should central banks' inflation targets remain set in stone? We study a dynamic mechanism design problem between a government and a central bank. The central bank has persistent private information about structural shocks. Firms learn the state from the central bank's reports and form inflation expectations. A dynamic inflation target implements the full-information commitment allocation. The central bank is delegated the authority to adjust the target's level and flexibility one period in advance. A declining natural interest rate and a flattening Phillips curve imply opposite optimal target adjustments. Our results speak to practical policy questions of inflation target design.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230496
American Economic Review,2025,Sticky Wages on the Layoff Margin,Steven Davis and Pawel Krolikowski,"We design and field an innovative survey of unemployment insurance (UI) recipients that yields new insights about wage stickiness on the layoff margin. A majority of UI recipients would accept pay cuts of 5–10 percent to save their jobs, and one-third would accept a 25 percent cut. Yet worker-employer discussions about cuts in pay, benefits, or hours in lieu of layoffs are exceedingly rare. Roughly one-quarter of the layoffs in our sample violate the theoretical condition for bilaterally efficient separations. We draw on our findings and other evidence to assess theories of wage stickiness and its role in layoffs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20240309
American Economic Review,2025,The Good Wife? Reputation Dynamics and Financial Decision-Making inside the Household,"Nina Buchmann, Pascaline Dupas and Roberta Ziparo",We study reputation dynamics within the household in a setting where women regularly receive transfers from their husbands for household purchases. We propose a signaling model in which wives try to maintain a good reputation in the eyes of their husbands to receive high transfers. This leads them to (i) avoid risky purchases (goods with unknown returns) and (ii) knowingly overuse low-return goods to hide bad purchase decisions—we call this the intrahousehold sunk cost effect. We present supportive evidence for the model from a series of experiments with married couples in rural Malawi.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230393
American Economic Review,2025,Hedging When Applying: Simultaneous Search with Correlation,S. Nageeb Ali and Ran I. Shorrer,"Applicants to schools, colleges, and jobs hedge by applying to a broad range of options, including reaches, matches, and safeties. We develop a simultaneous-search framework that rationalizes this practice. In this framework, the admissions process is correlated across schools so that if an applicant is rejected by one school, she is more likely to be rejected by more selective schools. We find that an applicant then optimally targets both safeties and reaches. We characterize how the optimal portfolio varies with the applicant's beliefs, risk attitudes, and application costs and offer an algorithm that delivers the optimal portfolio in polynomial time.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211137
American Economic Review,2025,Robust Monopoly Regulation,Yingni Guo and Eran Shmaya,"We study how to regulate a monopolistic firm using a robust-design, non-Bayesian approach. We derive a policy that minimizes the regulator's worst-case regret, where regret is the difference between the regulator's complete-information payoff and his realized payoff. When the regulator's payoff is consumers' surplus, he caps the firm's average revenue. When his payoff is the total surplus of both consumers and the firm, he offers a piece rate subsidy to the firm while capping the total subsidy. For intermediate cases, the regulator combines these three policy instruments to balance three goals: protecting consumers' surplus, mitigating underproduction, and limiting potential overproduction.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20191950
American Economic Review,2025,Political Social Learning: Short-Term Memory and Cycles of Polarization,Gilat Levy and Ronny Razin,"This paper investigates the effect of voters' short-term memory on political outcomes by considering politics as a collective learning process. We find that short-term memory may lead to cycles of polarization and consensus across parties' platforms. Following periods of party consensus, short-term memory implies that there is little variation in voters' data and therefore limited information about the true state of the world. This in turn allows parties to further their own interests and hence polarize by offering different policies. In contrast, periods of polarization and turnover involve sufficient variation in the data that allows voters to be confident about what the correct policy is, forcing both parties to offer this policy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220226
American Economic Review,2025,The Benefits of Revealing Race: Evidence from Minority-Owned Local Businesses,"Abhay Aneja, Michael Luca and Oren Reshef","Is there latent demand to support Black-owned businesses? We explore this question by analyzing a new feature that made it easier to identify Black-owned restaurants on an online platform. We find that labeling restaurants as minority-owned increased customer engagement and firm performance, as measured by online traffic, calls, orders, and in-person visits. These effects were more pronounced in areas characterized by greater support for the Democratic Party and lower implicit bias against racial minorities. Labeled restaurants also see an increase in the fraction of reviews that are written by White customers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230075
American Economic Review,2025,Start-up Costs and Market Power: Lessons from the Renewable Energy Transition,Akshaya Jha and Gordon Leslie,"Firms expect to recover the fixed costs required to start production by earning positive operating profits in subsequent periods. We develop a dynamic competitive benchmark that accounts for start-up costs, showing that static markups overstate the rents attributable to market power in an electricity market where generators frequently stop and start production in response to rooftop solar output. We demonstrate that the large-scale expansion of solar capacity can lead to increases in the collective profitability of fossil fuel plants because competition softens at sunset—plants displaced by solar during the day must incur start-up costs to compete in the evening.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211145
American Economic Review,2025,Five Facts about MPCs: Evidence from a Randomized Experiment,"Johannes Boehm, Etienne Fize and Xavier Jaravel","We present five facts from an experiment on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of transitory transfers: (1) the one-month MPC on a cash-like transfer is 23 percent; (2) it is substantially higher (61 percent) on a transfer administered via a card where remaining funds expire after three weeks, inconsistent with money fungibility; (3) the consumption response is concentrated in the first three weeks; (4) MPCs vary with household characteristics but are high even for the liquid wealthy; (5) unconditional MPC distribution exhibits large variation.

American Economic Review,2025,Universalism: Global Evidence,"Alexander Cappelen, Benjamin Enke and Bertil Tungodden","This paper leverages nationally representative surveys across 60 countries and 64,000 respondents to present novel stylized facts about the relationship-specific nature of altruism. Across individuals, universalist preferences systematically vary with demographics such as age and religiosity and are predictive of many left-wing political views, albeit in culturally highly heterogeneous ways. Across countries, universalism is strongly linked to a broader radius of trust. Looking at origins, universalism varies with the economic, political, and religious organization of societies in ways that are consistent with the idea that the scope of altruism is partly shaped by economic incentives and democracy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230038
American Economic Review,2025,In Harm's Way? Infrastructure Investments and the Persistence of Coastal Cities,Clare Balboni,"Coasts contain a disproportionate share of the world's population, reflecting historical advantages, but environmental change threatens a reversal of coastal fortune in the coming decades as natural disasters intensify and sea levels rise. This paper considers whether large infrastructure investments should continue to favor coastal areas. I estimate a dynamic spatial equilibrium framework using detailed geo-referenced data on road investments in Vietnam from 2000 to 2010 and find evidence that coastal favoritism has significant costs. The results highlight the importance of accounting for the dynamic effects of environmental change in deciding where to allocate infrastructure today.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20191943
American Economic Review,2025,Price Floors and Employer Preferences: Evidence from a Minimum Wage Experiment,John J. Horton,"Firms posting job openings in an online labor market were randomly assigned minimum hourly wages. When facing a minimum wage, fewer firms hired, but those they did hire paid higher wages. Hours-worked fell substantially. Treated firms shifted to hiring more productive workers. Using the platform's imposition of a market-wide minimum wage after the experiment, I find that many of the experimental results also hold in equilibrium, including the substitution towards more productive workers. However, there was also a large reduction in the number of jobs posted for which the minimum wage would likely bind.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20170637
American Economic Review,2025,Heterogeneity in School Value Added and the Private Premium,"Tahir Andrabi, Natalie Bau, Jishnu Das and Asim I. Khwaja","We estimate and validate test score–based measures of school quality (school value added, or SVA) in Pakistan. We document substantial variation in SVA within villages and within the public and private sectors, leading to a wide range of possible estimates of the private premium. We also show that parents value SVA. Heterogeneity in parental demand for quality helps explain both the evolution of the market over time and cross-market variation in school quality. The supply side responds to parental demand for quality in the private sector, but there is no evidence it does so in the public sector.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221422
American Economic Review,2025,Organized Voters: Elections and Public Funding of Nonprofits,Camille Urvoy,"What makes politicians respond to civil society organizations' demands? I use new data on government transfers to French associations and exploit close elections to show that politicians grant more funds to ideologically close organizations when the local incumbent is a political ally and was elected by a small margin. The results are consistent with politicians and organizations exchanging financial support for electoral support. Organizations secure funding because of the votes they can deliver, not because of their campaign contributions; however, the fact that transfers appear to be conditioned on support may undermine their ability to help hold politicians accountable.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230056
American Economic Review,2025,The Global Financial Resource Curse,"Gianluca Benigno, Luca Fornaro and Martin Wolf","We provide a model connecting the global saving glut to productivity growth. The key feature is that the tradable sector is the engine of growth of the economy. Capital flows from developing countries to the United States boost demand for US nontradable goods, inducing a reallocation of US economic activity from the tradable sector to the nontradable one. In turn, lower profits in the tradable sector lead firms to cut back investment in innovation. Since innovation in the United States determines the evolution of the world technological frontier, the result is a drop in global productivity growth.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211792
American Economic Review,2025,Dying or Lying? For-Profit Hospices and End-of-Life Care,"Jonathan Gruber, David H. Howard, Jetson Leder-Luis and Theodore L. Caputi","The Medicare hospice program is intended to provide palliative care to terminal patients, but patients with long stays in hospice are highly profitable, motivating concerns about overuse among the Alzheimer's and Dementia (ADRD) population in the rapidly growing for-profit sector. We provide the first causal estimates of the effect of for-profit hospice on patient spending using the entry of for-profit hospices over 20 years. We find hospice has saved money for Medicare by offsetting other expensive care among ADRD patients. As a result, policies limiting hospice use including revenue caps and antifraud lawsuits are distortionary and deter potentially cost-saving admissions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230328
American Economic Review,2025,Whatever It Takes? The Impact of Conditional Policy Promises,"Valentin Haddad, Alan Moreira and Tyler Muir","At the announcement of a new policy, agents form a view of state-contingent policy actions and impact. We develop a method to estimate this state-contingent perception and implement it for many asset-purchase interventions worldwide. Expectations of larger support in bad states—""policy puts""—explain a large fraction of the announcements' impact. For example, when the Fed introduced purchases of corporate bonds in March 2020, markets expected five times more price support had conditions worsened relative to the median scenario. Perceived promises of additional support in bad states alter asset prices, risk, and the response to future announcements.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230486
American Economic Review,2025,Dynamic Inconsistency in Risky Choice: Evidence from the Lab and Field,"Rawley Heimer, Zwetelina Iliewa, Alex Imas and Martin Weber","We document a robust dynamic inconsistency in risky choice. Using a unique brokerage dataset and a series of experiments, we compare people's initial risk-taking plans to their subsequent decisions. Across settings, people accept risk as part of a loss-exit strategy—planning to continue taking risk after gains and stopping after losses. Actual behavior deviates from initial strategies by cutting gains early and chasing losses. More people accept risk when offered a commitment to their initial strategy. Our results help reconcile seemingly contradictory findings on risk-taking in static versus dynamic contexts. We explore implications for theory and welfare.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210307
