Journal of Labor Economics,2023,The Quality-Adjusted Cyclical Price of Labor,"Mark Bils, Marianna Kudlyak and Paulo Lins","We estimate cyclicality in labor’s user cost allowing for cyclical fluctuations in the quality of worker-firm matches and wages that are smoothed within employment matches. To do so, we exploit a match’s long-run wage to control for its quality. Using 1980–2019 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, we identify three channels by which recessions affect user cost: they lower the new-hire wage and wages going forward in the match, but they also result in higher subsequent separations. We find that labor’s user cost is highly procyclical, increasing by more than 4% for a 1 percentage point decline in unemployment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726701
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Increasing Earnings Inequality: Reconciling Evidence from Survey and Administrative Data,"John Haltiwanger, Henry R. Hyatt and James R. Spletzer","Analyses of survey data highlight observable person characteristics, such as education and occupation, as critical factors for rising earnings inequality, while industry has an offsetting effect. In contrast, analysis of administrative data highlights that rising between-firm earnings dispersion and, in turn, between-industry earnings dispersion dominates the rise in earnings inequality. We construct a novel integrated dataset based on CPS micro data linked with LEHD administrative records. We find that most of the rise in earnings inequality is accounted for by rising between-industry inequality. This finding reflects a substantial contribution of increased sorting and segregation of observable person characteristics between industries.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726632
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,The Slow Diffusion of Earnings Inequality,Isaac Sorkin and Melanie Wallskog,Rising between-firm pay dispersion accounts for the majority of the dramatic increase in earnings inequality in the United States in the last several decades. This paper shows that a distinct cross-cohort pattern drives this rise: newer cohorts of firms enter more dispersed and stay more dispersed throughout their lives. These cohort patterns suggest a link between changes in firm entry associated with the decline in business dynamism and the rise in earnings inequality. Cohort effects also imply a slow diffusion of inequality: inequality rises as younger and more unequal cohorts of firms replace older and more equal cohorts.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726635
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Long Social Distancing,"Jose Maria Barrero, Nicholas Bloom and Steven Davis","Many Americans continued some forms of social distancing after the pandemic. This phenomenon is stronger among older persons, less educated individuals, and those who interact daily with persons at high risk from infectious diseases. Regression models fit to individual-level data suggest that social distancing lowered labor force participation by 2.4 percentage points in 2022, 1.2 points on an earnings-weighted basis. When combined with simple equilibrium models, our results imply that the social distancing drag on participation reduced US output by $205 billion in 2022, shrank the college wage premium by 2.1 percentage points, and modestly steepened the cross-sectional age-wage profile.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726636
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,"Outsourcing, Occupationally Homogeneous Employers, and Wage Inequality in the United States",Elizabeth Handwerker,"This paper develops measures of the occupational homogeneity of employers as indicators of outsourcing. Findings are threefold. First, wages are strongly related to occupational homogeneity, particularly for workers in low-wage occupations. Second, by some measures, workers—particularly those in higher-wage occupations—saw their employing establishments become more occupationally homogeneous during 2004–19. Third, changes in the occupational homogeneity of workplaces contributed to growing wage inequality among workers over the first part of this period. The growing sorting and segregation of workers by occupation into different employers is an important part of wage inequality.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726634
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,"Firm Market Power, Worker Mobility, and Wages in the US Labor Market",Sadhika Bagga,"Worker mobility and wages have declined in the United States amid rising employer market power. I propose a theory of the labor market in which a decrease in employer competition, characterized by fewer firms per worker, drives the decline in worker mobility and wages. A finite and decreasing number of employers exert market power by excluding their offers from the outside options of their employees. This reduces the value of workers’ outside options and, consequently, their wages and transitions across employers. I quantify the model to explain the long-run decline in worker mobility and wages and examine its cross-sectional implications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726819
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Monopsony Power in Higher Education: A Tale of Two Tracks,Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson,"This paper measures the degree of monopsony power in the US higher-education labor market by using school-specific labor demand instruments to directly estimate the residual labor supply curves facing individual universities. The results indicate that schools have significant monopsony power over tenure-track faculty but face perfectly elastic residual labor supply curves for non-tenure-track faculty. There is some evidence for three sources of monopsony power often discussed in the literature—employer concentration, search frictions/job-switching costs, and differentiated jobs. The results also suggest that monopsony over tenure-track faculty may have contributed to the trend toward hiring more non-tenure-track faculty.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726720
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,The Effect of Minimum Wage Policies on the Wage and Occupational Structure of Establishments,Eliza Forsythe,"Using establishment-level panel data from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics program, I estimate the effect of minimum wage increases implemented by 10 states in 2014 and 2015. I show that minimum wage increases lead to wage spillovers within establishments. I find little evidence that minimum wage increases induce establishments to reorganize their occupational mix. Finally, I find that minimum wage increases propagate up the management hierarchy, leading to increased wages for supervisors. Nonetheless, I find that overall wage inequality decreases within establishments after minimum wage increases.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726820
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Unobserved Endowments and Gender Differences in Marriage Matching,"Wenchao Li, Xuyan Lou, Junjian Yi and Junsen Zhang","This study investigates the effects of unobserved earnings-related endowments on marital outcomes, focusing on potential gender differences. Using a less stringent, more plausible assumption that monozygotic twins share more similar endowments relative to dizygotic twins, we develop a novel identification strategy from the twins experiment. Using unique Chinese twins survey data, we find that men with genetic endowments related to higher earnings marry earlier and have younger, taller wives; such women marry later and have older husbands with higher education and income. Results cast doubt on the conventional assumption of independence between unobservables and observable marital attributes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720762
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Searching with Friends,"Stefano Caria, Simon Franklin and Marc Witte","We study how active labor market policies affect the exchange of information and support among job seekers. Leveraging a unique social network survey in Ethiopia, we find that a randomized job search assistance intervention reduces information sharing and support between treated job seekers and their active job search partners. Because of lower job search support, untreated individuals search less and, suggestively, have worse employment outcomes. These results are consistent with a model of networks where unemployed individuals form job search partnerships to exploit the complementarities of job search.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/721655
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Sick Leave Cuts and (Unhealthy) Returns to Work,Olivier Marie and Judit Vall Castello,"We investigate the impact on work absences of a large reduction in paid sick leave benefits in Spain. Our results highlight substantial decreases in frequency (number of spells) mostly offset by increases in duration (length of spells). Overall, the policy did reduce the number of days lost to sick leave. For some, however, return to work was premature, as we document large increases in both the proportion of relapses and the number of working accidents. Displacement toward this unaffected benefit scheme cancels out almost two-fifths of the gains in terms of estimated absence reductions from the sick leave benefit cut.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720629
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,The Labor Market Effects of Immigration Enforcement,"Chloe East, Annie L. Hines, Philip Luck, Hani Mansour and Andrea Velasquez","We examine the labor market effects of Secure Communities (SC), a police-based immigration enforcement policy implemented in 2008–13. Using variation in implementation across local areas and over time, we find that SC decreased the employment of likely undocumented immigrants. These effects are driven not only by deportations but also by adjustments among immigrants who remain in the United States. Importantly, SC also decreased the employment and hourly wages of US-born individuals. We provide support for two mechanisms that could explain this decline in labor demand: an increase in labor costs that decreases job creation and a reduction in local consumption.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/721152
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,When Crime Comes to the Neighborhood: Short-Term Shocks to Student Cognition and Secondary Consequences,Eunsik Chang and María Padilla-Romo,"We provide evidence that short-term shocks to student cognitive performance have long-lasting consequences for human capital development. We use administrative data from Mexico City to show that students’ exposure to violent crime in the week immediately prior to a high-stakes exam lowers females’ test scores by 11% of a standard deviation. As a result, 19% of female students exposed to violent crime are subsequently assigned to less preferred, lower-quality high schools. We find no such effect for males and show that crime-induced concentration problems are an underlying mechanism behind the detrimental effects on females’ test scores.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/721656
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,What’s the Inside Scoop? Challenges in the Supply and Demand for Information on Employers,Jason Sockin and Aaron Sojourner,"Workers struggle to understand prospective employers. Through experienced workers’ volunteered reviews, Glassdoor is a platform seeking to provide information about prospective employers to job seekers. We find that the content most valuable to job seekers (negative information) is the kind most risky to supply, pointing to a catch-22. Higher ratings increase job applications to smaller firms only, creating an incentive for them to discourage negative reviews. Concerns about employer retaliation discourage negative reviews and motivate employees who do disclose to conceal aspects of their identity, degrading the information’s value. Reputation institutions provide valuable but partial solutions to workers’ information problems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/721701
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Access to Head Start and Maternal Labor Supply: Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Evidence,Jocelyn Wikle and Riley Wilson,"We explore how access to Head Start affects maternal labor supply. By relaxing childcare constraints, public preschools like Head Start might lead mothers to reallocate time among employment, childcare, and other activities. Using the 1990s enrollment and funding expansions and the 2002 Head Start Impact Study randomized controlled trial, we show that Head Start increases short-run employment and wage earnings of single mothers without reducing quality parent-child interactions. Even before including long-run benefits to children, the short-run benefit to single mothers and the government is $0.93 per dollar. Head Start is a family-level treatment with impacts beyond children.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720980
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Effects of Child Tax Benefits on Poverty and Labor Supply: Evidence from the Canada Child Benefit and Universal Child Care Benefit,"Michael Baker, Derek Messacar and Mark Stabile","We investigate how reforms of Canada’s child allowances affected household poverty and maternal employment—the 2015 increase and expansion of the Universal Child Care Benefit and the 2016 introduction of a new Canada Child Benefit (CCB). We document that both reforms reduced child poverty, although the CCB had greater effect. By 2018, we estimate that the CCB reduced poverty by 11% in families headed by a single mother and by nearly 17% in two-parent families. We find no evidence, on either the extensive or the intensive margin, of a negative labor supply response to either of the program reforms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/721379
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,The Consequences of Letter Grades for Labor Market Outcomes and Student Behavior,Brandon Joel Tan,"I study the consequences of letter grades serving as coarse measures of academic achievement using university administrative data that record both the letter grade and the precise mark (0–100) received for each course that a given student takes. I exploit a regression discontinuity design with marks as the running variable. I find that receiving a better grade in a single class results in USD 32 greater monthly earnings after graduation, a 1.4% increase. I also find that marginal students who receive a worse grade take significantly easier courses and earn lower grades in future semesters.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719994
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Interactions with Powerful Female Colleagues Promote Diversity in Hiring,"Marco Battaglini, Jorgen Harris and Eleonora Patacchini","We study the effect of hearing cases alongside female judicial colleagues on the probability that a federal judge hires a female law clerk. Federal judges are assigned to judicial panels at random and have few limitations on their choices of clerks. Using a unique dataset of federal case records merged with judicial hiring information, we find a significant effect of the fraction of copanelists who are female on a male judge’s likelihood of hiring a female clerk. This finding suggests that increases in the diversity of the upper rungs of a profession can create opportunities at the entry level.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720392
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,The Health and Welfare Effects of Increases in Workers’ Compensation Benefits,Lu Jinks,"This paper estimates the causal impacts of workers’ compensation income benefits on workers’ health and welfare outcomes. Using claims data from 2004 to 2016, I explore the variation in benefits due to a reform of New York workers’ compensation that increased the maximum weekly benefits. I find that a $77 increase in the weekly benefits led to an additional 3.4 days off work. Medical utilization did not increase. Each extra day off work decreased the reinjury likelihood by 2.9%. The current benefit level in New York is close to optimal in balancing payer cost and worker health outcomes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720456
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,"The Effect of School and Neighborhood Peers on Achievement, Misbehavior, and Adult Crime",Stephen B. Billings and Mark Hoekstra,"This paper assesses the importance of school and neighborhood peers in shaping educational achievement, adolescent misbehavior, and adult crime. Using cohort variation within Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, we focus on the impact of peers whose parents have been arrested, which is strongly and independently predictive of worse outcomes. Results indicate that a 5 percentage point increase in school peers linked to parental arrest reduces educational achievement by 0.016 standard deviations and increases adult arrest rates by 5%. Additional evidence indicates that peer effects are primarily driven by interactions in schools rather than in neighborhoods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720323
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Testing Means-Tested Aid,Richard Murphy and Gill Wyness,"We estimate the effect of an unexpected institutional financial aid (IFA) award on student outcomes using administrative data collected from nine universities, exploiting variation in IFA schedules within and across university-entry cohorts. Each £1,000 of IFA during the first year of college increases the chances of completing that year by 1.4 percentage points, improves test scores by 0.059 standard deviations, and increases the chances of graduating with a good degree by 3.4 percentage points. We find that high-ability and low-income students benefit the most and calculate outcome-maximizing and cost-minimizing IFA schedules for each university.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719995
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,The Direct and Spillover Effects of a Nationwide Socioemotional Learning Program for Disruptive Students,Clément de Chaisemartin and Nicolás Navarrete H.,"Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs that target disruptive students aim to improve their classroom behavior. Small-scale programs in high-income countries have demonstrated positive effects. Using a randomized experiment, we show that a nationwide SEL program in Chile has no effect. Very disruptive students seem to reduce the program’s effectiveness. With attention deficit hyperactivity disorder being more prevalent in middle- than high-income countries, very disruptive students may be more present there, which could diminish the effectiveness of SEL programs. Moreover, implementation fidelity seems lower in this program than in the small-scale ones considered earlier, which could also explain the program’s null effect.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720455
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Understanding the Effect of Parental Education and Financial Resources on the Intergenerational Transmission of Income,Aiday Sikhova,"There are two essential mechanisms in the canonical model of the transmission of income across generations—parents’ financial resources and parental education. I provide novel empirical evidence to disentangle the significance of these two mechanisms in explaining the intergenerational transmission of income. Utilizing two reforms and administrative data from Sweden, I find that parents’ financial resources amount to about 25% of the effect of parental education on children’s income. Additionally, I show that parents’ financial resources matter less for sons. Overall, my findings suggest a comparatively modest impact of parental financial resources on children’s income.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720390
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Wage Inequality in Germany after the Minimum Wage Introduction,Mario Bossler and Thorsten Schank,"Monthly wage inequality in Germany continued to increase in the early 2000s, which is mainly explained by a rising part-time employment share. After 2010, inequality returned to the level of 2000. About half of the recent decrease is due to the introduction of the national minimum wage in 2015. While employment effects of the minimum wage are negligible, we find strong wage increases among the existing workforce. The minimum wage lowered wage inequality within eastern and western Germany but also led to a convergence of the east-west wage differential. The increased labor incomes were not offset by decreasing social benefits.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720391
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,How Much Should We Trust Estimates of Firm Effects and Worker Sorting?,"Stéphane Bonhomme, Kerstin Holzheu, Thibaut Lamadon, Elena Manresa, Magne Mogstad and Bradley Setzler",Many studies use matched employer-employee data to estimate a statistical model of earnings determination with worker and firm fixed effects. Estimates based on this model have produced influential yet controversial conclusions. The objective of this paper is to assess the sensitivity of these conclusions to the biases that arise because of limited mobility of workers across firms. We use employer-employee data from the United States and several European countries while taking advantage of both fixed effects and random effects methods for bias correction. We find that limited mobility bias is severe and that bias correction is important.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720009
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Network Connections and Board Seats: Are Female Networks Less Valuable?,Emma  von Essen and Nina Smith,"We investigate how sizes of professional networks affect the probability of appointment to a supervisory board and whether the effect is gendered. Using an employer-employee data set of the Danish labor market, 1995–2011, we find larger networks to associate with a higher probability of becoming a first-time director. The effect is larger for men. One explanation is that men, compared with women, have more connections to larger and listed firms and to other males—attributes that increase the appointment probability. Women who have connections to incumbent directors before being appointed director have more labor market experience than other directors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719965
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Labor Market Discrimination against Family Responsibilities: A Correspondence Study with Policy Change in China,"Haoran He, Sherry Xin Li and Yuling Han","China shifted its controversial one-child policy (1979–2015) to a two-child policy in 2016. We take advantage of this unexpected policy change and the heterogeneities in the prechange environment to investigate labor market discrimination against expected family responsibilities. In a two-wave correspondence study before and after the policy change, we sent 8,848 fictitious resumes with ages 22–29 in response to online job advertisements. Their gender and only-child/siblinged status were systematically varied. We find that women—but not men—are subject to labor market discrimination for expected family responsibilities. This discrimination worsens with the increase in women’s reproductive age.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719966
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Mothers Working during Preschool Years and Child Skills: Does Income Compensate?,"Cheti Nicoletti, Kjell G Salvanes and Emma Tominey","Increasing mother’s labor supply during a child’s preschool years may reduce time investments, yielding a negative direct effect on midchildhood and teenage outcomes. But as mother’s work hours increase, income will rise. Can income compensate for the negative effect of hours? Our mediation analysis exploits exogenous variation in both mother’s hours and family income. Results suggest a negative, insignificant direct effect from increasing mother’s hours on child test scores. However, the positive mediating effect of income creates a positive total effect on test scores (26% of a standard deviation) for a 10-hour increase in mother’s weekly hours in preschool years.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719688
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,When the Stadium Goes Silent: How Crowds Affect the Performance of Discriminated Groups,"Mauro Caselli, Paolo Falco and Gianpiero Mattera","Using a natural experiment induced by COVID-19, we test how the sudden absence of fans at football games impacts player performance in Italy. We find that African players, who are most commonly targeted by racial harassment, play better when fans are no longer at the stadium. A similar, albeit weaker, effect is detected among black players. Using official records of racist behavior by fans, we show that performance improves the most on teams that were subject to abuse before the lockdown. Our evidence suggests that racist pressure can harm discriminated groups and lower the overall quality of the game.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719967
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Workplace Incentives and Organizational Learning,Francesco Amodio and Miguel Martinez-Carrasco,"This paper studies learning among coworkers when incentives change. We use a simple principal-agent model to show that when workers are not fully informed on the global shape of the production function, (1) their effort choice changes over time as information is disclosed and processed and (2) changing incentives can trigger this learning process. We test this prediction using personnel data from an egg production plant in Peru. Exploiting a sudden change in the contract parameters, we find that workers learn from each other over the shape of the production function. This adjustment process is costly for the firm.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719686
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Optimal Allocation of Seats in the Presence of Peer Effects: Evidence from a Job Training Program,"Matthew D. Baird, John Engberg and Isaac Opper","We model optimal treatment assignment in programs with a limited number of seats and study how the presence of peer effects impacts the optimal allocation rule. We then use data from a randomized control trial to show evidence that there are large peer effects in the context of job training for disadvantaged adults in the United States. Finally, we combine the model and the empirics to show that the program would have had a much greater impact if the assignment choices had accounted for the peer effects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719968
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Foreign Students in College and the Supply of STEM Graduates,"Massimo Anelli, Kevin Shih and Kevin Williams","Do foreign students affect the likelihood that domestic students obtain a STEM degree and occupation? Using administrative student records from a US university, we exploit idiosyncratic variation in the share of foreign classmates in introductory math classes and find that foreign classmates displace domestic students from STEM majors and occupations. However, displaced students gravitate toward high-earning social science majors, so their expected earnings are not penalized. We explore several mechanisms. Results indicate that displacement is concentrated in classes where foreign classmates possess weak English language ability, suggesting that diminished in-class communication and social interactions might play an important role.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719964
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,School Finance Equalization Increases Intergenerational Mobility,Barbara Biasi,"This paper estimates the causal effect of equalizing revenues across school districts on students’ intergenerational mobility. I exploit cohort differences in exposure to equalization generated by state-level reforms. To address the endogeneity of postreform revenues due to household sorting after a reform, I use a simulated-instruments approach that uses newly collected data on states’ funding formulas to simulate revenues without sorting. I find that equalization has a large effect on the mobility of low-income students. Reductions in input gaps between low-income and high-income districts are likely channels behind this effect.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718980
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Understanding the Effects of Workfare Policies on Child Human Capital,Jorge Rodriguez,"Workfare can impact child development by inducing parents to spend less time at home. I study the mechanisms by which workfare policies affect children using the New Hope workfare experiment. The program randomly assigned individuals to a policy bundle including income and childcare subsidies conditional on full-time work. For families with young children, the program had positive effects on child academic performance and classroom behavior. Counterfactual experiments from a dynamic discrete choice model indicate that most of the effect of New Hope on young children is explained by parents enrolling their children in center-based childcare.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718564
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,A Different Land of Opportunity: The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility in the Early Twentieth-Century United States,Hui Ren Tan,"Has the geography of intergenerational mobility in the United States changed over time? Constructing a large historical linked sample, I show that upward mobility in the early twentieth century was greater for those who grew up in the coastal and industrial regions, in contrast to more recent times, where mobility is higher among persons who were raised in the middle of the country. The historical patterns are not driven by imperfections in record linkage or measurement error in economic status.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718595
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,"The Minimum Wage, Self-Employment, and the Online Gig Economy",Benjamin Glasner,"This paper estimates the effect of minimum wage increases on work that is not covered by minimum wage laws. I find that minimum wage increases in the early 2000s resulted in small reductions in engagement in traditional self-employment. Following the development of the online gig economy in the 2010s, a 10% increase in the minimum wage increased the number of nonemployer establishments classified as transportation and warehousing services by approximately 2.7%. The counties most likely to exhibit a positive relationship between the minimum wage and participation in uncovered work are those with low labor market concentration and active Uber marketplaces.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719690
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Education Transmission and Network Formation,"Vincent Boucher, Carlo L. Del Bello, Fabrizio Panebianco, Thierry Verdier and Yves Zenou","We propose a model of intergenerational transmission of education wherein children belong to either highly educated or low-educated families. Children choose the intensity of their social activities, while parents decide how much educational effort to exert. Using Add Health data, we find that, on average, children’s homophily acts as a complement to the educational effort of highly educated parents but as a substitute for the educational effort of low-educated parents. We also find that policies that subsidize kids’ socialization efforts can backfire for low-educated students because they tend to increase their interactions with other low-educated students.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718981
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Explaining Recent Trends in US School Segregation,Gregorio Caetano and Vikram Maheshri,"From 2002 to 2018, the fraction of minority-segregated public schools in the United States roughly doubled, but the fraction of White-segregated schools decreased at an even faster rate. Endogenous segregation fueled by parents choosing schools on the basis of their racial compositions can in principle dwarf all other determinants of segregation over time because of social multiplier effects. However, we find that demographic change from Hispanic immigration has been the biggest driver of these trends. These findings are particularly pronounced in urban areas, which experienced the largest changes in segregation and are where policy makers are most concerned about the pernicious effects of segregation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718975
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Borrowing Constraints and the Dynamics of Return and Repeat Migration,Joseph-Simon Görlach,"As wages in migrant-sending countries catch up with those in destinations, migrants adjust on several margins, including their duration of stay, the number of migrations they undertake, and the amount saved while abroad. This paper combines Mexican and US data to estimate a dynamic model of consumption, emigration, and remigration, accounting for financial constraints. An increase in Mexican household earnings shortens migration duration but raises the number of trips per migrant. For lower-income migrants, a rise in Mexican wages leads to a more than proportional effect on consumption expenditure in Mexico, arising from repatriated savings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719687
Journal of Labor Economics,2023,Putting the Husband Through: The Role of Credit Constraints in the Timing of Marriage and Spousal Education,Murat Iyigun and Jeanne Lafortune,"In the United States, age at first marriage was lowest and the education gap between husbands and wives was highest during the 1950s. The conventional explanation for such a negative correlation is that early marriage leads to earlier and higher fertility, which in turn prevents women from acquiring education. Here, we propose that early marriages enabled couples to overcome credit constraints in education. A model that includes this motive and mechanism can replicate not only the marriage and education patterns observed in the middle of the century in the United States but also the overall trends over the twentieth century.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719689
