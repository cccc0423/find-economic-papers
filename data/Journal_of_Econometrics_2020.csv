Journal of Econometrics,2020,The term structure of equity and variance risk premia,"Yacine Ait-Sahalia, Mustafa Karaman and Loriano Mancini","We study the term structure of variance swaps, equity and variance risk premia. A model-free analysis reveals a significant price jump component in variance swaps. A model-based analysis shows that investors’ willingness to ensure against volatility risk increases after a market drop. This effect is stronger for short maturities, but more persistent for long maturities. During the financial crisis investors demanded large risk premia to hold equities, but the risk premia largely depended on and strongly decreased with the holding horizon. The term structure of equity and variance risk premia responds differently to various economic indicators.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762030097X
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Point optimal testing with roots that are functionally local to unity,Anna Bykhovskaya and Peter Phillips,"Limit theory for regressions involving local to unit roots (LURs) is now used extensively in time series econometric work, establishing power properties for unit root and cointegration tests, assisting the construction of uniform confidence intervals for autoregressive coefficients, and enabling the development of methods robust to departures from unit roots. The present paper shows how to generalize LUR asymptotics to cases where the localized departure from unity is a time varying function rather than a constant. Such a functional local unit root (FLUR) model has much greater generality and encompasses many cases of additional interest that appear in practical work, including structural break formulations that admit subperiods of unit root, local stationary and local explosive behavior within a given sample. Point optimal FLUR tests are constructed in the paper to accommodate such cases and demonstrate how the power envelope changes in situations of practical interest. Against FLUR alternatives, conventional constant point optimal tests can be asymptotically infinitely deficient in power, with poor finite sample power performance particularly when the departure from unity occurs early in the sample period. New analytic explanation for this phenomenon is provided. Simulation results are reported and some implications for empirical practice are examined.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300981
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Score tests in GMM: Why use implied probabilities?,Saraswata Chaudhuri and Eric Renault,"While simple to implement and thus attractive in practice, the GMM score test of Newey and West (1987) often displays upward size distortion under common scenarios involving skewed moment vectors or models with weak identification. Inference based on the Generalized Empirical Likelihood (GEL) is seen as a general solution to this problem. Kleibergen (2005) and, more generally, Guggenberger and Smith (2005) devised an elegant theory for the GEL score tests. However, strictly speaking, the GEL score tests do not nest the Newey–West score test. Our paper provides a unified framework for score tests in GMM that nests all of the above as special cases and helps us to understand the precise mechanism by which the standard first order asymptotic theory on size and power well approximates the finite sample behavior of some score tests (namely, a subset of the GEL score tests) but not others. Special attention is paid to models with weak identification. We also argue that the apparent computational burden of GEL can be overcome in practice by recognizing the fundamental common role played by the GEL implied probabilities under all special cases of our framework. In particular, we show that all the GEL implied probabilities are asymptotically equivalent at a higher order – both under the null and under appropriate sequences of alternatives – and thus are exchangeable across computationally burdensome (e.g. Empirical Likelihood) and easy (e.g. Euclidean Empirical Likelihood) GEL score tests without affecting the first order asymptotics. Extensive simulation evidence is provided to corroborate our theoretical results. The simulation results also support a simple and yet important insight on the power of the tests: the use of implied probabilities to efficiently estimate the components of the score statistic, namely, the Jacobian and the asymptotic variance of the moment vector, can significantly improve the power of the score test in finite samples.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300993
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Asymptotic theory for time series with changing mean and variance,"Violetta Dalla, Liudas Giraitis and Peter M. Robinson","The paper develops point estimation and asymptotic theory with respect to a semiparametric model for time series with moving mean and unconditional heteroscedasticity. These two features are modelled nonparametrically, whereas autocorrelations are described by a short memory stationary parametric time series model. We first study the usual least squares estimate of the coefficient of the first-order autoregressive model based on constant but unknown mean and variance. Allowing for both the latter to vary over time in a general way we establish its probability limit and a central limit theorem for a suitably normed and centred statistic, giving explicit bias and variance formulae. As expected mean variation is the main source of inconsistency and heteroscedasticity the main source of inefficiency, though we discuss circumstances in which the estimate is consistent for, and asymptotically normal about, the autoregressive coefficient, albeit inefficient. We then consider standard implicitly-defined Whittle estimates of a more general class of short memory parametric time series model, under otherwise more restrictive conditions. When the mean is correctly assumed to be constant, estimates that ignore the heteroscedasticity are again found to be asymptotically normal but inefficient. Allowing a slowly time-varying mean we resort to trimming out of low frequencies to achieve the same outcome. Returning to finite order autoregression, nonparametric estimates of the varying mean and variance are given asymptotic justification, and forecasting formulae developed. Finite sample properties are studied by a small Monte Carlo simulation, and an empirical example is also included.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301007
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Testing for a trend with persistent errors,Graham Elliott,"We develop new tests for the coefficient on a time trend in a regression of a variable on a constant and time trend where there is potentially strong serial correlation. This serial correlation can also include a unit root. We obtain tests under two different assumptions on the initial value for the stochastic component of the variable being examined, either this being zero asymptotically and also allowing the initial condition to be drawn from its unconditional distribution. We find that statistics perform better under the second of these assumptions, which is the more natural assumption to make.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301019
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Heterogeneous panel data models with cross-sectional dependence,"Jiti Gao, Kai Xia and Huanjun Zhu","This paper considers a semiparametric panel data model with heterogeneous coefficients and individual-specific trending functions, where the random errors are assumed to be serially correlated and cross-sectionally dependent. We propose mean group estimators for the coefficients and trending functions involved in the model. It can be shown that the proposed estimators can achieve an asymptotic consistency with rates of root−NT and root−NTh, respectively as (N,T)→(∞,∞), where N is allowed to increase faster than T. Furthermore, a statistic for testing homogeneous coefficients is constructed based on the difference between the mean group estimator and a pooled estimator. Its asymptotic distributions are established under both the null and a sequence of local alternatives, even if the difference between these estimators vanishes considerably fast (can achieve root-NT2 rate at most under the null) and no consistent estimator for the covariance matrix is required. The finite sample performance of the proposed estimators together with the size and local power properties of the test are demonstrated by simulated data examples, and an empirical application with the OECD health care expenditure dataset is also provided.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301020
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Level shift estimation in the presence of non-stationary volatility with an application to the unit root testing problem,"David Harris, Hsein Kew and Robert Taylor","This paper focuses on the estimation of the location of level breaks in time series whose shocks display non-stationary volatility (permanent changes in unconditional volatility). We propose a new feasible weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, based on an adaptive estimate of the volatility path of the shocks. We show that this estimator belongs to a generic class of weighted residual sum of squares which also contains the ordinary least squares (OLS) and WLS estimators, the latter based on the true volatility process. For fixed magnitude breaks we show that the consistency rate of the generic estimator is unaffected by non-stationary volatility. We also provide local limiting distribution theory for cases where the break magnitude is either local-to-zero at some polynomial rate in the sample size or is exactly zero. The former includes the Pitman drift rate which is shown via Monte Carlo experiments to predict well the key features of the finite sample behaviour of both the OLS and our feasible WLS estimators. The simulations highlight the importance of the break location, break magnitude, and the form of non-stationary volatility for the finite sample performance of these estimators, and show that our proposed feasible WLS estimator can deliver significant improvements over the OLS estimator under heteroskedasticity. We discuss how these results can be applied, by using level break fraction estimators on the first differences of the data, when testing for a unit root in the presence of trend breaks and/or non-stationary volatility. Methods to select between the break and no break cases, using standard information criteria and feasible weighted information criteria based on our adaptive volatility estimator, are also discussed. Simulation evidence suggests that unit root tests based on these weighted quantities can display significantly improved finite sample behaviour under heteroskedasticity relative to their unweighted counterparts. An empirical illustration to U.S. and U.K. real GDP is also considered.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301032
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Nonparametric estimation of infinite order regression and its application to the risk-return tradeoff,Seok Young Hong and Oliver Linton,"This paper studies nonparametric estimation of the infinite order regression E(Ytk|Ft−1), k∈Z with stationary and weakly dependent data. We propose a Nadaraya–Watson type estimator that operates with an infinite number of conditioning variables. We propose a bandwidth sequence that shrinks the effects of long lags, so the influence of all conditioning information is modelled in a natural and flexible way, and the issues of omitted information bias and specification error are effectively handled. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimator under a wide range of static and dynamic regressions frameworks, thereby allowing various kinds of conditioning variables to be used. We establish pointwise/uniform consistency and CLTs. We show that the convergence rates are at best logarithmic, and depend on the smoothness of the regression, the distribution of the marginal regressors and their dependence structure in a non-trivial way via the Lambert W function. We apply our methodology to examine the intertemporal risk-return relation for the aggregate stock market, and some new empirical evidence is reported. For the S&P 500 daily data from 1950 to 2017 using our estimator we report an overall positive risk-return relation. We also find evidence of strong time variation and counter-cyclical behaviour in risk aversion. These conclusions are possibly attributable to the allowance of further flexibility and the inclusion of otherwise neglected information in our method.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301044
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Hypothesis testing based on a vector of statistics,"Maxwell King, Xibin Zhang and Muhammad Akram","This paper presents a new approach to hypothesis testing based on a vector of statistics. It involves simulating the statistics under the null hypothesis and then estimating the joint density of the statistics. This allows the p-value of the smallest acceptance region test to be estimated. We prove this p-value is a consistent estimate under some regularity conditions. The small-sample properties of the proposed procedure are investigated in the context of testing for autocorrelation, testing for normality, and testing for model misspecification through the information matrix.

We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed LASSO estimator and validate our theoretical findings using simulation studies. The application of this proposed LASSO approach to forecasting stock returns suggests that a cointegrating relationship among the persistent predictors leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of stock returns over various competing forecasting methods with respect to mean squared error.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301068

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Adjusted QMLE for the spatial autoregressive parameter,Federico Martellosio and Grant Hillier,"One simple, and often very effective, way to attenuate the impact of nuisance parameters on maximum likelihood estimation of a parameter of interest is to recenter the profile score for that parameter. We apply this general principle to the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) of the autoregressive parameter λ in a spatial autoregression. The resulting estimator for λ has better finite sample properties compared to the QMLE for λ, especially in the presence of a large number of covariates. It can also solve the incidental parameter problem that arises, for example, in social interaction models with network fixed effects. However, spatial autoregressions present specific challenges for this type of adjustment, because recentering the profile score may cause the adjusted estimate to be outside the usual parameter space for λ. Conditions for this to happen are given, and implications are discussed. For inference, we propose confidence intervals based on a Lugannani–Rice approximation to the distribution of the adjusted QMLE of λ. Based on our simulations, the coverage properties of these intervals are excellent even in models with a large number of covariates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301081

New cross-section and panel extremum estimators of the degree of dominance in networks are proposed, and their asymptotic properties investigated. The small sample properties of the proposed estimators are examined by Monte Carlo experiments, and their use is illustrated by an empirical application to US input–output tables.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301093

The model primitives are shown to be nonparametrically identified from first-price auction bids under a testable mild rank condition. Identification holds for all possible signal values. This allows to consider a wide range of counterfactuals where this is important, as expected revenue in second-price auction.

We develop a strong approximation theory for sample averages of mixingales with dimensions growing with the sample size. We use this result to justify the asymptotic validity of a uniform confidence band for series estimators and show that it can also be used to conduct nonparametric specification test for conditional moment restrictions. New results on the validity of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimators with increasing dimension are established for making feasible inference.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Robust inference for spurious regressions and cointegrations involving processes moderately deviated from a unit root,Yingqian Lin and Yundong Tu,"This paper studies spurious regressions involving processes moderately deviated from a unit root (PMDURs), and establishes the limiting distributions for the least squares estimator, the associated t-statistic, the coefficient of determination R2 and the Durbin–Watson statistic. We find that these limiting distributions critically depend on nuisance parameters that characterize the local deviations from unity, making inference for spurious regressions practically impossible using the conventional t-statistic. As a cure, we propose robust inference based on the balanced regression model, where the lagged regressor and the lagged dependent variable are augmented to the original regression. The induced t-statistic via such an augmentation is shown to be asymptotically standard normal and is therefore free of nuisance parameters, which turns out to be a robust and simple-to-implement tool for spurious regressions inference. Moreover, the limiting properties of other statistics are investigated. The balanced regression based inference is further shown to continue to work for cointegration models with PMDURs, which is therefore robust to whether the PMDURs are spuriously related or cointegrated. Finally, the finite sample properties of the robust method are demonstrated through both Monte Carlo and real data examples.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301585

The factor loading matrix is assumed to have a structural break at an unknown time. We establish the conditions under which the least squares (LS) estimator is consistent for the break date. Our consistency result holds for both large and small breaks. We also find the LS estimator’s asymptotic distribution. Simulation results confirm that the break date can be accurately estimated by the LS even if the magnitudes of breaks are small. In two empirical applications, we implement the method to estimate break points in the U.S. stock market and U.S. macroeconomy, respectively.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301172
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Doubly robust difference-in-differences estimators,"Sant’Anna, Pedro H.C. and Jun Zhao","This article proposes doubly robust estimators for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) in difference-in-differences (DID) research designs. In contrast to alternative DID estimators, the proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score or outcome regression working models are correctly specified. We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. Open-source software for implementing the proposed policy evaluation tools is available.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301901

We study the asymptotic properties of the least squares estimators of the regression parameters in the shrinking-threshold-effect framework. We find that under some regularity conditions, the threshold parameter estimator possesses super-consistency in the sense that its estimation error has an asymptotically negligible effect on the asymptotic properties of the slope coefficients. The inference on the threshold parameter can be conducted based on a likelihood ratio test statistic as in the cross-sectional or time series setup. We also propose a test for the presence of the threshold effect. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that our estimators and test statistics perform well in finite samples.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Ill-posed estimation in high-dimensional models with instrumental variables,"Christoph Breunig, Enno Mammen and Anna Simoni","This paper is concerned with inference about low-dimensional components of a high-dimensional parameter vector β0 which is identified through instrumental variables. We allow for eigenvalues of the expected outer product of included and excluded covariates, denoted by M, to shrink to zero as the sample size increases. We propose a novel estimator based on desparsification of an instrumental variable Lasso estimator, which is a regularized version of 2SLS with an additional correction term. This estimator converges to β0 at a rate depending on the mapping properties of M. Linear combinations of our estimator of β0 are shown to be asymptotically normally distributed. Based on consistent covariance estimation, our method allows for constructing confidence intervals and statistical tests for single or low-dimensional components of β0. In Monte-Carlo simulations we analyze the finite sample behavior of our estimator.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Impossible inference in econometrics: Theory and applications,Marinho Bertanha and Marcelo Moreira,"This paper studies models in which hypothesis tests have trivial power, that is, power smaller than size. This testing impossibility, or impossibility type A, arises when any alternative is not distinguishable from the null. We also study settings in which it is impossible to have almost surely bounded confidence sets for a parameter of interest. This second type of impossibility (type B) occurs under a condition weaker than the condition for type A impossibility: the parameter of interest must be nearly unidentified. Our theoretical framework connects many existing publications on impossible inference that rely on different notions of topologies to show models are not distinguishable or nearly unidentified. We also derive both types of impossibility using the weak topology induced by convergence in distribution. Impossibility in the weak topology is often easier to prove, it is applicable for many widely-used tests, and it is useful for robust hypothesis testing. We conclude by demonstrating impossible inference in multiple economic applications of models with discontinuity and time-series models.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301366
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Testing identification strength,Bertille Antoine and Eric Renault,"We consider models defined by a set of moment restrictions that may be subject to weak identification. We propose a testing procedure to assess whether instruments are “too weak” for standard (Gaussian) asymptotic theory to be reliable. Since the validity of standard asymptotics for GMM rests upon a Taylor expansion of the first order conditions, we distinguish two cases: (i) models that are either linear or separable in the parameters of interest; (ii) general models that are neither linear nor separable. Our testing procedure is similar in both cases, but our null hypothesis of weak identification for a nonlinear model is broader than the popular one. Our test is straightforward to apply and allows to test the null hypothesis of weak identification of specific subvectors without assuming identification of the components not under test. In the linear case, it can be seen as a generalization of the popular first-stage F-test but allows us to fix its shortcomings in case of heteroskedasticity. In simulations, our test is well behaved when compared to contenders, both in terms of size and power. In particular, the focus on subvectors allows us to have power to reject the null of weak identification on some components of interest. This observation may explain why, when applied to the estimation of the Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution, our test is the only one to find matching results for every country under the two symmetric popular specifications: the intercept parameter is always found strongly identified, whereas the slope parameter is always found weakly identified.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301378
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Testing the impossible: Identifying exclusion restrictions,Jan Kiviet,"Method of moments estimation usually implies exploiting presumed uncorrelatedness of model disturbances and identifying instrumental variables. Here, utilizing non-orthogonality conditions is examined for linear multiple cross-section simultaneous regression models. Employing flexible bounds on the correlations between disturbances and regressors one avoids: (i) adoption of often incredible and unverifiable strictly zero correlation assumptions, and (ii) imprecise inference due to possibly weak or invalid external instruments. The suggested alternative form of inference is within constraints endogeneity robust; its asymptotic validity is proved and its accuracy in finite samples demonstrated by simulation. Next to offering an attractive alternative as such, it permits a sensitivity analysis of inference based on orthogonality conditions. Moreover, it yields statistical inference on the validity of exclusion restrictions regarding candidate external instruments, whereas these unavoidable restrictions were always supposed to be non-testable. The practical relevance is illustrated in a few applications borrowed from the textbook literature.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762030138X

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Inference in second-order identified models,"Prosper Dovonon, Alastair R. Hall and Frank Kleibergen","We explore the local power properties of different test statistics for conducting inference in moment condition models that only identify the parameters locally to second order. We consider the conventional Wald and LM statistics, and also the Generalized Anderson–Rubin (GAR) statistic (Anderson and Rubin, 1949; Dufour, 1997; Staiger and Stock, 1997; Stock and Wright, 2000), KLM statistic (Kleibergen, 2002; Kleibergen, 2005) and the GMM extension of Moreira (2003) (GMM-M) conditional likelihood ratio statistic. The GAR, KLM and GMM-M statistics are so-called “identification robust” since their (conditional) limiting distribution is the same under first-order, weak and therefore also second order identification. For inference about the model specification, we consider the identification-robust J statistic (Kleibergen, 2005), and the GAR statistic. Interestingly, we find that the limiting distribution of the Wald statistic under local alternatives not only depends on the distance to the null hypothesis but also on the convergence rate of the Jacobian. We specifically analyse two empirically relevant models with second order identification. In the panel autoregressive model of order one, our analysis indicates that the Wald test of a unit root value of the autoregressive parameter has better power compared to the corresponding GAR test which, in turn, dominates the KLM, GMM-M and LM tests. For the conditionally heteroskedastic factor model, we compare Kleibergen (2005) J and the GAR statistics to Hansen (1982) overidentifying restrictions test (previously analysed in this context by Dovonon and Renault, 2013) and find the power ranking depends on the sample size.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,A geometric approach to inference in set-identified entry games,Christian Bontemps and Rohit Kumar,"In this paper, we consider inference procedures for entry games with complete information. Due to the presence of multiple equilibria, we know that such a model may be set-identified without imposing further restrictions. We complete the model with the unknown selection mechanism and characterize geometrically the set of predicted choice probabilities, in our case, a convex polytope with many facets. Testing whether a parameter belongs to the identified set is equivalent to testing whether the true choice probability vector belongs to this convex set. Using tools from the convex analysis, we calculate the support function and the extreme points. The calculation yields a finite number of inequalities, when the explanatory variables are discrete, and we characterized them once for all. We also propose a procedure that selects the moment inequalities without having to evaluate all of them. This procedure is computationally feasible for any number of players and is based on the geometry of the set. Furthermore, we exploit the specific structure of the test statistic used to test whether a point belongs to a convex set to propose the calculation of critical values that are computed once and independent of the value of the parameter tested, which drastically improves the calculation time. Simulations in a separate section suggest that our procedure performs well compared with existing methods.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762030141X
Journal of Econometrics,2020,"Exogeneity tests, incomplete models, weak identification and non-Gaussian distributions: Invariance and finite-sample distributional theory",Firmin Doko Tchatoka and Jean-Marie Dufour,"We study the distribution of Durbin–Wu–Hausman (DWH) and Revankar–Hartley (RH) tests for exogeneity from a finite-sample viewpoint, under the null and alternative hypotheses. We consider linear structural models with possibly non-Gaussian errors, where structural parameters may not be identified and where reduced forms can be incompletely specified (or nonparametric). On level control, we characterize the null distributions of all the test statistics. Through conditioning and invariance arguments, we show that these distributions do not involve nuisance parameters. In particular, this applies to several test statistics for which no finite-sample distributional theory is yet available, such as the standard statistic proposed by Hausman (1978). The distributions of the test statistics may be non-standard – so corrections to usual asymptotic critical values are needed – but the characterizations are sufficiently explicit to yield finite-sample (Monte-Carlo) tests of the exogeneity hypothesis. The procedures so obtained are robust to weak identification, missing instruments or misspecified reduced forms, and can easily be adapted to allow for parametric non-Gaussian error distributions. We give a general invariance result (block triangular invariance) for exogeneity test statistics. This property yields a convenient exogeneity canonical form and a parsimonious reduction of the parameters on which power depends. In the extreme case where no structural parameter is identified, the distributions under the alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis are identical, so the power function is flat, for all the exogeneity statistics. However, as soon as identification does not fail completely, this phenomenon typically disappears. We present simulation experiments which confirm the finite-sample theory. The theoretical results are illustrated with an empirical example : the relation between trade and economic growth.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301421
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Monte Carlo two-stage indirect inference (2SIF) for autoregressive panels,Lynda Khalaf and Charles J. Saunders,"Persistence and mean-nonstationarity often undermine reliability of asymptotically justified inference in dynamic panels. We combine the Monte Carlo test (MCT) and the indirect inference estimation (IIE) principles to construct confidence regions for autoregressive panel parameters with valid coverage whether mean-stationarity is imposed or relaxed and whether autoregressive roots are at or close to the unit boundary or far from unity. Procedures are based on the standard least squares dummy variables (LSDV) estimator and an augmented counterpart which we introduce to restore finite sample exactness in mean-nonstationary settings. We also put forth a ‘Durbin–Wu–Hausman-type’ test for mean-stationarity given a tested autoregressive parameter, based on the distance between the LSDV and its augmented counterpart. Location-scale invariance is shown analytically, and the MCT methods involve multiple stages that preserve exchangeability. The above are formally shown to control size exactly for finite N and T, and provide a new perspective to a literature that is primarily asymptotic. The advantages of the proposed approaches are also illustrated via comparative simulation studies. The identification problems arising from relaxing mean-stationarity are assessed and addressed; we also consider heteroskedastic directions. Results show concrete promise even with very small sample sizes and more broadly, underscore the usefulness of combining MCT and IIE principles.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301433
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Randomization inference for difference-in-differences with few treated clusters,James MacKinnon and Matthew Webb,"Inference using difference-in-differences with clustered data requires care. Previous research has shown that, when there are few treated clusters, t-tests based on cluster-robust variance estimators (CRVEs) severely overreject, and different variants of the wild cluster bootstrap can either overreject or underreject dramatically. We study two randomization inference (RI) procedures. A procedure based on estimated coefficients may be unreliable when clusters are heterogeneous. A procedure based on t-statistics typically performs better (although by no means perfectly) under the null, but at the cost of some power loss. An empirical example demonstrates that RI procedures can yield inferences that differ dramatically from those of other methods.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301445

As a result, there have been several attempts to alleviate the computational burden by use of approximations. In this paper, we extend the fast double bootstrap of Davidson and MacKinnon (2007) to higher orders of iteration, and provide algorithms for their implementation. The new methods make computational demands that increase only linearly with the level of iteration, unlike standard procedures, whose demands increase exponentially. In a series of simulation experiments, we show that the fast triple bootstrap improves on both the standard and fast double bootstraps, in the sense that it suffers from less size distortion under the null with no accompanying loss of power.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301457

This is important to capture the bias of the OLS estimator derived recently by Gonçalves and Perron (2014). We first show that a common approach of resampling cross sectional vectors over time is invalid in this context because it induces a zero bias. We then propose the cross-sectional dependent (CSD) bootstrap where bootstrap samples are obtained by taking a random vector and multiplying it by the square root of a consistent estimator of the covariance matrix of the idiosyncratic errors. We show that if the covariance matrix estimator is consistent in the spectral norm, then the CSD bootstrap is consistent, and we verify this condition for the thresholding estimator of Bickel and Levina (2008). Finally, we apply our new bootstrap procedure to forecasting inflation using convenience yields as recently explored by Gospodinov and Ng (2013).",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301469

The framework is useful for a number of applications including those in economic policy evaluation based on discontinuities or kinks and in real-time financial risk management. We focus on the criterion-function-based (in particular, empirical likelihood-based) inference, and establish conditions under which the test statistic has a pivotal asymptotic distribution. In the key step of eliminating nuisance parameters in the (possibly non-smooth) criterion function, we consider two different approaches based on either concentration or Laplace-type plug-in estimation. The former is natural, and the latter does not require optimization and can be computationally attractive in applications. Our framework can easily incorporate bias correction induced by localization, and the inference is robust to the identification strength of the parameter of interest. The high-level assumptions are illustrated with several examples.

We derive the asymptotic distributions of the corresponding likelihood ratio test statistics and compute the Bartlett adjustments. The results are non-trivial because the unrestricted state space model is not (even locally) identified. We apply our analysis to test the validity of the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Simple and reliable estimators of coefficients of interest in a model with high-dimensional confounding effects,John Galbraith and Victoria Zinde-Walsh,"Often an investigator is interested in a single parameter or low-dimensional parameter vector (e.g. a treatment effect) in a regression model, rather than in the full set of regression coefficients. There may also be a relatively high-dimensional set of potential explanatory variables other than the effect of interest which, if omitted, could bias the estimate of the parameter of interest. However there may be too many such variables to include all of them without substantial efficiency loss. We suggest a simple, easily computed estimator for this case, using principal components to compute auxiliary regressors from the set of potential controls, and establish the limit properties of the estimator allowing for dependence and heterogeneity as well as increasing dimension of the set of controls. We also provide finite-sample evidence on the performance of the estimator where principal components are selected in a one-dimensional search using an appropriate information criterion as stopping rule for the number of components.

The procedure involves multiple parsimonious regression models where key regressors are split across simple regressions. Each parsimonious regression model has one key regressor and other regressors not associated with the null hypothesis. The test is based on the maximum of the squared parameters of the key regressors. Parsimony ensures sharper estimates and therefore improves power in small sample.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Volatility regressions with fat tails,Jihyun Kim and Nour Meddahi,"Nowadays, a common method to forecast integrated variance is to use the fitted value of a simple OLS autoregression of the realized variance. However, non-parametric estimates of the tail index of this realized variance process reveal that its second moment is possibly unbounded. In this case, the behavior of the OLS estimators and the corresponding statistics are unclear. We prove that when the second moment of the spot variance is unbounded, the slope of the spot variance’s autoregression converges to a random variable as the sample size diverges. The same result holds when one uses the integrated or realized variance instead of the spot variance. We then consider the class of diffusion variance models with an affine drift, a class which includes GARCH and CEV processes, and we prove that IV estimation with adequate instruments provide consistent estimators of the drift parameters as long as the variance process has a finite first moment regardless of the existence of the second moment. In particular, for the GARCH diffusion model with fat tails, an IV estimation where the instrument equals the sign of the centered lagged value of the variable of interest provides consistent estimators.

This paper shows that, in general, there is a multiplicity of stationary dynamic equilibria due to the existence of nonlinear stationary equilibria. These nonlinear stationary equilibria are consistent with the self-fulfilling prophecies that characterize the rational expectation equilibria, and can display speculative bubbles, volatility induced mean reversion and/or stochastic autoregressive patterns. They are also compatible with the transversality conditions when the model involves intertemporal optimization. The stationary nonlinear dynamic equilibria are economically relevant. Their analysis requires revised methods of identification for the stationary equilibrium, impulse response analysis, and estimation techniques, which are presented in this paper. Standard econometric and economic methods, which ignore the nonlinear stationary solutions provide misleading outcomes, which may affect the validity of an economic policy or portfolio strategy.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762030155X
Journal of Econometrics,2020,A Simple R-estimation method for semiparametric duration models,Marc Hallin and Davide La Vecchia,"Modeling nonnegative financial variables (e.g. durations between trades or volatilities) is central to a number of studies across econometrics, and still poses several statistical challenges. Among them, the efficiency aspects of semiparametric estimation remain pivotal. In this paper, we concentrate on estimation problems in autoregressive conditional duration models with unspecified innovation densities. Exponential quasi-likelihood estimators (QMLE) are the usual practice in that context, since they are easy-to-implement and preserve Fisher-consistency. However, the efficiency of the QMLE rapidly deteriorates away from the reference exponential density. To cope with the QMLE’s lack of accuracy, semiparametrically efficient procedures have been introduced. These procedures are obtained using the classical tangent space approach; they require kernel estimation and quite large sample sizes. We propose rank-based estimators (R-estimators) as a substitute. Just as the QMLE, R-estimators remain root-n consistent, irrespective of the underlying density, and rely on the choice of a reference density (which, however, needs not be the exponential one), under which they achieve semiparametric efficiency. Moreover, R-estimators neither require tangent space calculations nor kernel estimation. Numerical results illustrate that R-estimators based on the exponential reference density outperform the QMLE under a large class of actual innovation densities, such as the Weibull or Burr densities. A real-data example about modeling the price range of the Swiss stock market index concludes the paper.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620301561

The usefulness of the new procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study and by examining the ability of a group of financial variables to predict excess stock returns. We find some evidence of predictability during the period 1948–2014, driven entirely by the term spread.

We generalize PCA with a penalty term accounting for the pricing error in expected returns. Our estimator searches for factors that can explain both the expected return and covariance structure. We derive the statistical properties of the new estimator and show that our estimator can find asset-pricing factors, which cannot be detected with PCA, even if a large amount of data is available.

Using an infill asymptotic design, we derive limit theorems for the percentage of zero returns observed on a finite time interval and for other related quantities. Within this framework, we develop two nonparametric tests. First, we test whether intra-day zero returns are independent and identically distributed. Second, we test whether intra-day variation of the likelihood of occurrence of zero returns can be solely explained by a deterministic diurnal pattern. In an empirical application to ten representative stocks of the NYSE, we provide evidence that the null of independent and identically distributed intra-day zero returns can be conclusively rejected. We further find that a deterministic diurnal pattern is not sufficient to explain the intra-day variability of the distribution of zero returns.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300270

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Reducing the state space dimension in a large TVP-VAR,"Joshua Chan, Eric Eisenstat and Rodney Strachan","This paper proposes a new approach to estimating high dimensional time varying parameter structural vector autoregressive models (TVP-SVARs) by taking advantage of an empirical feature of TVP-(S)VARs. TVP-(S)VAR models are rarely used with more than 4–5 variables. However recent work has shown the advantages of modelling VARs with large numbers of variables and interest has naturally increased in modelling large dimensional TVP-VARs. A feature that has not yet been utilized is that the covariance matrix for the state equation, when estimated freely, is often near singular. We propose a specification that uses this singularity to develop a factor-like structure to estimate a TVP-SVAR for many variables. Using a generalization of the recentering approach, a rank reduced state covariance matrix and judicious parameter expansions, we obtain efficient and simple computation of a high dimensional TVP-SVAR. An advantage of our approach is that we retain a formal inferential framework such that we can propose formal inference on impulse responses, variance decompositions and, important for our model, the rank of the state equation covariance matrix. In a system with 15 variables, we show clear empirical evidence in favour of our model and improvements in estimates of impulse responses.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300348

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Asymptotic F tests under possibly weak identification,"Julian Martinez-Iriarte, Yixiao Sun and Xuexin Wang","This paper develops asymptotic F tests robust to weak identification and temporal dependence. The test statistics we focus on are modified versions of the S statistic of Stock and Wright (2000) and the K statistic of Kleibergen (2005). In the former case, the modification involves only a multiplicative degree-of-freedom adjustment, and the modified S statistic is asymptotically F distributed under fixed-smoothing asymptotics regardless of the strength of the model identification. In the latter case, the modification involves an additional multiplicative adjustment that uses a J statistic for testing overidentification. We show that the modified K statistic is asymptotically F-distributed when the model parameters are completely unidentified or nearly-weakly identified. When the model parameters are weakly identified, the F approximation for the K statistic can be justified under the conventional asymptotics. The F approximations account for the estimation errors in the underlying heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust variance estimators, which the chi-squared approximations ignore. Monte Carlo simulations show that the F approximations are much more accurate than the corresponding chi-squared approximations in finite samples.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300063
Journal of Econometrics,2020,On the unbiased asymptotic normality of quantile regression with fixed effects,"Antonio Galvao, Jiaying Gu and Stanislav Volgushev","Nonlinear panel data models with fixed individual effects provide an important set of tools for describing microeconometric data. In a large class of such models (including probit, proportional hazard and quantile regression to name just a few) it is impossible to difference out the individual effects, and inference is usually justified in a ‘large n large T’ asymptotic framework. However, there is a considerable gap in the type of assumptions that are currently imposed in models with smooth score functions (such as probit, and proportional hazard) and quantile regression. In the present paper we show that this gap can be bridged and establish unbiased asymptotic normality for fixed effects quantile regression panels under conditions on n,T that are very close to what is typically assumed in standard nonlinear panels. Our results considerably improve upon existing theory and show that quantile regression is applicable to the same type of panel data (in terms of n,T) as other commonly used nonlinear panel data models.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Regression discontinuity design with many thresholds,Marinho Bertanha,"Numerous empirical studies employ regression discontinuity designs with multiple cutoffs and heterogeneous treatments. A common practice is to normalize all the cutoffs to zero and estimate one effect. This procedure identifies the average treatment effect (ATE) on the observed distribution of individuals local to existing cutoffs. However, researchers often want to make inferences on more meaningful ATEs, computed over general counterfactual distributions of individuals, rather than simply the observed distribution of individuals local to existing cutoffs. This paper proposes a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator for such ATEs when heterogeneity follows a non-parametric function of cutoff characteristics in the sharp case. The proposed estimator converges at the minimax optimal rate of root-n for a specific choice of tuning parameters. Identification in the fuzzy case, with multiple cutoffs, is impossible unless heterogeneity follows a finite-dimensional function of cutoff characteristics. Under parametric heterogeneity, this paper proposes an ATE estimator for the fuzzy case that optimally combines observations to maximize its precision.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300361

Market liquidity and volume are important to explaining volatility dynamics but not vice versa. In addition, market dynamics change during the financial crisis, with all variables exhibiting increased responsiveness to their most recent realizations.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,The leverage effect puzzle revisited: Identification in discrete time,"Hyojin Han, Stanislav Khrapov and Eric Renault","The term “leverage effect,” as coined by Black (1976), refers to the tendency of an asset’s volatility to be negatively correlated with the asset’s return. Aït-Sahalia et al. (2013) refer to the “leverage effect puzzle” as the fact that, in spite of a broad agreement that the effect should be present, it is hard to identify empirically. For this purpose, we propose an extension with leverage effect of the discrete time stochastic volatility model of Darolles et al. (2006). This extension is shown to be the natural discrete time analog of the Heston (1993) option pricing model. It shares with Heston (1993) the advantage of structure preserving change of measure: with an exponentially affine stochastic discount factor, the historical and the risk neutral models belong to the same family of joint probability distributions for return and volatility processes. The discrete time approach allows us to make the role of various parameters more transparent: leverage versus volatility feedback effect, connection with daily realized volatility, impact of leverage on the volatility smile, etc. Even more importantly it sheds some new light on the identification of leverage effect and of the various risk premium parameters through link functions in closed form. The price of volatility risk is identified from underlying asset return data, even without option price data, if and only if leverage effect is present. However, the link functions are almost flat if the leverage effect is close to zero, making estimation of the volatility risk price difficult and paving the way for identification robust inference.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619302490
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Volatility estimation and jump detection for drift–diffusion processes,Sébastien Laurent and Shuping Shi,"The logarithmic prices of financial assets are conventionally assumed to follow a drift–diffusion process. While the drift term is typically ignored in the infill asymptotic theory and applications, the presence of temporary nonzero drifts is an undeniable fact. The finite sample theory for integrated variance estimators and extensive simulations provided in this paper reveal that the drift component has a nonnegligible impact on the estimation accuracy of volatility, which leads to a dramatic power loss for a class of jump identification procedures. We propose an alternative construction of volatility estimators and observe significant improvement in the estimation accuracy in the presence of nonnegligible drift. The analytical formulas of the finite sample bias of the realized variance, bipower variation, and their modified versions take simple and intuitive forms. The new jump tests, which are constructed from the modified volatility estimators, show satisfactory performance.

We construct a non-parametric test for spanning based on subsampling, and derive its asymptotic exactness and consistency. The spanning methodology determines whether introducing new securities or relaxing investment constraints improves the investment opportunity set of investors driven by Markowitz stochastic dominance.

A regime switching structure accommodates for periods of unusually high volatility, heterogeneous dynamics and changes in the dependence between the latent states. The model allows separating the continuous component of the variance risk premium from the impact of jumps on option implied variance expectations. Using options and high frequency returns for the S&P500 index, we explain what is generating return predictability by disentangling the part of the variance risk premium associated with normal sized price fluctuations from that associated with tail events.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Partially censored posterior for robust and efficient risk evaluation,"Agnieszka Borowska, Lennart Hoogerheide, Siem Jan Koopman and Herman van Dijk","A novel approach to inference for a specific region of the predictive distribution is introduced. An important domain of application is accurate prediction of financial risk measures, where the area of interest is the left tail of the predictive density of logreturns. Our proposed approach originates from the Bayesian approach to parameter estimation and time series forecasting, however it is robust in the sense that it provides a more accurate estimation of the predictive density in the region of interest in case of misspecification. The first main contribution of the paper is the novel concept of the Partially Censored Posterior (PCP), where the set of model parameters is partitioned into two subsets: for the first subset of parameters we consider the standard marginal posterior, for the second subset of parameters (that are particularly related to the region of interest) we consider the conditional censored posterior. The censoring means that observations outside the region of interest are censored: for those observations only the probability of being outside the region of interest matters. This quasi-Bayesian approach yields more precise parameter estimation than a fully censored posterior for all parameters, and has more focus on the region of interest than a standard Bayesian approach. The second main contribution is that we introduce two novel methods for computationally efficient simulation: Conditional MitISEM, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to simulate model parameters from the Partially Censored Posterior, and PCP-QERMit, an Importance Sampling method that is introduced to further decrease the numerical standard errors of the Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall estimators. The third main contribution is that we consider the effect of using a time-varying boundary of the region of interest.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Virtual Historical Simulation for estimating the conditional VaR of large portfolios,Christian Francq and Jean-Michel Zakoian,"In order to estimate the conditional risk of a portfolio’s return, two strategies can be advocated. A multivariate strategy requires estimating a dynamic model for the vector of risk factors, which is often challenging, when at all possible, for large portfolios. A univariate approach based on a dynamic model for the portfolio’s return seems more attractive. However, when the combination of the individual returns is time varying, the portfolio’s return series is typically non stationary which may invalidate statistical inference. An alternative approach consists in reconstituting a ”virtual portfolio”, whose returns are built using the current composition of the portfolio and for which a stationary dynamic model can be estimated.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Flexible multivariate Hill estimators,"Yves Dominicy, Matias Heikkilä, Pauliina Ilmonen and David Veredas","Dominicy et al. (2017) introduce a family of Hill estimators for elliptically distributed and heavy tailed random vectors. They propose to use the univariate Hill to a norm of order h of the data. The norms are homogeneous functions of order one. We show that the family of estimators can be generalized to homogeneous functions of any order and, more importantly, that ellipticity is not required. Only multivariate regular variation is needed, as it is preserved under well-behaved homogeneous functions. This enables us to have flexibility in terms of the estimator and the underlying distribution.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Multivariate leverage effects and realized semicovariance GARCH models,"Tim Bollerslev, Andrew Patton and Rogier Quaedvlieg","We propose new asymmetric multivariate volatility models. The models exploit estimates of variances and covariances based on the signs of high-frequency returns, measures known as realized semivariances, semicovariances, and semicorrelations, to allow for more nuanced responses to positive and negative return shocks than threshold “leverage effect” terms traditionally used in the literature. Our empirical implementations of the new models, including extensions of widely-used bivariate GARCH specifications for a number of individual stocks and the aggregate market portfolio as well as larger dimensional dynamic conditional correlation type formulations for a cross-section of individual stocks, provide clear evidence of improved model fit and reveal new and interesting asymmetric joint dynamic dependencies.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619302581
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Estimation of a multiplicative correlation structure in the large dimensional case,"Christian Hafner, Oliver Linton and Haihan Tang","We propose a Kronecker product model for correlation or covariance matrices in the large dimensional case.

We propose a minimum distance (MD) estimator based on a log-linear property of the model, as well as a one-step estimator, which is a one-step approximation to the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE). We establish rates of convergence and central limit theorems (CLT) for our estimators in the large dimensional case. A specification test and tools for Kronecker product model selection and inference are provided. In a Monte Carlo study where a Kronecker product model is correctly specified, our estimators exhibit superior performance. In an empirical application to portfolio choice for S&P500 daily returns, we demonstrate that certain Kronecker product models are good approximations to the general covariance matrix.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619302593
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Incorporating overnight and intraday returns into multivariate GARCH volatility models,Geert Dhaene and Jianbin Wu,"We propose and evaluate mixed-frequency multivariate GARCH models for forecasting low-frequency (weekly) volatility based on high-frequency intraday returns (at 5-minute intervals) and on the overnight returns. The low-frequency conditional volatility matrix is modeled as a weighted sum of an intraday and an overnight component. The components are specified as multivariate GARCH processes of the BEKK type, adapted to the mixed-frequency data setting, and may enter the model as two separate components or as a single one. The models may further be extended by a nonparametrically estimated slowly-varying long-run volatility matrix. We evaluate the models in and out of sample using the 5-minute and overnight returns on four DJIA stocks (AXP, GE, HD, and IBM) from January 1988 to November 2014 and find that they systematically dominate a variety of models that only use lower-frequency data (weekly, daily, or close-to-open and open-to-close returns).",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440761930260X

This setup in particular covers interesting models for conditional distributions, such as quantile regression or distribution regression.

We investigate empirically the comparative influence of high and low frequency traders on the price process, and conversely the influence of the price process on the trading of high and low frequency traders. We find that high frequency traders have a particularly high success rate on each transaction, measured by the likelihood that the following price change will go in their direction as well as by the amount of time they have to wait to realize their gain, when trading against low frequency traders. Contrary to common wisdom, we find that high frequency traders’ activity does not induce volatility or jumps. In fact, it is their absence that is problematic: volatility and jumps are more prevalent in periods when they trade less intensely. Conversely, we find that spikes in volatility and jumps cause high frequency traders to trade less intensely, decreasing their provision of liquidity. Finally, looking at the market microstructure noise component to the price model, we find that higher level of noise generates trading opportunities for high frequency traders and lead them to increase their trading activity.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619302428

However, many specifications suffer from an over-parametrization issue, since typically all parameters have to change when a break occurs. We introduce a sparse change-point model to detect which parameters change over time. We propose a shrinkage prior distribution, which controls model parsimony by limiting the number of parameters that change from one structural break to another. We develop a Bayesian sampler for inference on the sparse change-point model. An extensive simulation study based on AR, ARMA and GARCH processes highlights the excellent performance of the sampler.

We establish the consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency of our semiparametric estimation procedures. We extend the modelling to the multivariate case where we allow time varying correlation between stocks. We apply our model to the study of Dow Jones industrial average component stocks and CRSP size-based portfolios over the period 1993–2017.

We establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality for parameters defined through survey weighted smooth or non-differentiable estimating functions even if the “plug-in” estimator for the nuisance functional has a convergence rate slower than root-n. A multiplier bootstrap procedure is proposed for three types of commonly used survey designs to tackle the challenge task of variance estimation.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,"Generalized dynamic factor models and volatilities: Consistency, rates, and prediction intervals",Matteo Barigozzi and Marc Hallin,"Volatilities, in high-dimensional panels of economic time series with a dynamic factor structure on the levels or returns, typically also admit a dynamic factor decomposition. We consider a two-stage dynamic factor model method recovering the common and idiosyncratic components of both levels and log-volatilities. Specifically, in a first estimation step, we extract the common and idiosyncratic shocks for the levels, from which a log-volatility proxy is computed. In a second step, we estimate a dynamic factor model, which is equivalent to a multiplicative factor structure for volatilities, for the log-volatility panel. By exploiting this two-stage factor approach, we build one-step-ahead conditional prediction intervals for large n×T panels of returns. Those intervals are based on empirical quantiles, not on conditional variances; they can be either equal- or unequal-tailed. We provide uniform consistency and consistency rates results for the proposed estimators as both n and T tend to infinity. We study the finite-sample properties of our estimators by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we apply our methodology to a panel of asset returns belonging to the S&P100 index in order to compute one-step-ahead conditional prediction intervals for the period 2006–2013.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,A robust procedure to build dynamic factor models with cluster structure,"Andrés M. Alonso, Pedro Galeano and Daniel Peña","Dynamic factor models provide a useful way to model large sets of time series. These data often have heterogeneity and cluster structure and the formulation and estimation of dynamic factor models should be adapted to these features. This article presents a procedure to fit Dynamic Factor Models with Cluster Structure (DFMCS), where some of the factors are global and others group-specific, to heterogeneous data that may include multivariate additive outliers and level shifts. The procedure starts with an initial cleaning of the times series from outlying effects. Then a first estimation of the possible factors is applied to the cleaned data and these factors are used to build the common component of each series. The groups are found by studying the joint dependency of these common components. Then, additional factors are estimated by using the series in each cluster and, finally, all the factors found are classified as global or group-specific. We show in a Monte Carlo study that the procedure works well and seems to be better than other alternatives in terms of estimation of factors and loadings as well as in terms of misclassification rates for the series. An example of an electricity market is presented to illustrate the advantages of cleaning for outliers and taking into account the cluster structure for understanding and forecasting.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300099

This is an extension of threshold modeling to a high-dimensional time series setting under a factor structure. Specifically, within each threshold regime, the time series is assumed to follow a factor model. The regime switching mechanism creates structural changes in the factor loading matrices. It provides flexibility in dealing with situations that the underlying states may be changing over time, as often observed in economic time series and other applications.

Most commonly-used model selection methods fail to consistently recover the true model when the covariates are highly correlated. Motivated by econometric and financial studies, we consider the case where covariate dependence can be reduced through the factor model, and propose a consistency strategy named Factor-Adjusted Regularized Model Selection (FarmSelect). By learning the latent factors and idiosyncratic components and using both of them as predictors, FarmSelect transforms the problem from model selection with highly correlated covariates to that with weakly correlated ones via lifting. Model selection consistency, as well as optimal rates of convergence, are obtained under mild conditions. Numerical studies demonstrate the nice finite sample performance in terms of both model selection and out-of-sample prediction. Moreover, our method is flexible in the sense that it pays no price for weakly correlated and uncorrelated cases.

The proposed test makes use of the robust properties of Spearman’s rank correlation and the theory of extreme values. Asymptotic properties of the test statistics are derived under some minor conditions as both the sample size and dimension go to infinity. The test is not sensitive to the underlying distribution of the time series so long as the data are continuously distributed. In particular, the existence of finite-order moments of the underlying distribution is not required, and asymptotic critical values of the test statistics are available in closed form. In finite samples, we correct biases of the sample autocorrelations and conduct simulations to study the performance of the proposed test statistics. Simulation results show that the proposed test statistics enjoy good properties of size and power in finite samples. We apply the proposed test to a 92-dimensional series of asset returns.

In this article, we consider the problem of selecting high-dimensional regression models with heteroscedastic and time series errors, which have broad applications in economics, quantitative finance, environmental science, and many other fields. The error term in our model is the product of two components: one time series component, allowing for a short-memory, long-memory, or conditional heteroscedasticity effect, and a high-dimensional dispersion function accounting for exogenous heteroscedasticity. By making use of the orthogonal greedy algorithm and the high-dimensional information criterion, we propose a new model selection procedure that consistently chooses the relevant variables in both the regression and the dispersion functions.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Estimation for double-nonlinear cointegration,"Yingqian Lin, Yundong Tu and Qiwei Yao","In recent years statistical inference for nonlinear cointegration has attracted attention from both academics and practitioners. This paper proposes a new type of cointegration in the sense that two univariate time series yt and xt are cointegrated via two (unknown) smooth nonlinear transformations, further generalizing the notion of cointegration initially revealed by Box and Tiao (1977), and more systematically studied by Engle and Granger (1987). More precisely, it holds that G(yt,β0)=g(xt)+ut, where G(⋅,β0) is strictly increasing and known up to an unknown parameter β0, g(⋅) is unknown and smooth, xt is I(1), and ut is the stationary disturbance. This setting nests the nonlinear cointegration model of Wang and Phillips (2009b) as a special case with G(y,β0)=y. It extends the model of Linton et al. (2008) to the cases with a unit-root nonstationary regressor. Sieve approximations to the smooth nonparametric function g are applied, leading to an extremum estimator for β and a plugging-in estimator for g(⋅). Asymptotic properties of the estimators are established, revealing that both the convergence rates and the limiting distributions depend intimately on the properties of the two nonlinear transformation functions. Simulation studies demonstrate that the estimators perform well even with small samples. A real data example on the environmental Kuznets curve portraying the nonlinear impact of per-capita GDP on air-pollution illustrates the practical relevance of the proposed double-nonlinear cointegration.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300178
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Asymptotic theory for near integrated processes driven by tempered linear processes,"Farzad Sabzikar, Qiying Wang and Peter Phillips","In an early article on near-unit root autoregression, Ahtola and Tiao (1984) studied the behavior of the score function in a stationary first order autoregression driven by independent Gaussian innovations as the autoregressive coefficient approached unity from below. The present paper develops asymptotic theory for near-integrated random processes and associated regressions including the score function in more general settings where the errors are tempered linear processes. Tempered processes are stationary time series that have a semi-long memory property in the sense that the autocovariogram of the process resembles that of a long memory model for moderate lags but eventually diminishes exponentially fast according to the presence of a decay factor governed by a tempering parameter. When the tempering parameter is sample size dependent, the resulting class of processes admits a wide range of behavior that includes both long memory, semi-long memory, and short memory processes. The paper develops asymptotic theory for such processes and associated regression statistics thereby extending earlier findings that fall within certain subclasses of processes involving near-integrated time series. The limit results relate to tempered fractional processes that include tempered fractional Brownian motion and tempered fractional diffusions of the second kind. The theory is extended to provide the limiting distribution for autoregressions with such tempered near-integrated time series, thereby enabling analysis of the limit properties of statistics of particular interest in econometrics, such as unit root tests, under more general conditions than existing theory. Some extensions of the theory to the multivariate case are reported.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762030018X

To estimate the model, a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is developed with high computational cost. To alleviate the computational burden, a least squares estimator is proposed, which is applicable in large-scale networks. The least squares estimator can be viewed as one particular type of generalized methods of moments estimator. The theoretical properties of both estimators are investigated. The finite sample performances are assessed through simulations and a real data example.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300191
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Inference for the degree distributions of preferential attachment networks with zero-degree nodes,"N.H. Chan, Simon K.C. Cheung and Samuel P.S. Wong","The tail of the logarithmic degree distribution of networks decays linearly with respect to the logarithmic degree is known as the power law and is ubiquitous in daily lives. A commonly used technique in modeling the power law is preferential attachment (PA), which sequentially joins each new node to the existing nodes according to the conditional probability law proportional to a linear function of their degrees. Although effective, it is tricky to apply PA to real networks because the number of nodes and that of edges have to satisfy a linear constraint. This paper enables real application of PA by making each new node as an isolated node that attaches to other nodes according to PA scheme in some later epochs. This simple and novel strategy provides an additional degree of freedom to relax the aforementioned constraint to the observed data and uses the PA scheme to compute the implied proportion of the unobserved zero-degree nodes. By using martingale convergence theory, the degree distribution of the proposed model is shown to follow the power law and its asymptotic variance is proved to be the solution of a Sylvester matrix equation, a class of equations frequently found in the control theory (see Hansen and Sargent (2008, 2014)). These results give a strongly consistent estimator for the power-law parameter and its asymptotic normality. Note that this statistical inference procedure is non-iterative and is particularly applicable for big networks such as the World Wide Web presented in Section 6. Moreover, the proposed model offers a theoretically coherent framework that can be used to study other network features, such as clustering and connectedness, as given in Cheung (2016).",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300208

First, we introduce a measure of dependence for vector nonparametric linear processes, and derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic by Taniguchi et al. (1996) in the infinite variance case. Second, we construct a weighted version of the generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) test statistic, called the self-weighted GEL statistic in the time domain. The limiting distribution of the self-weighted GEL test statistic is shown to be the usual chi-squared one regardless of whether the model has finite variance or not.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Noncausal vector AR processes with application to economic time series,Richard A.

For such processes, the observation at time t may depend on both past and future shocks in the system. In this paper, we consider extension of the univariate noncausal AR models to the vector AR (VAR) case. The extension presents several interesting challenges since even a first-order VAR can possess both causal and noncausal components. Assuming a non-Gaussian distribution for the noise, we show how to compute an approximation to the likelihood function. Under suitable conditions, it is shown that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the vector of AR parameters is asymptotically normal. The estimation procedure is illustrated with a simulation study for a VAR(1) process and with two real data examples.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300221
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Double machine learning with gradient boosting and its application to the Big N audit quality effect,"Jui-Chung Yang, Hui-Ching Chuang and Chung-Ming Kuan","In this paper, we study the double machine learning (DML) approach of Chernozhukov et al. (2018) for estimating average treatment effect and apply this approach to examine the Big N audit quality effect in the accounting literature. This approach relies on machine learning methods and is suitable when a high dimensional nuisance function with many covariates is present in the model. This approach does not suffer from the “regularization bias” when a learning method with a proper convergence rate is used. We demonstrate by simulations that, for the DML approach, the gradient boosting method is fairly robust and to be preferred to other methods, such as regression tree, random forest, support vector regression machine, and the conventional Nadaraya–Watson nonparametric estimator. We then apply the DML approach with gradient boosting to estimate the Big N effect. We find that Big N auditors have a positive effect on audit quality and that this effect is not only statistically significant but also economically important. We further show that, in contrast to the results of propensity score matching, our estimates of said effect are quite robust to the hyper-parameters in the gradient boosting algorithm.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620300245

Another benchmark discriminant is the naive Bayes, which is based on marginals only. In this paper we extend both discriminants by modeling dependence between pairs of variables. In the continuous case this is done by local Gaussian versions of the Fisher discriminant. In the discrete case the naive Bayes is extended by taking geometric averages of pairwise joint probabilities. We also indicate how the two approaches can be combined for mixed continuous and discrete data.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Multiscale clustering of nonparametric regression curves,Michael Vogt and Oliver Linton,"In a wide range of modern applications, one observes a large number of time series rather than only a single one. It is often natural to suppose that there is some group structure in the observed time series. When each time series is modeled by a nonparametric regression equation, one may in particular assume that the observed time series can be partitioned into a small number of groups whose members share the same nonparametric regression function. We develop a bandwidth-free clustering method to estimate the unknown group structure from the data. More precisely speaking, we construct multiscale estimators of the unknown groups and their unknown number which are free of classical bandwidth or smoothing parameters. In the theoretical part of the paper, we analyze the statistical properties of our estimators. Our theoretical results are derived under general conditions which allow the data to be dependent both in time series direction and across different time series.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,The uniform validity of impulse response inference in autoregressions,Atsushi Inoue and Lutz Kilian,"Existing proofs of the asymptotic validity of conventional methods of impulse response inference based on higher-order autoregressions are pointwise only. In this paper, we establish the uniform asymptotic validity of conventional asymptotic and bootstrap inference about individual impulse responses and vectors of impulse responses when the horizon is fixed with respect to the sample size. For inference about vectors of impulse responses based on Wald test statistics to be uniformly valid, lag-augmented autoregressions are required, whereas inference about individual impulse responses is uniformly valid under weak conditions even without lag augmentation. We introduce a new rank condition that ensures the uniform validity of inference on impulse responses and show that this condition holds under weak conditions. Simulations show that the highest finite-sample accuracy is achieved when bootstrapping the lag-augmented autoregression using the bias adjustments of Kilian (1999). The conventional bootstrap percentile interval for impulse responses based on this approach remains accurate even at long horizons. We provide a formal asymptotic justification for this result.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619302040

Counterfactual CCPs induced by innovations to state transitions are generally not identified unless the model exhibits single action finite dependence, and the payoffs of those actions establishing single action finite dependence are known.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619302064
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Time-invariant restrictions of volatility functionals: Efficient estimation and specification tests,Xiye Yang,"This paper studies the estimation and inference problems of time-invariant restrictions on certain known functions of the stochastic volatility process. We first develop a more efficient GMM estimator and derive the efficiency bound under such restrictions. Then we construct an integrated Hausman-type test by summing up the squared differences between this more efficient estimator and the unrestricted estimator computed at different time points. Although less efficient under the null, the latter estimator is consistent under both the null and the alternative. The efficient GMM estimator can also be used to update an existing Bierens-type test and simplify the calculation of the asymptotic variance. Since the quadratic function puts more weight on large values, the Hausman-type test can have superior power than the Bierens-type test, which is based on a linear function of the differences. The simulation study shows that except for very small local window sizes, the Hausman-type test has good size and superior power.

Accounting for these issues, we find stronger evidence of a significant average VSP both at the index level and also for equities.

Next, we employ these estimators to adapt the pre-averaging method and derive consistent estimators of the IV, which converge stably to a mixed Gaussian distribution at the optimal rate n1∕4. To improve the finite sample performance, we propose a multi-step approach that corrects the finite sample bias, which turns out to be crucial in applications.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Issues in the estimation of mis-specified models of fractionally integrated processes,"Gael M. Martin, K. Nadarajah and Donald Poskitt","This short paper provides a comprehensive set of new theoretical results on the impact of mis-specifying the short run dynamics in fractionally integrated processes. We show that four alternative parametric estimators – frequency domain maximum likelihood, Whittle, time domain maximum likelihood and conditional sum of squares – converge to the same pseudo-true value under common mis-specification, and that they possess a common asymptotic distribution. The results are derived assuming the true data generating mechanism is a fractional linear process driven by a martingale difference innovation. A completely general parametric specification for the short run dynamics of the estimated (mis-specified) fractional model is considered, and with long memory, short memory and antipersistence in both the model and the data generating mechanism accommodated. The paper can be seen as extending an existing line of research on mis-specification in fractional models, important contributions to which have appeared in Journal of Econometrics. It also complements a range of existing asymptotic results on estimation in correctly specified fractional models.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Identification and estimation in panel models with overspecified number of groups,"Ruiqi Liu, Zuofeng Shang, Yonghui Zhang and Qiankun Zhou","We propose a simple and fast approach to identify and estimate the unknown group structure in panel models by adapting the M-estimation method. We consider both linear and nonlinear panel models where the regression coefficients are heterogeneous across groups but homogeneous within a group and the group membership is unknown to researchers. The main result of the paper is that under certain assumptions, our approach is able to provide uniformly consistent estimation as long as the number of groups used in estimation is not smaller than the true number of groups. We also show that, asymptotically, our method may partition some true groups into further subgroups, but cannot mix units from different groups. When the true number of groups is used in estimation, all units can be categorized correctly with probability approaching one, and we establish the limiting distribution for the estimators of the group parameters. In addition, we provide an information criterion to select the number of groups, and establish the consistency of the selection criterion under some mild conditions. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed method. The findings in the simulation confirm our theoretical results in the paper.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Kernel-based Inference in Time-Varying Coefficient Cointegrating Regression,"Degui Li, Peter Phillips and Jiti Gao","This paper studies nonlinear cointegrating models with time-varying coefficients and multiple nonstationary regressors using classic kernel smoothing methods to estimate the coefficient functions. Extending earlier work on nonstationary kernel regression to take account of practical features of the data, we allow the regressors to be cointegrated and to embody a mixture of stochastic and deterministic trends, complications which result in asymptotic degeneracy of the kernel-weighted signal matrix. To address these complications new local and global rotation techniques are introduced to transform the covariate space to accommodate multiple scenarios of induced degeneracy. Under regularity conditions we derive asymptotic results that differ substantially from existing kernel regression asymptotics, leading to new limit theory under multiple convergence rates. For the practically important case of endogenous nonstationary regressors we propose a fully-modified kernel estimator whose limit distribution theory corresponds to the prototypical pure cointegration case (i.e., with exogenous covariates), thereby facilitating inference using a generalized Wald-type test statistic. These results substantially generalize econometric estimation and testing techniques in the cointegration literature to accommodate time variation and complications of co-moving regressors. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulation studies as well as an empirical illustration to aggregate US data on consumption, income, and interest rates are provided to illustrate the methodology and evaluate the numerical performance of the proposed methods in finite samples.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619302210
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Inference for local distributions at high sampling frequencies: A bootstrap approach,Ulrich Hounyo and Rasmus T.

Specifically, we construct a resampling procedure for the empirical CDF of high-frequency innovations that have been standardized using a nonparametric estimate of its stochastic scale (volatility) and truncated to rid the effect of “large” jumps. Our locally dependent wild bootstrap (LDWB) accommodate issues related to the stochastic scale and jumps as well as account for a special block-wise dependence structure induced by sampling errors. We show that the LDWB replicates first and second-order limit theory from the usual empirical process and the stochastic scale estimate, respectively, in addition to an asymptotic bias. Moreover, we design the LDWB sufficiently general to establish asymptotic equivalence between it and a nonparametric local block bootstrap, also introduced here, up to second-order distribution theory. Finally, we introduce LDWB-aided Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests for local Gaussianity as well as local von-Mises statistics, with and without bootstrap inference, and establish their asymptotic validity using the second-order distribution theory. The finite sample performance of CLT and LDWB-aided local Gaussianity tests is assessed in a simulation study and an empirical application. Whereas the CLT test is oversized, even in large samples, the size of the LDWB tests is accurate, even in small samples. The empirical analysis verifies this pattern, in addition to providing new insights about the fine scale distributional properties of innovations to equity indices, commodities and exchange rates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619301836

Since the volatility coefficients might be on the boundary, the statistical inference methods based on the Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (GQMLE) become non-standard, and their asymptotics require the data to have a finite sixth moment, which narrows the applicable scope in studying heavy-tailed data. To overcome this deficiency, this paper develops a systematic statistical inference procedure based on the self-weighted GQMLE for the augmented DAR model. Except for the Lagrange multiplier test statistic, the Wald, quasi-likelihood ratio and portmanteau test statistics are all shown to have non-standard asymptotics.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Identification and estimation of time-varying nonseparable panel data models without stayers,Takuya Ishihara,"This paper explores the identification and estimation of nonseparable panel data models. We show that the structural function is nonparametrically identified when it is strictly increasing in a scalar unobservable variable, the conditional distributions of unobservable variables do not change over time, and the joint support of explanatory variables satisfies some weak assumptions. To identify the target parameters, existing studies assume that the structural function does not change over time, and that there are “stayers”, namely individuals with the same regressor values in two time periods. Our approach, by contrast, allows the structural function to depend on the time period in an arbitrary manner and does not require the existence of stayers. In estimation part of the paper, we propose parametric and nonparametric estimators that implement our identification results. Monte Carlo studies indicate that our parametric estimator performs well in finite samples.

Local asymptotic results are established giving precise descriptions of the time to detection under several of these models, which show that such procedures are powerful to detect a wide range of non-stationary characteristics, including changes in mean, volatility, and unit root behaviour.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Hybrid stochastic local unit roots,Offer Lieberman and Peter Phillips,"Two approaches have dominated formulations designed to capture small departures from unit root autoregressions. The first involves deterministic departures that include local-to-unity (LUR) and mildly (or moderately) integrated (MI) specifications where departures shrink to zero as the sample size n→∞. The second approach allows for stochastic departures from unity, leading to stochastic unit root (STUR) specifications. This paper introduces a hybrid local stochastic unit root (LSTUR) specification that has both LUR and STUR components and allows for endogeneity in the time varying coefficient that introduces structural elements to the autoregression. This hybrid model generates trajectories that, upon normalization, have non-linear diffusion limit processes that link closely to models that have been studied in mathematical finance, particularly with respect to option pricing. It is shown that some LSTUR parameterizations have a mean and variance which are the same as a random walk process but with a kurtosis exceeding 3, a feature which is consistent with much financial data. We develop limit theory and asymptotic expansions for the process and document how inference in LUR and STUR autoregressions is affected asymptotically by ignoring one or the other component in the more general hybrid generating mechanism.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Nonparametric identification of discrete choice models with lagged dependent variables,Benjamin Williams,"Variation in covariates can be used to nonparametrically identify a discrete choice model with a lagged dependent variable and discrete unobserved heterogeneity (Kasahara and Shimotsu, 2009; Browning and Carro, 2014). In some cases the number of support points of the unobserved heterogeneity distribution is restricted only by the number of points of support in the distribution of the covariates. This paper provides conditions under which these models can be identified with continuous heterogeneity using continuous variation in the covariates. The identification argument is related to that of Honore and Lewbel (2002) in that it requires a “special regressor” (Lewbel, 1998), but it does not assume an additively separable latent index. Identification requires only 3 time periods, neither stationarity nor time homogeneity is imposed, and the distribution of the initial condition is not restricted apart from conditions required for the special regressor. I demonstrate the result through a Monte Carlo simulation.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619301812
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Nonparametric filtering of conditional state-price densities,Jeroen Dalderop,This paper studies the use of noisy high-frequency data to estimate the time-varying state-price density implicit in European option prices. A dynamic kernel estimator of the conditional pricing function and its derivatives is proposed that can be used for model-free risk measurement. Infill asymptotic theory is derived that applies when the pricing function is either smoothly varying or driven by diffusive state variables. Trading times and moneyness levels are modeled by marked point processes that capture intraday trading patterns. A simulation study investigates the performance of the estimator using a varying plug-in bandwidth in various scenarios. Empirical analysis using S&P 500 E-mini European option quotes reveals significant time-variation at intraday frequencies. An application towards delta- and minimum variance-hedging further illustrates the use of the estimator.,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440761930168X
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Variance disparity and market frictions,Yang-Ho Park,"This paper introduces a new model-free approach to measuring the expectation of market variance using VIX derivatives. This approach shows that VIX derivatives carry different information about future variance than S&P 500 (SPX) options, especially during the 2008 financial crisis. I find that the segmentation is associated with frictions such as funding illiquidity, market illiquidity, and asymmetric information. When they are segmented, VIX derivatives contribute more to the variance discovery process than SPX options. These findings imply that VIX derivatives would offer a better estimate of expected variance than SPX options, and that a measure of segmentation may be useful for policymakers as it signals the severity of frictions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619301654
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Nonparametric assessment of hedge fund performance,"Caio Almeida, Kym Ardison and René Garcia","We propose a new class of performance measures for Hedge Fund (HF) returns based on a family of empirically identifiable stochastic discount factors (SDFs). The SDF-based measures incorporate no-arbitrage pricing restrictions and naturally embed information about higher-order mixed moments between HF and benchmark factors returns. We provide a full asymptotic theory for our SDF estimators to test for the statistical significance of each fund’s performance and for the relevance of individual benchmark factors within each proposed measure. We apply our methodology to a panel of 4815 individual hedge funds. Our empirical analysis reveals that fewer funds have a statistically significant positive alpha compared to the Jensen’s alpha obtained by the traditional linear regression approach. Moreover, the funds’ rankings vary considerably between the two approaches. Performance also varies between the members of our family because of a different fund exposure to higher-order moments of the benchmark factors, highlighting the potential heterogeneity across investors in evaluating performance.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619301617
Journal of Econometrics,2020,On rank estimators in increasing dimensions,"Yanqin Fan, Fang Han, Wei Li and Xiao-Hua Zhou","The family of rank estimators, including Han’s maximum rank correlation (Han, 1987) as a notable example, has been widely exploited in studying regression problems. For these estimators, although the linear index is introduced for alleviating the impact of dimensionality, the effect of large dimension on inference is rarely studied. This paper fills this gap via studying the statistical properties of a larger family of M-estimators, whose objective functions are formulated as U-processes and may be discontinuous in increasing dimension set-up where the number of parameters, pn, in the model is allowed to increase with the sample size, n. First, we find that often in estimation, as pn∕n→0, (pn∕n)1∕2 rate of convergence is obtainable. Second, we establish Bahadur-type bounds and study the validity of normal approximation, which we find often requires a much stronger scaling requirement than pn2∕n→0. Third, we state conditions under which the numerical derivative estimator of asymptotic covariance matrix is consistent, and show that the step size in implementing the covariance estimator has to be adjusted with respect to pn.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Inference in heavy-tailed vector error correction models,Rui She and Shiqing Ling,"This paper first studies the full rank least squares estimator (FLSE) of the heavy-tailed vector error correction (VEC) models. It is shown that the rate of convergence of the FLSE related to the long-run parameters is n (sample size) and its limiting distribution is a stochastic integral in terms of two stable random processes when the tail index α∈(0,2). Furthermore, we show that the rate of convergence of the FLSE related to the short-term parameters is n1∕αL̃(n) and its limiting distribution is a functional of two stable processes when α∈(1,2), where L̃(n) is a slowly varying function. However, when α∈(0,1), we show that the rate of convergence of the FLSE related to the short-term parameters is n and its limiting distribution not only depends on the stationary component itself but also depends on the unit root component. Based on the FLSE, we then study the limiting behavior of the reduced rank LSE (RLSE). The results related to the short-term parameters of both FLSE and RLSE are significantly different from those of heavy-tailed time series in the literature, and it may provide new insights in the area for future research. Simulation study is carried out to demonstrate the performance of both estimators.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Panel threshold regressions with latent group structures,"Ke Miao, Liangjun Su and Wendun Wang","In this paper, we consider the least squares estimation of a panel structure threshold regression (PSTR) model where both the slope coefficients and threshold parameters may exhibit latent group structures. We study the asymptotic properties of the estimators of the latent group structure and the slope and threshold coefficients. We show that we can estimate the latent group structure correctly with probability approaching 1 and the estimators of the slope and threshold coefficients are asymptotically equivalent to the infeasible estimators that are obtained as if the true group structures were known. We study likelihood-ratio-based inferences on the group-specific threshold parameters under the shrinking-threshold-effect framework. We also propose two specification tests: one tests whether the threshold parameters are homogeneous across groups, and the other tests whether the threshold effects are present. When the number of latent groups is unknown, we propose a BIC-type information criterion to determine the number of groups in the data. Simulations demonstrate that our estimators and tests perform reasonably well in finite samples. We apply our model to revisit the relationship between capital market imperfection and the investment behavior of firms and to examine the impact of bank deregulation on income inequality. We document a large degree of heterogeneous effects in both applications that cannot be captured by conventional panel threshold regressions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619301708

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Modelling regional patterns of inefficiency: A Bayesian approach to geoadditive panel stochastic frontier analysis with an application to cereal production in England and Wales,"Nadja Klein, Helmut Herwartz and Thomas Kneib",We propose a flexible Bayesian approach to inefficiency modelling that accounts for regional patterns of local performance. The model allows for a separated treatment of individual heterogeneity and determinants of inefficiency. Regional dependence structures and location-specific unobserved spatial heterogeneity are modelled via geoadditive predictors in the inefficiency term of the stochastic frontier model. Inference becomes feasible through Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. In an empirical illustration we find that regional patterns of inefficiency characterize cereal production in England and Wales.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Econometric estimates of Earth’s transient climate sensitivity,"Peter Phillips, Thomas Leirvik and Trude Storelvmo","How sensitive is Earth’s climate to a given increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations? This long-standing question in climate science was recently analyzed by dynamic panel data methods using extensive spatio-temporal data of global surface temperatures, solar radiation, and GHG concentrations over the last half century to 2010 (Storelvmo et al, 2016). Those methods revealed that atmospheric aerosol effects masked approximately one-third of the continental warming due to increasing GHG concentrations over this period, thereby implying greater climate sensitivity to GHGs than previously thought. The present study provides regularity conditions and asymptotic theory justifying the use of time series cointegration-based methods of estimation when there are both stochastic process and deterministic trends in the global forcing variables, such as GHGs, and station-level trend effects from such sources as local aerosol pollutants. The asymptotics validate estimation and confidence interval construction for econometric measures of Earth’s transient climate sensitivity (TCS). The methods are applied to observational data and to data generated from several groups of global climate models (GCMs) that are sampled spatio-temporally and aggregated in the same way as the empirical observations for the time period 1964–2005. The findings indicate that 7 out of 9 of the GCM reported TCS values lie within the 95% empirical confidence interval computed econometrically from the GCM output. The analysis shows the potential of econometric methods to provide empirical estimates and confidence limits for TCS, to calibrate GCM simulation output against observational data in terms of the implied TCS estimates obtained via the econometric model, and to reveal the respective sensitivity parameters (GHG and non-GHG related) governing GCM temperature trends.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619301058
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Modeling time series when some observations are zero,Andrew Harvey and Ryoko Ito,"Sometimes a significant proportion of observations in a time series are zero, but the remaining observations are positive and measured on a continuous scale. We propose a new dynamic model in which the conditional distribution of the observations is constructed by shifting a distribution for non-zero observations to the left and censoring negative values. The key to generalizing the censoring approach to the dynamic case is to have (the logarithm of) the location/scale parameter driven by a filter that depends on the score of the conditional distribution. An exponential link function means that seasonal effects can be incorporated into the model and this is done by means of a cubic spline (which can potentially be time-varying). The model is fitted to daily rainfall in locations in northern Australia and England and compared with a dynamic zero-augmented model.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440761930106X

This important climatic time series is subject to an intricate dynamic structure and is interrelated to other climatological variables. The procedure consists of three steps. First, a univariate time series model is considered for producing prediction errors. Second, signal paths of the prediction errors are simulated via a dynamic factor model for the errors and explanatory variables. From these simulated errors, ensemble time series for Niño3.4 are constructed. Third, forecasts are generated from the ensemble time series and their sample average is our final forecast. As part of these dynamic factor simulations, we also obtain the forecast of the El Niño event which is a categorical variable.

We establish the asymptotic validity of the bootstrap method for both pointwise and simultaneous confidence bands under general conditions, allowing for general patterns of missing data, serial dependence and heteroskedasticity.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Inference related to common breaks in a multivariate system with joined segmented trends with applications to global and hemispheric temperatures,"Dukpa Kim, Tatsushi Oka, Francisco Estrada and Pierre Perron","What transpires from recent research is that temperatures and radiative forcing seem to be characterized by a linear trend with two changes in the rate of growth. The first occurs in the early 60s and indicates a very large increase in the rate of growth of both temperature and radiative forcing series. This was termed as the “onset of sustained global warming”. The second is related to the more recent so-called hiatus period, which suggests that temperatures and total radiative forcing have increased less rapidly since the mid-90s compared to the larger rate of increase from 1960 to 1990. There are two issues that remain unresolved. The first is whether the breaks in the slope of the trend functions of temperatures and radiative forcing are common. This is important because common breaks coupled with the basic science of climate change would strongly suggest a causal effect from anthropogenic factors to temperatures. The second issue relates to establishing formally via a proper testing procedure that takes into account the noise in the series, whether there was indeed a ‘hiatus period’ for temperatures since the mid 90s. This is important because such a test would counter the widely held view that the hiatus is the product of natural internal variability. Our paper provides tests related to both issues. The results show that the breaks in temperatures and radiative forcing are common and that the hiatus is characterized by a significant decrease in their rate of growth. The statistical results are of independent interest and applicable more generally.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619301113
Journal of Econometrics,2020,Trends in distributional characteristics: Existence of global warming,María Dolores Gadea Rivas and Jesus Gonzalo,"What type of global warming exists? This study introduces a novel methodology to answer this question, which is the starting point for all issues related to climate change analyses. Global warming is defined as an increasing trend in certain distributional characteristics (moments, quantiles, etc.) of global temperatures, in addition to simply examining the average values. Temperatures are viewed as a functional stochastic process from which we obtain distributional characteristics as time series objects. Here, we present a simple robust trend test and prove that it is able to detect the existence of an unknown trend component (deterministic or stochastic) in these characteristics. Applying this trend test to daily temperatures in Central England (for the period 1772–2017) and to global cross-sectional temperatures (1880–2015), we obtain the same strong conclusions: (i) there is an increasing trend in all distributional characteristics (time series and cross-sectional), and this trend is larger in the lower quantiles than it is in the mean, median, and upper quantiles; (ii) there is a negative trend in the characteristics that measure dispersion (i.e., lower temperatures approach the median faster than higher temperatures do).

Journal of Econometrics,2020,A multicointegration model of global climate change,"Stephan B.

Surface temperature and radiative forcing cointegrate and the accumulated cointegration disequilibria represent the change in Earth system heat content, which is predominantly stored in the ocean. System heat content in turn cointegrates with surface temperature. Using a multicointegrating I(2) model, we find that the climate sensitivity is 2.8 °C and the rate of adjustment to equilibrium is realistically slow. These results contrast strongly with those from I(1) cointegration models and are more consistent with global circulation models. We also estimate Earth system heat content as a latent variable for the full period, 1850–2014, and this predicted heat content cointegrates with available ocean heat content observations for 1940–2014.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619301137

The stationary errors are allowed to be serially correlated and the regressors to be endogenous. Furthermore, the errors and regressors are allowed to be dynamically cross-sectionally correlated. The developed estimators have zero mean Gaussian mixture limiting distributions that allow for asymptotic chi-squared inference. The Wald-type hypothesis test results are the basis for considering detailed tests for general forms of group-wise poolability. We provide the corresponding group-wise pooled variants of our estimators, in case the poolability restrictions are not rejected. Our simulations indicate that appropriate pooling leads, as expected, to improved performance of the estimators and tests.

Journal of Econometrics,2020,Econometric modelling of climate systems: The equivalence of energy balance models and cointegrated vector autoregressions,Felix Pretis,"Estimates of both the human impact on climate as well as the economic impacts of climate change are crucial to inform policy decisions. Econometric modelling allows us to quantify these impacts and their uncertainties, but models have to be consistent with the underlying physics and the time series properties of the data. Here I show that energy-balance models of climate are equivalent to an econometric cointegrated system and can be estimated in discrete time. This equivalence provides a basis for the use of cointegration methods to estimate climate responses and test their feedback. Further, it is possible to use the estimated parameters to quantify uncertainties in integrated assessment models of the economic impacts of climate change. In an application I estimate a system of temperatures, ocean heat content, and radiative forcing including greenhouse gases, and find statistical support for the cointegrated energy balance model. Accounting for structural breaks from volcanic eruptions highlights large parameter uncertainties and shows that previous empirical estimates of the temperature response to increased CO2 concentrations may be misleadingly low due to model-misspecification.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407619301162

We employ a formal test for the existence of functional unit roots in the time series of these densities, and we develop a new test to distinguish functional unit roots from functional deterministic trends or explosive behavior. Results suggest that temperature anomalies contain stochastic trends (as opposed to deterministic trends or explosive roots), two trends are present in the Northern Hemisphere while one stochastic trend is present in the Southern Hemisphere, and the probabilities of observing moderately positive anomalies have increased. We postulate that differences in the pattern and number of unit roots in each hemisphere may be due to a natural experiment which causes human emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfur to be greater in the Northern Hemisphere, decreasing the mean temperature anomaly but increasing the spatial variance relative to the Southern Hemisphere.
