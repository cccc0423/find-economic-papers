Journal of Finance,2024,Presidential Address: Macrofinance and Resilience,Markus K. Brunnermeier,"This address reviews macrofinance from the perspective of resilience. It argues for a shift in mindset, away from risk management toward resilience management. It proposes a new resilience measure, and contrasts micro‐ and macro‐resilience. It also classifies macrofinance models in first‐ (log‐linearized) and second‐generation models, and links the important themes of macrofinance to resilience.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13403
Journal of Finance,2024,"Mortgage Lock‐In, Mobility, and Labor Reallocation",Julia Fonseca and Lu Liu,"We study the impact of rising mortgage rates on mobility and labor reallocation. Using individual‐level credit record data and variation in the timing of mortgage origination, we show that a 1 percentage point decline in the difference between mortgage rates locked in at origination and current rates reduces moving by 9% overall and 16% between 2022 and 2024, and this relationship is asymmetric. Mortgage lock‐in also dampens flows in and out of self‐employment and the responsiveness to shocks to nearby employment opportunities that require moving, measured as wage growth within a 50‐ to 150‐mile ring and instrumented with a shift‐share instrument.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13398
Journal of Finance,2024,Financial Sophistication and Consumer Spending,Adam Tejs Jørring,"Using detailed account‐level data, this paper explores how financial sophistication affects consumers' spending responses to changes in income. I document that, controlling for liquidity, financially unsophisticated consumers display significant spending responses to predictable decreases in their disposable income. Furthermore, they have lower savings rates, fewer liquid savings, and higher debt‐to‐income ratios, leaving them more exposed to income shocks. Robustness tests, supported by anecdotal survey evidence, indicate that these results are driven by some consumers' lack of financial sophistication and their consequent failure to understand their financial contracts, rather than by random idiosyncratic shocks, rational liquidity management, or optimal inattention.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13393
Journal of Finance,2024,"Time‐Consistent Individuals, Time‐Inconsistent Households",Andrew Hertzberg,"I present a model of consumption and savings for a multiperson household in which members are imperfectly altruistic, derive utility from both private and shared public goods, and share wealth. I show that, despite having standard exponential time preferences, the household is time‐inconsistent: Members save too little and overspend on private consumption goods. The household remains time‐inconsistent even when members save separately, because the possibility of voluntary transfers or joint contribution to the public good preserves the dynamic commons problem. The household will choose to share wealth when the risk‐sharing benefits outweigh the utility cost of overconsumption.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13392
Journal of Finance,2024,A Multifactor Perspective on Volatility‐Managed Portfolios,"DeMIGUEL Victor, Alberto Martín‐utrera and Raman Uppal","Moreira and Muir question the existence of a strong risk‐return trade‐off by showing that investors can improve performance by reducing exposure to risk factors when their volatility is high. However, Cederburg et al. show that these strategies fail out‐of‐sample, and Barroso and Detzel show they do not survive transaction costs. We propose a conditional multifactor portfolio that outperforms its unconditional counterpart even out‐of‐sample and net of costs. Moreover, we show that factor risk prices generally decrease with market volatility. Our results demonstrate that the breakdown of the risk‐return trade‐off is more puzzling than previously thought.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13395
Journal of Finance,2024,Bonds versus Equities: Information for Investment,"Huifeng Chang, Adrien D'Avernas and Andrea L. Eisfeldt","We provide a simple model of investment by a firm funded with debt and equity and empirical evidence to demonstrate that, once we control for the debt overhang problem with credit spreads, asset volatility is an unambiguously positive signal for investment, while equity volatility sends a mixed signal: Elevated volatility raises the option value of equity and increases investment for financially sound firms, but exacerbates debt overhang and decreases investment for firms close to default. Our study provides a simple unified understanding of the structural and empirical relationships between investment, credit spreads, equity versus asset volatility, leverage, and Tobin's q$q$.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13396
Journal of Finance,2024,Putting the Price in Asset Pricing,Thummim Cho and Christopher Polk,"We propose a novel way to estimate a portfolio's abnormal price, the percentage gap between price and the present value of dividends computed with a chosen asset pricing model. Our method, based on a novel identity, resembles the time‐series estimator of abnormal returns, avoids the issues in alternative approaches, and clarifies the role of risk and mispricing in long‐horizon returns. We apply our techniques to study the cross‐section of price levels relative to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and find that a single characteristic, adjusted value, provides a parsimonious model of CAPM‐implied abnormal price.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13391
Journal of Finance,2024,Liquidity Transformation and Fragility in the U.S. Banking Sector,"Qi Chen, Itay Goldstein, Zeqiong Huang and Rahul Vashishtha","Liquidity transformation, a key role of banks, is thought to increase fragility, as uninsured depositors face an incentive to withdraw money before others (a so‐called panic run). Despite much theoretical work, however, there is little empirical evidence establishing this mechanism. In this paper, we provide the first large‐scale evidence of this mechanism. Banks that engage in more liquidity transformation exhibit higher fragility, as captured by stronger sensitivities of uninsured deposit flows to bank performance and greater levels of uninsured deposit outflows when performance is poor. We also explore the effects of deposit insurance and systemic risk.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13390
Journal of Finance,2024,Currency Management by International Fixed‐Income Mutual Funds,Clemens Sialm and Qifei Zhu,"Investments in international fixed‐income securities are exposed to significant currency risks. We collect novel data on currency derivatives used by U.S. international fixed‐income funds. We document that while 90% of funds use currency forwards, they hedge, on average, only 18% of their currency exposure. Funds' currency forward positions differ substantially based on risk management demands related to portfolio currency exposure, return‐enhancement motives such as currency momentum and carry trade, and strategic considerations related to past performance and fund clientele. Funds that hedge their currency risk exhibit lower return variability, but do not generate inferior abnormal returns.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13381
Journal of Finance,2024,Treasury Bill Shortages and the Pricing of Short‐Term Assets,Adrien D'Avernas and Quentin Vandeweyer,"We propose a model of post‐Great Financial Crisis (GFC) money markets and monetary policy implementation. In our framework, capital regulation may deter banks from intermediating liquidity derived from holding reserves to shadow banks. Consequently, money markets can be segmented, and the scarcity of Treasury bills available to shadow banks is the main driver of short‐term spreads. In this regime, open market operations have an inverse effect on net liquidity provision when swapping ample reserves for scarce T‐bills or repos. Our model quantitatively accounts for post‐2010 time series for repo rates, T‐bill yields, and the Fed's reverse repo facility usage.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13376
Journal of Finance,2024,Equity Term Structures without Dividend Strips Data,"Stefano Giglio, Bryan Kelly and Serhiy Kozak","We use a large cross section of equity returns to estimate a rich affine model of equity prices, dividends, returns, and their dynamics. Our model prices dividend strips of the market and equity portfolios without using strips data in the estimation. Yet model‐implied equity yields closely match yields on traded strips. Our model extends equity term‐structure data over time (to the 1970s) and across maturities, and generates term structures for various equity portfolios. The novel cross section of term structures from our model covers 45 years and includes several recessions, providing a novel set of empirical moments to discipline asset pricing models.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13394
Journal of Finance,2024,Utility Tokens as a Commitment to Competition,"Itay Goldstein, Deeksha Gupta and Ruslan Sverchkov","We show that utility tokens can limit the rent‐seeking activities of two‐sided platforms with market power while preserving efficiency gains due to network effects. We model platforms where buyers and sellers can meet to exchange services. Tokens serve as the sole medium of exchange on a platform and can be traded in a secondary market. Tokenizing a platform commits a firm to give up monopolistic rents associated with the control of the platform, leading to long‐run competitive prices. We show how the threat of entrants can incentivize developers to tokenize and discuss cases where regulation is needed to enforce tokenization.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13389
Journal of Finance,2024,The Working Capital Credit Multiplier,"Heitor Almeida, Daniel Carvalho and Taehyun Kim","We provide novel evidence that funding frictions can limit firms’ short‐term investments in receivables and inventories, reducing their production capacity. We propose a credit multiplier driven by these considerations and empirically isolate its importance by comparing how a similar firm responds to shocks differently when these shocks are initiated in their most profitable quarter (“main quarter”). We implement this test using recurring and unpredictable shocks (e.g., oil shocks) and provide extensive evidence supporting our identification strategy. Our results suggest that funding constraints and credit multiplier effects are significant for smaller firms that heavily rely on financing from suppliers.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13385
Journal of Finance,2024,Lying to Speak the Truth: Selective Manipulation and Improved Information Transmission,Paul Povel and Günter Strobl,"We analyze a principal‐agent model in which an effort‐averse agent can manipulate a publicly observable performance report. The principal cannot observe the agent's cost of effort, her effort choice, and whether she manipulated the report. An optimal contract links compensation to the realized output and the (possibly manipulated) report. Manipulation can be beneficial to the principal because it can make the report more informative about the agent's effort choice, thereby reducing the agent's information rent. This is achieved through a contract that incentivizes the agent to selectively engage in manipulation based on her effort choice.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13375
Journal of Finance,2024,A (Sub)penny for Your Thoughts: Tracking Retail Investor Activity in TAQ,"Brad Barber, Xing Huang, Philippe Jorion, Terrance Odean and Christopher Schwarz","We placed 85,000 retail trades in six retail brokerage accounts from December 2021 to June 2022 to validate the Boehmer et al. algorithm, which uses subpenny trade prices to identify and sign retail trades. The algorithm identifies 35% of our trades as retail, incorrectly signs 28% of identified trades, and yields uninformative order imbalance measures for 30% of stocks. We modify the algorithm by signing trades using the quoted spread midpoints. The quote midpoint method does not affect identification rates but reduces the signing error rates to 5% and provides informative order imbalance measures for all stocks.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13334
Journal of Finance,2024,Spending Less after (Seemingly) Bad News,"Mark J. Garmaise, Yaron Levi and Hanno Lustig","Using high‐frequency spending data, we show that household consumption displays excess sensitivity to salient macroeconomic news, even when the news is not real. When the announced local unemployment rate reaches a 12‐month maximum, local news coverage of unemployment increases and local consumers reduce their discretionary spending by 1.5% relative to consumers in areas with the same macroeconomic conditions. Low‐income households display greater excess sensitivity to salience. The decrease in spending is not later reversed. Households in treated areas act as if they are more financially constrained than those in untreated areas with the same fundamentals.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13325
Journal of Finance,2024,Insensitive Investors,"Constantin Charles, Cary Frydman and Mete Kilic","We experimentally study the transmission of subjective expectations into actions. Subjects in our experiment report valuations that are far too insensitive to their expectations, relative to the prediction from a frictionless model. We propose that the insensitivity is driven by a noisy cognitive process that prevents subjects from precisely computing asset valuations. The empirical link between subjective expectations and actions becomes stronger as subjective expectations approach rational expectations. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating weak transmission into belief‐based asset pricing models. Finally, we discuss how cognitive noise can provide a microfoundation for inelastic demand in the stock market.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13362
Journal of Finance,2024,Money and Banking with Reserves and CBDC,Dirk Niepelt,"We analyze the role of retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) and reserves when banks exert deposit market power and liquidity transformation entails externalities. Optimal monetary architecture minimizes the social costs of liquidity provision, and optimal monetary policy follows modified Friedman rules. Interest rates on reserves and CBDC should differ. Calibrations robustly suggest that CBDC provides liquidity more efficiently than deposits unless the central bank must refinance banks and this is very costly. Accordingly, the optimal share of CBDC in payments tends to exceed that of deposits.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13357
Journal of Finance,2024,The Time‐Varying Price of Financial Intermediation in the Mortgage Market,"Andreas Fuster, Stephanie H. Lo and Paul Willen","We introduce a new measure of the price charged by financial intermediaries for connecting mortgage borrowers with capital market investors. Based on administrative lender pricing data, we document that the price of intermediation reacts strongly to variation in demand, reflecting capacity constraints of mortgage originators. This positive comovement of price with quantity reduced the pass‐through of quantitative easing. We also find a notable upward trend in this price between 2008 and 2014, likely due to increased legal and regulatory burden in the mortgage market. The trend led to an implicit cost to borrowers of nearly $100 billion over this period.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13358
Journal of Finance,2024,What Drives Variation in the U.S. Debt‐to‐Output Ratio? The Dogs that Did not Bark,"Zhengyang Jiang, Hanno Lustig, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh and Mindy Z. Xiaolan","A higher U.S. government debt‐to‐output (D‐O) ratio does not forecast higher surpluses or lower returns on Treasurys in the future. Neither future cash flows nor discount rates account for the variation in the current D‐O ratio. The market valuation of Treasurys is surprisingly insensitive to macro fundamentals. Instead, the future D‐O ratio accounts for most of the variation because the D‐O ratio is highly persistent. Systematic surplus forecast errors may help account for these findings. Since the start of the Global Financial Crisis, surplus projections have anticipated a large fiscal correction that failed to materialize.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13363
Journal of Finance,2024,Inside and Outside Information,Daniel Quigley and Ansgar Walther,"We study an economy with financial frictions in which a regulator designs a test that reveals outside information about a firm's quality to investors. The firm can also disclose verifiable inside information about its quality. We show that the regulator optimally aims for “public speech and private silence,” which is achieved with tests that give insiders an incentive to stay quiet. We fully characterize optimal tests by developing tools for Bayesian persuasion with incentive constraints, and use these results to derive novel guidance for the design of bank stress tests, as well as benchmarks for socially optimal corporate credit ratings.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13360
Journal of Finance,2024,Information Aggregation with Asymmetric Asset Payoffs,"Elias Albagli, Christian Hellwig and Aleh Tsyvinski","We study noisy aggregation of dispersed information in financial markets without imposing parametric restrictions on preferences, information, and return distributions. We provide a general characterization of asset returns by means of a risk‐neutral probability measure that features excess weight on tail risks. Moreover, we link excess weight on tail risks to observable moments such as forecast dispersion and accuracy, and argue that it provides a unified explanation for several prominent cross‐sectional return anomalies. Simple calibrations suggest the model can account for a significant fraction of empirical returns to skewness, returns to disagreement, and interaction effects between the two.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13361
Journal of Finance,2024,Half Banked: The Economic Impact of Cash Management in the Marijuana Industry,Elizabeth A. Berger and Nathan Seegert,"We investigate the economic value of cash management. In the legal marijuana industry, where only half of businesses have access to cash management services from a financial institution, we examine dispensary profitability using administrative and survey data. Our results show that businesses with cash management charge higher retail prices (8.3%), pay lower wholesale prices (7.3%), and have higher sales volume (19%). Together, these advantages create a 40% increase in profitability. These results support our model in which reputational capital and administrative costs drive profitability regardless of whether national banks, credit unions, or fintech provide the cash management functions.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13364
Journal of Finance,2024,Treasury Richness,Matthias Fleckenstein and Francis A. Longstaff,"We provide estimates of Treasury convenience premia across the entire term structure of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds over more than a quarter of a century and document a variety of key stylized facts about their time‐series and cross‐sectional patterns. These results raise concerns about the evolving nature of Treasury markets and suggest that investors may now place less weight on the traditional role of Treasury securities as liquid trading vehicles. These stylized facts provide empirical benchmarks that could help guide future theoretical and empirical work about the economics of safe assets in financial markets.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13371
Journal of Finance,2024,Meeting Targets in Competitive Product Markets,Emilio Bisetti and Stephen A. Karolyi,"We show that public banks face negative stock return jumps after missing their earnings per share (EPS) targets, and theoretically and quantitatively link these jumps to bunching behavior in the EPS surprise distribution. Bunching banks cut deposit rates to meet their targets, but do so at the expense of deposit outflows and franchise value losses. Local competitors, including private banks unexposed to capital market pressure, increase deposit rates, compensating depositors for switching. Our results provide new evidence that performance targeting incentives can affect consumer product prices, and suggest that competition may provide a check on public firms' targeting efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13369
Journal of Finance,2024,Is Long‐Run Risk Really Priced? Revisiting Liu and Matthies (2022),Paulo Maio,"The claim by Liu and Matthies (LM) that their macro news risk factor (NI) prices 51 portfolios (associated with four different portfolio groups) is not appropriate. In fact, their single‐factor model is successful only in explaining the momentum deciles, while producing strongly negative performance for the remaining groups. The pricing performance is more doubtful in the case of the alternative news factor (HNI), as the respective risk price is not identified. LM's conclusions stem from a combination of questionable empirical choices and misinterpretation of their results. Moreover, the NI model cannot explain prominent capital asset pricing model anomalies not considered in their study.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13340
Journal of Finance,2024,Monetary Policy and Asset Price Overshooting: A Rationale for the Wall/Main Street Disconnect,Ricardo Caballero and Alp Simsek,"We analyze optimal monetary policy and its implications for asset prices when aggregate demand has inertia. If there is a negative output gap, the central bank optimally overshoots aggregate asset prices (above their steady‐state levels consistent with current potential output). Overshooting leads to a temporary disconnect between the performance of financial markets and the real economy, but accelerates the recovery. When there is a lower bound constraint on the discount rate, good macroeconomic news is better news for asset prices when the output gap is more negative. Finally, we document that during the COVID‐19 recovery, the policy‐induced overshooting was large.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13343
Journal of Finance,2024,Countercyclical Income Risk and Portfolio Choices: Evidence from Sweden,"Sylvain Catherine, Paolo Sodini and Yapei Zhang","Using Swedish administrative panel data, we document that workers facing higher left‐tail income risk when equity markets perform poorly have lower portfolio equity share. In line with theory, the relationship between cyclical skewness and stock holdings increases with the share of human capital in a worker's total wealth and vanishes as workers get closer to retirement. Cyclical skewness also predicts portfolio differences within pairs of identical twins. Our findings show that households hedge against correlated tail risks, an important mechanism in asset pricing and portfolio choice models.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13341
Journal of Finance,2024,Tracing the International Transmission of a Crisis through Multinational Firms,Marcus Biermann and Kilian Huber,"We show that multinational firms transmit shocks across countries through their internal capital markets. We study a credit supply shock to parent firms in Germany. International affiliates outside Germany supported their parents through internal lending, became financially constrained themselves, and experienced lower real growth. We find that managers were “Darwinist” with respect to international affiliates but “Socialist” in the home country, that internal capital markets transmitted the credit shock more strongly than a nonfinancial shock, and that access to developed credit markets attenuated the real effects. The total real impact of shock transmission through multinationals on foreign economies was large.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13338
Journal of Finance,2024,A Horizon‐Based Decomposition of Mutual Fund Value Added Using Transactions,"Jules van Binsbergen, Jungsuk Han, Hongxun Ruan and Ran Xing","We decompose mutual fund value added by the length of funds' holdings using transaction‐level data. We motivate our decomposition with a model featuring horizon‐specific investment ideas, where short‐term ideas are less scalable because the associated trades cannot be spread over time. Fund turnover correlates negatively with the horizon over which value is added and positively with price impact costs. As predicted, holdings of high‐turnover funds add a substantial amount of value in the first two weeks, of which more than 80% is earned on Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and earnings announcement days. Holdings of low‐turnover funds add value only over longer horizons.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13331
Journal of Finance,2024,Zombie Credit and (Dis‐)Inflation: Evidence from Europe,"Viral V. Acharya, Matteo Crosignani, Tim Eisert and Christian Eufinger","We show that “zombie credit”—subsidized credit to nonviable firms—has a disinflationary effect. By keeping these firms afloat, zombie credit creates excess aggregate supply, thereby putting downward pressure on prices. Granular European data on inflation, firms, and banks confirm this mechanism. Markets affected by a rise in zombie credit experience lower firm entry and exit, capacity utilization, markups, and inflation, as well as a misallocation of capital and labor, which results in lower productivity, investment, and value added. If weakly capitalized banks were recapitalized in 2009, inflation in Europe would have been up to 0.21 percentage points higher post‐2012.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13342
Journal of Finance,2024,Goal Setting and Saving in the FinTech Era,Antonio Gargano and Alberto G. Rossi,"We study the effectiveness of saving goals in increasing individuals' savings using data from a Fintech app. Using a difference‐in‐differences identification strategy that randomly assigns users into a group of beta testers who can set goals and a group of users who cannot, we find that setting goals increases individuals' savings rate. The increased savings within the app do not reduce savings outside the app. Moreover, goal setting helps those individuals previously identified as having the lowest propensity to save. Matching App user survey responses to their behavior highlights the relative merits of monitoring and concreteness channels in explaining our findings.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13339
Journal of Finance,2024,Rent or Buy? Inflation Experiences and Homeownership within and across Countries,Ulrike Malmendier and Alexandra Steiny Wellsjo,"We show that past inflation experiences strongly predict homeownership within and across countries. First, we collect novel survey data, which reveal inflation protection to be a key motivation for homeownership, especially after high inflation experiences. Second, using household data from 22 European countries, we find that higher exposure to historical inflation predicts higher homeownership rates. We estimate similar associations among immigrants to the United States who experienced different past inflation in their home countries but face the same U.S. housing market. Consistent with the experience effects model, the relationship is strongest in countries with predominantly fixed‐rate mortgages.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13332
Journal of Finance,2024,A Portfolio Approach to Global Imbalances,"Zhengyang Jiang, Robert J. Richmond and Tony Zhang","We use a portfolio‐based framework to understand what drives the decline of the U.S. net foreign asset (NFA) position and the reversal in returns earned on the U.S. NFA (exorbitant privilege). We show that global savings gluts and monetary policies widened the U.S. NFA position, while investor demand shifts partially offset this widening. Moreover, U.S. privilege declined after 2010, in line with increasing foreign demand for U.S. equity. We also highlight a quantity dimension of the U.S. privilege: The U.S. can issue substantially more debt than other countries for a given yield increase.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13333
Journal of Finance,2024,The Term Structure of Covered Interest Rate Parity Violations,"Patrick Augustin, Mikhail Chernov, Lukas Schmid and Dongho Song","We quantify the impact of risk‐based and nonrisk‐based intermediary constraints (IC) on the term structure of covered interest rate parity (CIP) violations. Using a stochastic discount factor (SDF) inferred from interest rate swaps, we value currency derivatives. The wedge between model‐implied and observed derivative prices reflects the impact of nonrisk‐based IC because our SDF incorporates risk‐based IC. There is no wedge at short horizons, while the wedge accounts for 40% of long‐term CIP violations. Consistent with IC theory, the wedge correlates with the shadow cost of intermediary capital, and the SDF‐implied interest rate is a weighted average of collateralized and uncollateralized interest rates.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13336
Journal of Finance,2024,Due Diligence,"Brendan Daley, Thomas Geelen and Brett Green","We propose a model of due diligence and analyze its effect on prices, payoffs, and deal completion. In our model, if the seller accepts an offer, the winning bidder (or “acquirer”) can gather information and chooses when to complete the transaction. In equilibrium, the acquirer engages in “too much” due diligence. Our quantitative results suggest that the magnitude of the distortion is economically significant. Nevertheless, allowing for due diligence can improve both total surplus and the seller's payoff compared to a setting without due diligence. We use our framework to explore the timing of due diligence, bidder heterogeneity, and breakup fees.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13322
Journal of Finance,2024,Broadband Internet and the Stock Market Investments of Individual Investors,"Hans K. Hvide, Tom G. Meling, Magne Mogstad and Ola Vestad","We study the effects of broadband internet use on the investment decisions of individual investors. A public program in Norway provides plausibly exogenous variation in internet use. Our instrumental variables estimates show that internet use causes a substantial increase in stock market participation, driven primarily by increased fund ownership. Existing investors tilt their portfolios toward funds, thereby obtaining more diversified portfolios and higher Sharpe ratios, and do not increase their trading activity in stocks. Overall, access to high‐speed internet spurs a “democratization of finance,” with individuals making investment decisions that are more in line with the advice from portfolio theory.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13335
Journal of Finance,2024,"Mergers, Product Prices, and Innovation: Evidence from the Pharmaceutical Industry",Alice Bonaimé and Ye (emma) Wang,"Using novel data from the pharmaceutical industry, we study product prices and innovation around mergers. Exploiting within‐deal variation in product market consolidation, we show that prices increase more for drugs in consolidating markets than for matched control drugs. Estimates indicate a 2% average price effect that persists for about one year. Price increases expand with acquirer‐target product similarity and are more pronounced within less competitive product markets with fewer players and no generic competition. Examination of trade‐offs reveals these deals generate significant shareholder value. They also spur labeling and other manufacturing‐related innovation, but not the development of new drugs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13321
Journal of Finance,2024,Does Alternative Data Improve Financial Forecasting? The Horizon Effect,"Olivier Dessaint, Thierry Foucault and Laurent Fresard","Existing research suggests that alternative data are mainly informative about short‐term future outcomes. We show theoretically that the availability of short‐term‐oriented data can induce forecasters to optimally shift their attention from the long term to the short term because it reduces the cost of obtaining short‐term information. Consequently, the informativeness of their long‐term forecasts decreases, even though the informativeness of their short‐term forecasts increases. We test and confirm this prediction by considering how the informativeness of equity analysts' forecasts at various horizons varies over the long run and with their exposure to social media data.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13323
Journal of Finance,2024,Modeling Conditional Factor Risk Premia Implied by Index Option Returns,"Mathieu Fournier, Kris Jacobs and Piotr Orłowski","We propose a novel factor model for option returns. Option exposures are estimated nonparametrically, and factor risk premia can vary nonlinearly with states. The model is estimated using regressions with minimal assumptions on factor and option return dynamics. We estimate the model using index options to characterize the conditional risk premia for factors of interest, such as the market return, market variance, tail and intermediary risk factors, higher moments, and the VIX term structure slope. Together, market return and variance explain more than 90% of option return variation. Unconditionally, the magnitude of the variance risk premium is plausible. It displays pronounced time variation, spikes during crises, and always has the expected sign.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13324

Journal of Finance,2024,Political Polarization Affects Households' Financial Decisions: Evidence from Home Sales,"W. Ben McCartney, John Orellana‐li and Calvin Zhang","Political identity and partisanship are salient features of today's society. Using deeds records and voter rolls, we show that current residents are more likely to sell their homes when opposite‐party neighbors move in nearby than when unaffiliated or same‐party neighbors do. This is especially true when the new neighbors are politically active, consistent with an animosity between parties mechanism. We conclude that affective polarization is not limited to purely political settings and affects one of the household's most important financial decisions, their home transactions.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13315
Journal of Finance,2024,Measuring “Dark Matter” in Asset Pricing Models,"Hui Chen, Winston Dou and Leonid Kogan","We formalize the concept of “dark matter” in asset pricing models by quantifying the additional informativeness of cross‐equation restrictions about fundamental dynamics. The dark‐matter measure captures the degree of fragility for models that are potentially misspecified and unstable: a large dark‐matter measure indicates that the model lacks internal refutability (weak power of optimal specification tests) and external validity (high overfitting tendency and poor out‐of‐sample fit). The measure can be computed at low cost even for complex dynamic structural models. To illustrate its applications, we provide quantitative examples applying the measure to (time‐varying) rare‐disaster risk and long‐run risk models.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13317
Journal of Finance,2024,Informed Trading Intensity,"Vincent Bogousslavsky, Vyacheslav Fos and Dmitriy Muravyev","We train a machine learning method on a class of informed trades to develop a new measure of informed trading, informed trading intensity (ITI). ITI increases before earnings, mergers and acquisitions, and news announcements, and has implications for return reversal and asset pricing. ITI is effective because it captures nonlinearities and interactions between informed trading, volume, and volatility. This data‐driven approach can shed light on the economics of informed trading, including impatient informed trading, commonality in informed trading, and models of informed trading. Overall, learning from informed trading data can generate an effective informed trading measure.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13320
Journal of Finance,2024,How Integrated are Credit and Equity Markets? Evidence from Index Options,"Pierre Collin‐dufresne, Benjamin Junge and Anders B.

We derive analytical expressions for CDX and SPX options within a structural credit‐risk model with stochastic volatility and jumps using new results for pricing compound options via multivariate affine transform analysis. The model captures many aspects of the joint dynamics of CDX and SPX options. However, it cannot reconcile the relative levels of option prices, suggesting that credit and equity markets are not fully integrated. A strategy of selling CDX volatility yields significantly higher excess returns than selling SPX volatility.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13300
Journal of Finance,2024,Dissecting the Long‐Term Performance of the Chinese Stock Market,"Franklin Allen, Jun (qj) Qian, Chenyu Shan and Julie Lei Zhu","Domestically listed Chinese (A‐share) firms have lower stock returns than externally listed Chinese, developed, and emerging country firms during 2000 to 2018. They also have lower net cash flows than matched unlisted Chinese firms. The underperformance of both stock and accounting returns is more pronounced for large A‐share firms, while small firms show no underperformance along either dimension. Investor sentiment explains low stock returns in the cross‐country and within‐A‐share samples. Institutional deficiencies in listing and delisting processes and weak corporate governance in terms of shareholder value creation are consistent with the underperformance in stock returns and net cash flows.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13312
Journal of Finance,2024,The Narrow Channel of Quantitative Easing: Evidence from YCC Down Under,David O. Lucca and Jonathan Wright,"We study the recent Australian experience with yield curve control (YCC) as perhaps the best evidence of how this policy might work in other developed economies. YCC seemingly worked well in 2020, when the market expected short rates to stay at zero for a long period of time. As the global recovery and inflation gained momentum in 2021, liftoff expectations moved up, the Reserve Bank of Australia purchased most of the targeted government bond outstanding, and the target bond's yield dislocated from other financial market instruments. The evidence suggests that central bank bond purchase programs can operate more narrowly than previously considered.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13307
Journal of Finance,2024,Overconfidence and Preferences for Competition,"Ernesto Reuben, Paola Sapienza and Luigi Zingales","We study when preferences for competition are a positive economic trait among high earners and the extent to which this trait can explain the gender gap in income among a master's degree in business administration (MBAs). Consistent with the experimental evidence, preferences for competition are a positive economic trait only for individuals who are not overconfident. Preferences for competition correlate with income only at graduation when bonuses are guaranteed and not a function of performance. Overconfident competition‐loving MBAs observe lower compensation and income growth, and experience greater exit from high‐reward industries and more frequent job interruptions. Preferences for competition do not explain the gender pay gap among MBAs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13314
Journal of Finance,2024,Disclosing a Random Walk,"Ilan Kremer, Amnon Schreiber and Andrzej Skrzypacz","We examine a dynamic disclosure model in which the value of a firm follows a random walk. Every period, with some probability, the manager learns the firm's value and decides whether to disclose it. The manager maximizes the market perception of the firm's value, which is based on disclosed information. In equilibrium, the manager follows a threshold strategy with thresholds below current prices. He sometimes reveals pessimistic information that reduces the market perception of the firm's value. He does so to reduce future market uncertainty, which is valuable even under risk‐neutrality.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13290

Our analysis formalizes the following insights: (i) Within‐firm resource allocation is based not only on divisions' productivity, as in winner‐picking models, but also their risk; (ii) firms may voluntarily spin off productive divisions to increase liquidity; (iii) diversification can reduce firm value in low‐liquidity states, as it increases the spinoff cost and hampers liquidity management; (iv) corporate socialism makes liquidity less valuable; and (v) division investment is determined by the ratio between marginal q$q$ and marginal value of cash.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13318
Journal of Finance,2024,Fee Variation in Private Equity,Juliane Begenau and Emil N. Siriwardane,"We study how investment fees vary within private equity funds. Net‐of‐fee return clustering suggests that most funds have two tiers of fees, and we decompose differences across tiers into both management‐ and performance‐based fees. Managers of venture capital funds and those in high demand are less likely to use multiple fee schedules. Some investors consistently pay lower fees relative to others within their funds. Investor size, experience, and past performance explain some but not all of this effect, suggesting that unobserved traits like negotiation skill or bargaining power materially impact the fees that investors pay to access private markets.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13319

In the three years following a $0.88 minimum wage increase, low‐wage workers experience a $2,712 income increase and a $856 decrease in debt. The entire decline in debt comes from less student loan borrowing among enrolled college students. Credit constraints, buffer‐stock behavior, and other rational channels cannot explain the reduction in student debt. Our results are consistent with students perceiving a utility cost of borrowing student debt arising from mental accounting.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13297
Journal of Finance,2024,The Equilibrium Size and Value‐Added of Venture Capital,Francesco Sannino,"I model positive sorting of entrepreneurs across the high and low value‐added segments of the venture capital market. Aiming to attract high‐quality entrepreneurs, inefficiently many venture capitalists (VCs) commit to provide high value‐added by forming small portfolios. This draws the marginal entrepreneur away from the low value‐added segment, reducing match quality in the high value‐added segment too. There is underinvestment. Multiple equilibria may emerge, and they differ in aggregate investment. The model rationalizes evidence on VC returns and value‐added along fundraising “waves” and when the cost of entrepreneurship falls, and generates untested predictions on the size and value‐added of venture capital.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13313
Journal of Finance,2024,Auctions with Endogenous Initiation,Alexander S. Gorbenko and Andrey Malenko,"We study initiation of takeover auctions by potential buyers and the seller. A bidder's indication of interest reveals that she is optimistic about the target. If bidders' values have a substantial common component, as in takeover battles between financial bidders, this effect disincentivizes bidders from indicating interest, and auctions are seller‐initiated. Conversely, in private‐value auctions, such as battles between strategic bidders, equilibria can feature both seller‐ and bidder‐initiated auctions, with the likelihood of the latter decreasing in commonality of values and the probability of a forced sale by the seller. We also relate initiation to bids and auction outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13288
Journal of Finance,2024,The Dark Side of Circuit Breakers,"Hui Chen, Anton Petukhov, Jiang Wang and Hao Xing","Market‐wide circuit breakers are trading halts aimed at stabilizing the market during dramatic price declines. Using an intertemporal equilibrium model, we show that a circuit breaker significantly alters market dynamics and affects investor welfare. As the market approaches the circuit breaker, price volatility rises drastically, accelerating the chance of triggering the circuit breaker—the so‐called “magnet effect,” returns exhibit increasing negative skewness, and trading activity spikes up. Our empirical analysis supports the model's predictions. Circuit breakers can affect overall welfare negatively or positively, depending on the relative significance of investors' trading motives for risk sharing versus irrational speculation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13310

We document these findings in the context of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), where private lenders faced no credit risk but decided which firms to serve. Black‐owned firms obtained PPP loans primarily from automated fintech lenders, especially in areas with high racial animus. After traditional banks automated their loan processing procedures, their PPP lending to Black‐owned firms increased. Our findings cannot be fully explained by racial differences in loan application behaviors, preexisting banking relationships, firm performance, or fraud rates.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13303
Journal of Finance,2024,Disclosing to Informed Traders,"Snehal Banerjee, Iván Marinovic and Kevin Smith","We develop a model in which a firm's manager can voluntarily disclose to privately informed investors. In equilibrium, the manager only discloses sufficiently favorable news. If the manager is known to be informed but disclosure is costly, the probability of disclosure increases with market liquidity and the stock trades at a discount relative to expected cash flows. However, when investors are uncertain about whether the manager is informed, disclosure can decrease with market liquidity and the stock can trade at a premium relative to expected cash flows. Moreover, contrary to common intuition, public information can crowd in more voluntary disclosure.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13296
Journal of Finance,2024,Leverage Is a Double‐Edged Sword,"Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, Ke Tang, Jingyuan Wang and Xuewei Yang","We use proprietary data on intraday transactions at a futures brokerage to analyze how implied leverage influences trading performance. Across all investors, leverage is negatively related to performance, due partly to increased trading costs and partly to forced liquidations resulting from margin calls. Defining skill out‐of‐sample, we find that relative performance differentials across unskilled and skilled investors persist. Unskilled investors' leverage amplifies losses from lottery preferences and the disposition effect. Leverage stimulates liquidity provision by skilled investors, and enhances returns. Although regulatory increases in required margins decrease skilled investors' returns, they enhance overall returns, and attenuate return volatility.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13316
Journal of Finance,2024,Choosing to Disagree: Endogenous Dismissiveness and Overconfidence in Financial Markets,"Snehal Banerjee, Jesse Davis and Naveen Gondhi","The psychology literature documents that individuals derive current utility from their beliefs about future events. We show that, as a result, investors in financial markets choose to disagree about both private information and price information. When objective price informativeness is low, each investor dismisses the private signals of others and ignores price information. In contrast, when prices are sufficiently informative, heterogeneous interpretations arise endogenously: most investors ignore prices, while the rest condition on it. Our analysis demonstrates how observed deviations from rational expectations (e.g., dismissiveness, overconfidence) arise endogenously, interact with each other, and vary with economic conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13311

Journal of Finance,2024,The Decline of Secured Debt,"Efraim Benmelech, Nitish Kumar and Raghuram Rajan","The share of secured debt issued (as a fraction of total corporate debt) declined steadily in the United States over the twentieth century. This stems partly from financial development giving creditors greater confidence that high‐quality borrowers will respect their claims even if creditors do not obtain security upfront. Consequently, such borrowers prefer retaining financial flexibility by not giving security up front. Instead, security is given contingently—when a firm approaches distress. This also explains why, superimposed on the secular decline, the share of secured debt issued is countercyclical.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13308

Insurance companies, especially life insurers and insurers with low regulatory capital ratios, are more exposed to textual risks. Consistent with issuers hedging litigation risks with disclosure, we find that textual contents are associated with second‐lien underreporting and preissuance written communications.

Journal of Finance,2024,Interest Rate Skewness and Biased Beliefs,Michael Bauer and Mikhail Chernov,"Conditional skewness of Treasury yields is an important indicator of the risks to the macroeconomic outlook. Positive skewness signals upside risk to interest rates during periods of accommodative monetary policy and an upward‐sloping yield curve, and vice versa. Skewness has substantial predictive power for future bond excess returns, high‐frequency interest rate changes around Federal Open Market Committee announcements, and survey forecast errors for interest rates. The estimated expectational errors, or biases in beliefs, are quantitatively important for statistical bond risk premia. These findings are consistent with a heterogeneous‐beliefs model in which one of the agents is wrong about consumption growth.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13276

In the context of ride share, difference‐in‐difference analysis reveals increased vehicle purchases, borrowing, utilization, and employment around entry, but financially constrained individuals cannot participate. To assess the equilibrium importance of financing, I build and estimate a structural model of the gig economy. Access to finance proves critical for the gig economy's growth: without finance, equilibrium quantities would be 40% lower and prices 90% higher, and only higher‐income households could participate as drivers.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13292

Trading and voting are complementary, which gives rise to self‐fulfilling expectations about proposal acceptance and multiple equilibria. Prices and shareholder welfare can move in opposite directions, so the former may be an invalid proxy for the latter. Relaxing trading frictions can reduce welfare because it allows extreme shareholders to gain more weight in voting. Delegating decision‐making to the board can help overcome collective action problems at the voting stage.

We address this question with hand‐collected data from 530 SEC (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) investigations. Using two plausibly exogenous shocks to expected penalties, we show that insiders trade less aggressively and earlier and concentrate on tips of greater value when facing a higher risk. The results match the predictions of a model where an insider internalizes the impact of trades on prices and the likelihood of prosecution and anticipates penalties in proportion to trade profits.

Early supporters effectively delegate their decisions to a “gatekeeper,” resulting in unidirectional cascades without herding on rejections. Project proposers can consequently charge higher prices.
