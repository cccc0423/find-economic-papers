AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,"Child Care Subsidies, Quality, and Optimal Income Taxation","Spencer Bastani, Sören Blomquist and Luca Micheletto","We study child care subsidies in a Mirrleesian optimal tax framework where parents choose both the quantity and quality of child care. Child care services not only enable parents to work, but also contribute to children's human capital. We examine the conditions under which child care expenditures should be encouraged or discouraged by the tax system under different assumptions regarding the available policy instruments. Using a quantitative model calibrated to the US economy, we illustrate the possibility that child care expenditures should be taxed rather than subsidized, and we discuss the merits of public provision schemes for child care.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170648
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,How Taxing Is Tax Filing? Using Revealed Preferences to Estimate Compliance Costs,Youssef Benzarti,"This paper uses a quasi-experimental design to estimate the cost of filing taxes. Using US tax returns, I observe how taxpayers choose between itemizing deductions and claiming the standard deduction. Taxpayers forgo large tax savings to avoid compliance costs, which provides a revealed preference estimate of such costs. I show that costs increase with income, consistent with an opportunity cost of time explanation. These estimates suggest substantial costs of filing federal income taxes, significantly larger than previously estimated using surveys.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180664
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Hidden Baggage: Behavioral Responses to Changes in Airline Ticket Tax Disclosure,Sebastien Bradley and Naomi Feldman,"We examine the impact of a January 2012 enforcement action by the US Department of Transportation that required US air carriers and online travel agents to modify their web interfaces to incorporate all ticket taxes in up-front, advertised fares. We show that the more prominent display of tax-inclusive prices is associated with significant reductions in consumer tax incidence, demand, and ticket revenues along more heavily taxed itineraries. In particular, the fraction of unit taxes that airlines passed onto consumers fell by roughly 75 cents for every dollar of tax. These results present evidence of consumer inattention in a novel institutional setting featuring quasi-experimental variation in tax salience, economically significant tax amounts, and endogenous price responses.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190200
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Cumulative Impacts of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: Experimental Evidence from Indonesia,"Nur Cahyadi, Rema Hanna, Benjamin Olken, Rizal Prima, Elan Satriawan and Ekki Syamsulhakim","Conditional cash transfers provide income and promote human capital investments. Yet evaluating their longitudinal impacts is hard, as most experimental evaluations treat control locations after a few years. We examine such impacts in Indonesia after six years, where the program rollout left the experiment largely intact. We find static effects on many targeted indicators: childbirth using trained professionals increased dramatically, and under-15 children not in school fell by half. We observe impacts requiring cumulative investments: stunting fell by 23 percent. While human capital accumulation increased, the transfers did not lead to transformative economic change for recipient households.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190245
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Discrete Prices and the Incidence and Efficiency of Excise Taxes,Christopher T. Conlon and Nirupama L. Rao,"This paper uses UPC-level data to examine the relationship between excise taxes, retail prices, and consumer welfare in the distilled spirits market. We document a nominal rigidity in retail prices that arises because firms largely choose prices that end in 99 cents and change prices in whole-dollar increments. A correctly specified model, like an ordered logit, takes this discreteness into account when predicting the effects of alternative taxes. Explicitly accounting for price points substantially impacts estimates of tax incidence and the excess burden cost of tax revenue. Meaningful nonmonotonicities in these quantities expand the potential considerations in setting excise taxes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20160391
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Can Rationing Increase Welfare? Theory and an Application to India's Ration Shop System,Lucie Gadenne,"In many developing countries, households can purchase limited quantities of goods at a fixed subsidized price through ration shops. This paper asks whether the characteristics of developing countries explain why governments use such systems. I find an equity-efficiency trade-off: an efficiency-maximizing government will never use ration shops, but a welfare-maximizing one might to redistribute and provide insurance. Welfare gains of ration shops will be highest for necessity goods and goods with high price risk. I calibrate the model for India and find that ration shops are welfare improving for three of the four goods sold through the system today.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180659

Cash for Clunkers, Household Liquidity, and Aggregate Demand","Daniel Green, Brian Melzer, Jonathan Parker and Arcenis Rojas","This paper evaluates the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS) by comparing the vehicle purchases and disposals of households with eligible ""clunkers"" to those of households with similar but ineligible vehicles. CARS caused roughly 500,000 purchases during the program period. The provision of liquidity, through a rebate usable as a down payment, was critical in generating this large response. Participation was rare among households that owned clunkers with outstanding loans, which required loan repayment. This decline in participation is attributed to households' preference for lower down payments and distinguished from the effects of income, other indebtedness, and the program subsidy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170122

Combining comprehensive business registries and predictive analytics, we present estimates of entrepreneurial quantity and quality from 1988 to 2014. Rather than a secular pattern of declining business dynamism, our quality-adjusted measures follow a cyclical pattern sensitive to economic and capital market conditions. Consistent with the role of investment cycles as a driver of high-growth entrepreneurship, our results highlight the role of economic and institutional conditions as a driver of both initial entrepreneurial quality and the scaling of new ventures over time.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170498
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Decompositions and Policy Consequences of an Extraordinary Decline in Air Pollution from Electricity Generation,"Stephen Holland, Erin Mansur, Nicholas Muller and Andrew Yates","Using integrated assessment models, we calculate the economic value of the extraordinary decline in emissions from US power plants. Annual local and global air pollution damages fell from 245 to 133 billion USD over 2010–2017. Decomposition shows changes in emission rates and generation shares among coal and gas plants account for more of this decline than changes in renewable generation, electricity consumption, and damage valuations. Econometrically estimated marginal damages declined in the East from 8.6 to 6 cents per kWh. Marginal damages increased slightly in the West and Texas. These estimates indicate electric vehicles are now cleaner on average than gasoline vehicles.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190390

AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Optimal Income Taxation with Present Bias,Benjamin Lockwood,"Work often entails up-front effort costs in exchange for delayed benefits, and mounting evidence documents present bias over effort in the face of such delays. This paper studies the implications for the optimal income tax. Optimal tax rates are computed for present-biased workers who choose multiple dimensions of labor effort, some of which occur prior to compensation. Present bias reduces optimal tax rates, with a larger effect when the elasticity of taxable income is high. Optimal marginal tax rates may be negative at low incomes, providing an alternative, corrective rationale for work subsidies like the Earned Income Tax Credit.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180762

Fackler, Markus Nagler and Monika Schnitzer","Is compulsory licensing an effective antitrust remedy to increase innovation? To answer this question, we analyze the 1956 consent decree that settled an antitrust lawsuit against Bell, a vertically integrated monopolist charged with foreclosing the telecommunications equipment market. Bell was forced to license all its existing patents royalty-free, including those not related to telecommunications. We identify the effect of the consent decree on follow-on innovations building on Bell patents by using exactly matched non-Bell patents as control group. We show that the consent decree led to a lasting increase in innovation but only in markets outside the telecommunications sector.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20190086

Innocent civilians were killed and misrepresented as guerillas (a phenomenon known in Colombia as ""false positives""). There were significantly more false positives during the period of high-powered incentives in municipalities with weaker judicial institutions and where a higher share of brigades were commanded by colonels, who have stronger career concerns than generals. In municipalities with a higher share of colonels, the high-powered incentives period also coincided with a worsening of local judicial institutions and no discernible improvement in overall security.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180168
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,The Rise of Working Mothers and the 1975 Earned Income Tax Credit,Jacob Bastian,"The rise of working mothers radically changed the US economy and the role of women in society. In one of the first studies of the 1975 introduction of the Earned Income Tax Credit, I find that this program increased maternal employment by 6 percent, representing 1 million mothers and an elasticity of 0.58. The EITC may help explain why the US has long had such a high fraction of working mothers despite few childcare subsidies or parental leave policies. I also find suggestive evidence that this influx of working mothers affected social attitudes and led to higher approval of working women.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180039

We generate exogenous variation in participation using the passage of preregistration laws, which allow the young to register before being eligible to vote. After documenting that preregistration promotes youth enfranchisement, we show that preregistration shifts state government spending toward higher education, the type of spending for which the young have the strongest preference. A 1 percent increase in youth voter turnout generates a 0.77 percent increase in higher education spending. The results collectively suggest political responsiveness to the needs of the newly enfranchised constituency.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180203

This paper identifies causal peer effects in residential water conservation during the summer using variation from movers. We classify high-resolution remote sensing images to provide evidence that conversions of green landscaping to dry landscaping are a primary determinant of the reductions in water consumption. We also find suggestive evidence that without a price signal, peer effects are muted, indicating a possible complementarity between information and prices.

Martin Boyer, Philippe De Donder, Claude Fluet, Marie-Louise Leroux and Pierre-Carl Michaud","This paper conducts a stated-choice experiment where respondents are asked to rate various insurance products aimed to protect against financial risks associated with long-term care needs. Using exogenous variation in prices from the survey design and individual cost estimates, these stated-choice probabilities are used to predict market equilibrium for long-term care insurance. Our results are twofold. First, information frictions are pervasive. Second, measuring the welfare losses associated with frictions in a framework that also allows for selection, it is found that information frictions reduce equilibrium take-up and lead to large welfare losses, while selection plays little role.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180227
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Adopt or Innovate: Understanding Technological Responses to Cap-and-Trade,Raphael Calel,"One important motivation for creating cap-and-trade programs for carbon emissions is the expectation that they will stimulate much-needed low-carbon innovation. I construct a new panel of British firms to investigate this hypothesis, finding that the European carbon market has encouraged greater low-carbon patenting and R&D spending among regulated firms without necessarily driving short-term reductions in carbon intensity of output. This stands in contrast to past cap-and-trade programs, which have primarily spurred adoption of existing pollution control technologies, with little effect on innovation. I discuss how to reconcile these contrasting findings and implications for the future of carbon markets.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180135
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,"Criminal Deterrence When There Are Offsetting Risks: Traffic Cameras, Vehicular Accidents, and Public Safety",Justin Gallagher and Paul Fisher,"Numerous cities have enacted electronic monitoring programs at traffic intersections in an effort to reduce the high number of vehicle accidents. The rationale is that the higher expected fines for running a red light will induce drivers to stop and lead to fewer cross-road collisions. However, the cameras also incentivize drivers to accept a greater accident risk from stopping. We evaluate the termination of a monitoring program via a voter referendum using 12 years of geocoded police accident data. We find that the cameras changed the composition of accidents but no evidence of a reduction in total accidents or injuries.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170674
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Patient Cost-Sharing and Healthcare Utilization in Early Childhood: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design,"Hsing-Wen Han, Hsien-Ming Lien and Tzu-Ting Yang","This paper estimates the price elasticity of healthcare utilization in early childhood. We employ a regression discontinuity design by exploiting a subsidy that reduces patient cost-sharing for children under age 3 in Taiwan. Using longitudinal medical claims of over 410,000 children, we find a modest price elasticity of outpatient expenditure (e.g., −0.10 for regular outpatient care). Furthermore, increased cost-sharing at age 3 largely decreases the chance of visiting high-intensity healthcare providers (e.g., teaching hospitals) for minor illnesses. In contrast, children's utilization of inpatient care is price insensitive, providing a rationale for full inpatient care coverage to children.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170009
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Price-Linked Subsidies and Imperfect Competition in Health Insurance,Sonia Jaffe and Mark Shepard,"Policymakers subsidizing health insurance often face uncertainty about future market prices. We study the implications of one policy response: linking subsidies to prices to target a given postsubsidy premium. We show that these price-linked subsidies weaken competition, raising prices for the government and/or consumers. However, price-linking also ties subsidies to health care cost shocks, which may be desirable. Evaluating this tradeoff empirically, using a model estimated with Massachusetts insurance exchange data, we find that price-linking increases prices 1–6 percent, and much more in less competitive markets. For cost uncertainty reasonable in a mature market, these losses outweigh the benefits of price-linking.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180198

This paper uses administrative microdata to examine the impact of enforcement efforts on taxpayers' reporting of offshore accounts and income. We find that enforcement caused approximately 50,000 individuals to disclose offshore accounts with a combined value of about $100 billion. Most disclosures happened outside offshore voluntary disclosure programs by individuals who never admitted prior noncompliance. Disclosed accounts were concentrated in countries often characterized as tax havens. Enforcement-driven disclosures increased annual reported capital income by $2–$4 billion, corresponding to $0.6–$1.2 billion in additional tax revenue.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180410
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Is Occupational Licensing a Barrier to Interstate Migration?,Janna E. Johnson and Morris M.

We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations, proxying for the difficulty of the regulations by comparing state-specific licensed occupations to those with national licensing exams. Our empirical strategy also uses individuals who move a long distance, removing the influence of occupation characteristics and self-selection of migration-averse individuals into licensed occupations. Our estimates show that occupational licensing reduces interstate migration, but the magnitude of the effect can only account for a small part of the overall decline in recent decades.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170704

I examine the Brazilian water and sanitation sector, which presents a natural experiment of shared provision between state and municipal companies. Using a difference-in-differences framework, I study a legal reform that clarified the relationship between municipal and state providers and eliminated any takeover threat by state companies.

AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Misunderstanding Nonlinear Prices: Evidence from a Natural Experiment on Residential Electricity Demand,Blake Shaffer,"This paper examines how consumers respond to nonlinear prices. Exploiting a natural experiment with electricity consumers in British Columbia, I find evidence that some households severely misunderstand nonlinear prices—incorrectly perceiving that the marginal price applies to all consumption, not simply the last unit. While small in number, the exaggerated responses by these households have a large effect in aggregate, masking an otherwise predominant response to average price. Largely unexplored in the literature, this type of misunderstanding has important economic, policy, and methodological implications beyond electricity markets. I estimate the welfare loss for these households to be the equivalent of 10 percent of annual electricity expenditure.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180061

Difference-in-difference estimates show a 17 percent increase in total R&D among eligible firms. The impact was larger for firms that took the tax credits as refunds because they had no current tax liability. Contract R&D expenditures were more elastic than the R&D wage bill.

Using county-level variation in the timing and magnitude of sanctions linked to student loan default rates, we estimate that sanctioned for-profits experience a 68 percent decrease in annual enrollment following sanction receipt. Enrollment losses due to for-profit sanctions are 60–70 percent offset by increased enrollment within local community colleges, where students are less likely to default on federal student loans. Conversely, for-profit sanctions decrease enrollment in local unsanctioned for-profit competitors, likely due to improved information about local options and reputational spillovers.

AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Revisiting the Effects of Unemployment Insurance Extensions on Unemployment: A Measurement-Error-Corrected Regression Discontinuity Approach,"Steven Dieterle, Otavio Bartalotti and Quentin Brummet","This study documents two potential biases in recent analyses of UI benefit extensions using boundary-based identification: bias from using county-level aggregates and bias from across-border policy spillovers. To examine the first bias, the analysis uses a regression discontinuity approach that accounts for measurement error in county-level aggregates. These results suggest much smaller effects than previous studies, casting doubt on the applicability of border-based designs. The analysis then shows substantial spillover effects of UI benefit duration on across-border work patterns, consistent with increased tightness in high-benefit states and providing evidence against a dominant vacancy reduction response to UI extensions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20160439

We exploit discontinuous jumps in retake probabilities at multiples of 100, driven by left-digit bias, to estimate retaking's causal effects. Retaking substantially improves SAT scores and increases four-year college enrollment rates, particularly for low-income and URM students.

We find that UI receipt cuts welfare (TANF) receipt by half among low-earning UI applicants but has no impact on SNAP or Medicaid usage. However, because welfare participation is low in this population, overall crowdout is small.

We present new evidence based on a large-scale program available to high-achieving, low-income students for attending high-quality colleges in Colombia. RD estimates show financial aid eligibility raised immediate enrollment by 56.5 to 86.5 percent, depending on the complier population. This rise, driven by matriculation at private, high-quality colleges, closed the SES enrollment gap among high achievers. Moreover, a DID approach suggests enrollment of aid-ineligible students also improved because college supply expanded in response to heightened demand.

I find that homophily goes beyond direct links: students also prefer racially homogeneous indirect friends, while there is heterophily in income. I simulate policies reallocating students across schools. Race-based policies have nonlinear effects on within-school segregation and other network features such as clustering and centrality.

A model is presented where residential externalities lead to multiple equilibria at the neighborhood level. Specifically, neighborhood development requires the coordination of developers and residents, without which it may remain vacant even with sound fundamentals. Given this mechanism, existing strategic visions to revitalize Detroit are evaluated within a quantitative spatial model that can rationalize Detroit's current allocations.

Student fixed effects models using 10 million students who retook the PSATs show that hotter school days in the years before the test was taken reduce scores, with extreme heat being particularly damaging. Weekend and summer temperatures have little impact, suggesting heat directly disrupts learning time. New nationwide, school-level measures of air conditioning penetration suggest patterns consistent with such infrastructure largely offsetting heat's effects. Without air conditioning, a 1°F hotter school year reduces that year's learning by 1 percent.

The study is based on a legislative pilot carried out in Illinois in 2006, under which mortgage counseling was triggered by applicant credit scores or by their choice of ""risky mortgages."" Low-credit score applicants for whom counselor review was mandatory did not materially alter their contract choice. Conversely, higher credit score applicants who could avoid counseling by choosing nonrisky mortgages did so, decreasing their propensity for high-risk contracts between 10 and 40 percent.

We examine the consumer response to the 2010 BP oil spill and test how BP's investment in the 2000–2008 ""Beyond Petroleum"" green advertising campaign affected this response. We find evidence consistent with consumer punishment: BP station margins and volumes declined by 2.9 cents per gallon and 4.2 percent, respectively, in the month after the spill. However, pre-spill advertising significantly dampened the price response, and may have reduced brand switching by BP stations.

The growing capacity in emerging economies to pay for a US education provided opportunities for universities to recover revenues from full-fare-paying foreign students. We estimate that between 1996 and 2012, a 10 percent reduction in state appropriations led to an increase in foreign enrollment of 16 percent at public research universities.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170620
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,The Long-Run Impacts of Specialized Programming for High-Achieving Students,Sarah Cohodes,"I evaluate long-run academic impacts of specialized programming for high-achieving students by analyzing Advanced Work Class (AWC), an accelerated curriculum delivered in dedicated classrooms for fourth through sixth graders in Boston Public Schools. Fuzzy regression discontinuity estimates show that AWC has positive yet imprecise impacts on test scores and improves longer-term outcomes, increasing high school graduation and college enrollment. These gains are driven by black and Latino students. An analysis of mechanisms highlights the importance of staying ""on track"" throughout high school, with little evidence that AWC gains result from peer effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180315
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,"Federal Coal Program Reform, the Clean Power Plan, and the Interaction of Upstream and Downstream Climate Policies","Todd Gerarden, W. Spencer Reeder and James H. Stock","Can supply-side environmental policies that limit the extraction of fossil fuels reduce CO2 emissions? This paper studies interactions between a specific supply-side policy—a carbon surcharge on federal coal royalties—and regulation of emissions from the power sector under the Clean Air Act. Estimates from a detailed dynamic model of the power sector suggest that, absent new downstream regulation, a royalty surcharge equal to the social cost of carbon would generate three-quarters of the emissions reductions originally projected for the Clean Power Plan (CPP), with an average abatement cost roughly equal to the social cost of carbon. Were the CPP in place, the royalty surcharge would reduce emissions by reducing leakage and causing the CPP to be nonbinding in some scenarios.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20160246
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,"Do Credit Market Shocks Affect the Real Economy? Quasi-experimental Evidence from the Great Recession and ""Normal"" Economic Times","Michael Greenstone, Alexandre Mas and Hoai-Luu Nguyen","Using comprehensive data on bank lending and establishment-level outcomes from 1997–2010, this paper finds that small business lending is an unimportant determinant of small business and overall economic activity. A shift-share style research design is implemented to predict county-level lending shocks using variation in preexisting bank market shares and bank supply shifts. Counties with negative predicted lending shocks experienced declines in small business loan originations, indicating that it is costly to switch lenders. However, small business loan originations have an economically insignificant and generally statistically insignificant impact on both small firm and overall employment during the Great Recession and normal times.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20160005
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,The Returns to a Large Community College Program: Evidence from Admissions Lotteries,Michel Grosz,"This paper estimates the labor market returns to the associate's degree in nursing (ADN), which is one of the most popular community college programs. I use student-level academic and earnings records across two decades for all community college students in California. I leverage random variation from admissions lotteries to produce causal estimates of the effect of the ADN on earnings and employment at a single large ADN program. Enrolling in the program increases earnings by 44 percent and the probability of working in the health care industry by 19 percentage points. These estimates are similar to ones in models that do not use the lottery variation but do control for individual fixed effects and individual-specific linear time trends, which I also estimate in a wider set of institutions where lottery estimates are not possible. In light of concerns about nursing shortages, I estimate that the economic benefit of expanding an ADN program by one seat far outweighs the costs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170506
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Optimal Income Taxation with Unemployment and Wage Responses: A Sufficient Statistics Approach,"Kory Kroft, Kavan Kucko, Etienne Lehmann and Johannes Schmieder","We derive a sufficient statistics tax formula in a model that incorporates unemployment and endogenous wages to study the shape of the optimal income tax. Key sufficient statistics are the macro employment response to taxation, the micro and macro participation response to taxation, and the wage-moderating effect of tax progressivity. We empirically implement the tax formula by estimating the micro and macro elasticities using policy variation from the United States. Our results suggest that the optimal tax more closely resembles a negative income tax than an earned income tax credit relative to the case where unemployment and wage responses are ignored.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180033
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Do Human Capital Decisions Respond to the Returns to Education? Evidence from DACA,"Elira Kuka, Na'ama Shenhav and Kevin Shih","This paper studies human capital responses to the availability of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provides temporary work authorization and deferral from deportation for undocumented, high-school-educated youth. We use a sample of young adults that migrated to the United States as children to implement a difference-in-difference design that compares noncitizen immigrants (""eligible"") to citizen immigrants (""ineligible"") over time. We find that DACA significantly increased high school attendance and high school graduation rates, reducing the citizen-noncitizen gap in graduation by 40 percent. We also find positive, though imprecise, impacts on college attendance.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180352
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Where Does Multinational Investment Go with Territorial Taxation? Evidence from the United Kingdom,Li Liu,"In 2009, the United Kingdom changed from a worldwide to a territorial tax system, abolishing dividend taxes on foreign repatriation from many low-tax countries. This paper assesses the causal effect of territorial taxation on real investments, using a unique dataset for multinational affiliates in 27 European countries and employing the difference-in-differences approach. It finds that the territorial reform has increased the investment rate of UK multinationals by 16.7 percentage points in low-tax countries. In the absence of any significant investment reduction elsewhere, the findings represent a likely increase in total outbound investment by UK multinationals.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20180592
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Learning Job Skills from Colleagues at Work: Evidence from a Field Experiment Using Teacher Performance Data,"John P. Papay, Eric S. Taylor, John H. Tyler and Mary E. Laski","We study a program designed to encourage learning from coworkers among school teachers. In an experiment, we document gains in job performance when high- and low-skilled teachers are paired and asked to work together on improving their skills. Pairs are matched on specific skills measured in prior evaluations. Each pair includes a target teacher who scores low in one or more of 19 skills and a partner who scores high in (many of) the target's deficient skills. Student achievement improved 0.12 standard deviations in low-skilled teachers' classrooms. Improvements are likely the result of target teachers learning skills from their partner.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170709
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,Retirement Lock and Prescription Drug Insurance: Evidence from Medicare Part D,Gal Wettstein,"I examine whether lack of an individual market for prescription drug insurance causes individuals to delay retirement. Exploiting the 2006 introduction of Medicare Part D, which subsidized drug insurance for Americans over age 65, I use a triple-differences design that compares labor outcomes of individuals with retiree health insurance up to age 65 to those with insurance for life, before and after age 65, before and after 2006. I find that those with benefits only to age 65 decreased full-time work by 8.4 percentage points, of which 70 percent was due to transitions to part-time work.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20160560
AEJ: Economic Policy,2020,The Marginal Cost of Traffic Congestion and Road Pricing: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Beijing,"Jun Yang, Avralt-Od Purevjav and Shanjun Li",Severe traffic congestion is ubiquitous in large urban centers. This paper provides the first causal estimate of the relationship between traffic density and speed and optimal congestion charges using real-time fine-scale traffic data in Beijing. The identification relies on plausibly exogenous variation in traffic density induced by Beijing's driving restriction policy. Optimal congestion charges range from 5 to 39 cents per km depending on time and location. Road pricing would increase traffic speed by 11 percent within the city center and lead to an annual welfare gain of ¥1.5 billion from reduced congestion and revenue of ¥10.5 billion.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170195
