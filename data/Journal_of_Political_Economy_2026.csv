Journal of Political Economy,2026,The Economics of Scaling Early Childhood Programs: Lessons from the Chicago School,John List,"Many ideas succeed in small trials but weaken considerably at scale. Using early childhood investment as a case study, this paper develops a dynamic microfounded human capital model stylized in the Chicago tradition. The framework features optimizing agents, complementary skill formation, and a policymaker choosing scaling strategies. The model shows that naive extrapolation from pilots systematically overestimates societal impact by overlooking voltage drops: declining benefit-cost profiles due to unrepresentative samples and contexts. Optimal scaling requires option C thinking, a mechanism-based design approach that anticipates these failures through backward induction from real-world implementation constraints. Studies in this special issue enrich the model’s insights.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/739436
Journal of Political Economy,2026,A Study of the Microdynamics of Early-Childhood Learning,James Heckman and Jin Zhou,"This paper investigates the weekly evolution of skills as measured by unique data from a widely emulated early-childhood home-visiting program in rural China. The design of the study avoids input endogeneity issues and lack of comparable measures of skills that plague previous studies. Skills, nominally classified as the same, in fact, do not appear to share a common unit scale across levels. They are produced by skill- and life cycle–stage-specific learning processes. A novel dynamic stochastic skill production model for multiple skills is developed, aligning with empirical evidence. The model can explain the “fade-out” and recovery of measures of learning through the operation of a controlled stochastic process.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/739256
Journal of Political Economy,2026,Why Don’t Struggling Students Do Their Homework? Disentangling Motivation and Study Productivity as Drivers of Human Capital Formation,"Christopher Cotton, Brent R. Hickman, John List, Joseph Price and Sutanuka Roy","Using field experimental data (study time tracking and randomized incentives), we identify a structural model of learning. Student effort is influenced by external costs/benefits and unobserved heterogeneity: motivation (willingness to study) and productivity (conversion rate of time into skill). We estimate academic labor supply elasticities and skill technology. Productivity and motivation are uncorrelated. Low productivity, not low motivation, is the stronger predictor of academic struggles. School quality augments productivity and accelerates skill production. We find that dynamic skill complementarities arise mainly from children’s aging and from a feedback loop between investment activity and productivity rather than from carrying forward past skill stocks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738479
Journal of Political Economy,2026,Child Skill Production: Accounting for Parental and Market-Based Time and Goods Investments,"Elizabeth Caucutt, Lance Lochner, Joseph Mullins and Youngmin Park","Families invest time, home goods/services, and market-based childcare in their children. We study these investments, focusing on the role of parental human capital and the substitutability of inputs in skill production. We develop a relative demand estimation strategy that uses intratemporal optimality to estimate the substitutability and relative productivity of inputs. We show how relative demand restrictions simplify and improve estimation of the dynamics of skill production. We estimate the skill production technology for American children aged 5–12, finding moderately strong complementarity between inputs and little difference in the technology by parental education. Counterfactual simulations show that estimated input complementarity has important implications for policies that subsidize inputs or provide free childcare.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738480
Journal of Political Economy,2026,Parenting with Patience: Parental Incentives and Child Development,"Daniela Del Boca, Christopher Flinn, Ewout Verriest and Matthew Wiswall","We construct a dynamic model of child development where forward-looking parents and children jointly take actions to increase the child’s cognitive and noncognitive skills within a Markov perfect equilibrium framework. In addition to time and money investments in their child, parents also choose whether to use explicit incentives to increase the child’s self-investment, which may reduce the child’s future intrinsic motivation to invest by reducing the child’s discount factor. We use the estimated model parameters to show that the use of extrinsic motivation has large costs in terms of the child’s future incentives to invest in themselves.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738481
Journal of Political Economy,2026,Effects of Multigenerational Exposure to Early-Life Advantage: Lessons from a Primate Study,"Amanda M. Dettmer, James Heckman, Juan Pantano, Victor Ronda and Stephen J. Suomi","This paper uses three decades of data on rhesus monkeys to investigate the multigenerational effects of early-life advantage. Monkeys and their offspring are both randomly assigned to be reared together or apart from their mothers. For the first time, we document the intergenerational complementarity of early-life advantage, where the benefits of maternal rearing are present only for offspring of mothers who were themselves mother reared. This illustrates the intergenerational dynamics of social advantage and how the value of an intervention can depend on the experiences of the previous generation. Our paper demonstrates how studies of primates can inform human development.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738483
Journal of Political Economy,2026,It Takes a Village: The Economics of Parenting with Neighborhood and Peer Effects,"Francesco Agostinelli, Matthias Doepke, Giuseppe Sorrenti and Fabrizio Zilibotti","During adolescence, peer interactions become increasingly central to children’s development, whereas the direct influence of parents wanes. Nevertheless, parents can continue to exert leverage by shaping their children’s peer groups. We construct and estimate a model of parenting with peer and neighborhood effects where parents intervene in peer formation and show that the model captures empirical patterns of skill accumulation, parenting style, and peer characteristics among US high school students. We find that interventions that move children to better neighborhoods lose impact when they are scaled up, because parents’ equilibrium responses push against successful integration with the new peer group.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/739334
Journal of Political Economy,2026,Mentoring and Schooling Decisions: Causal Evidence,"Armin Falk, Fabian Kosse and Pia Pinger","Inequality of opportunity occurs when children of equal academic performance are sent to different-quality schools because their parents differ in socioeconomic status. We demonstrate that children from low–socioeconomic status (SES) families are significantly less likely to enter the academic track, even after conditioning on prior school performance. We then provide causal evidence that a low-intensity mentoring program can improve the education outcomes of low-SES children and reduce inequality of opportunity. Low-SES children randomly assigned to mentors for 1 year are 20% more likely to enter a high-track program. Mentorship affects both parents and children and has positive long-term implications for children’s educational trajectories. The effects are enduring and scalable.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738484
Journal of Political Economy,2026,Exercise Improves Academic Performance,"Alexander W. Cappelen, Gary Charness, Mathias Ekström, Uri Gneezy and Bertil Tungodden","In a randomized controlled trial, we test whether removal of a barrier to exercise can improve academic performance. We find strong support for this hypothesis: University students who were provided with a free gym card exercised more and had a significant improvement in academic performance. The treated students were less likely to drop out of classes and to fail at the exam. We provide evidence showing that exercise caused a healthier lifestyle and increased perceived self-control, which ultimately improved academic performance. The study demonstrates that removing barriers to physical activity can be an important tool for improving educational achievements.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738251
Journal of Political Economy,2026,A Structural Meta-Analysis of Welfare Reform Experiments and Their Impacts on Children,Joseph Mullins,"Using a model of maternal labor supply and investment in children, this paper synthesizes the findings from three separate welfare reform experiments across six sites. The proposed model maps variation in experimental design to parameters that define labor supply behavior, childcare use, and the importance of money and childcare arrangements in the development of child skills. The estimation procedure—which aggregates available evidence to identify the model’s key causal parameters—amounts to a structural meta-analysis. A number of counterfactuals underscore the utility of this model-based approach for understanding the mechanisms behind treatment effects and the roles played by heterogeneity and selection in shaping impacts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738482
Journal of Political Economy,2026,Rules versus Discretion: Treatment of Mental Illness in US Adolescents,Emily Cuddy and Janet Currie,"Many mental health disorders start in adolescence, and appropriate initial treatment may improve trajectories. But what is appropriate treatment? We use a large national database of insurance claims to examine the impact of initial mental health treatment on the outcomes of adolescent children over the next 2 years, where treatment is either consistent with US Food and Drug Administration guidelines, consistent with looser guidelines published by professional societies (gray area prescribing), or inconsistent with any guidelines (red-flag prescribing). We find that red-flag prescribing increases self-harm, use of emergency rooms, and health care costs, suggesting that treatment guidelines effectively scale up good treatment in practice.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/738249
