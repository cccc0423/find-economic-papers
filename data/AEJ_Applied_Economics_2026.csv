AEJ: Applied Economics,2026,Direct and Indirect Effects of Vaccines: Evidence from COVID-19,"Seth Freedman, Daniel W. Sacks, Kosali Simon and Coady Wing","We estimate direct and indirect vaccine effectiveness and assess how far the infection-reducing externality extends from the vaccinated, a key input to policy decisions. Our empirical strategy uses nearly universal microdata from a single state and relies on the six-month delay between 12- and 11-year-old COVID vaccine eligibility. Vaccination reduces cases by 80 percent, the direct effect. This protection spills over to close contacts, producing a household-level indirect effect about three-fourths as large as the direct effect. However, indirect effects do not extend to schoolmates. Our results highlight vaccine reach as important to consider when designing policy for infectious disease.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230717
AEJ: Applied Economics,2026,From Immediate Acceptance to Deferred Acceptance: Effects on School Admissions and Achievement in England,"Camille Terrier, Parag A. Pathak and Kevin Ren","Countries and cities around the world increasingly rely on centralized systems for student placement. Two algorithms, deferred acceptance (DA) and immediate acceptance (IA), are widespread. We investigate the effects of the national ban of IA in England. Before the ban, 49 local authorities used DA and 16 used IA; all switched to DA afterward. We find that the elimination of IA reduces measures of school quality for low-SES students more than high-SES students.This effect is primarily driven by a decrease in low-SES admissions at selective schools. Our findings point to an unintended consequence of the IA to DA transition.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230056
AEJ: Applied Economics,2026,Breaking Bad: How Health Shocks Prompt Crime,"Steffen Andersen, Elin Colmsjö, Gianpaolo Parise and Kim Peijnenburg","Exploiting plausibly exogenous variations in the timing of cancer diagnoses, we establish that health shocks elicit a large and persistent increase in the probability of committing a crime. This effect materializes in a substantial rise in both first crimes and re-offenses. We uncover evidence for two mechanisms. First, an economic motive leads individuals to compensate the loss of legal revenues with illegal earnings. Second, cancer patients face lower expected cost of punishment through a lower survival probability. Welfare programs that alleviate the economic repercussions of health shocks are effective at mitigating the ensuing negative externality on society.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220769
AEJ: Applied Economics,2026,Highway to Hitler,Nico Voigtländer and Hans-Joachim Voth,"We show that the building of the Autobahn network in Nazi Germany boosted popular support for Adolf Hitler, helping to entrench the Nazi dictatorship. Direct local economic benefits are unlikely to explain the effect. Instead, it reflects successful propaganda: The regime portrayed the Autobahn as a symbol of recovery and the end of austerity. Support rose particularly strongly where highway construction coincided with greater radio availability and in politically unstable regions. Our findings suggest that visible infrastructure projects can raise support for autocratic regimes when voters are led to associate them with economic progress and an end to political instability.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180816
AEJ: Applied Economics,2026,"Rising Concentration of Household Shopping, Superstar Firms, and the Implications for Retail Markups",Justin H. Leung and Zhonglin Li,"This paper documents an increase in the concentration of household shopping in the United States retail sector from 2004 to 2019. Despite a growing number of stores, households visit fewer stores, do more one-stop shopping, and increasingly shop at different retailers from each other. We find that the increasing availability of superstar retailers, the rise in product variety within stores, and the rise of online shopping contribute to these trends. We explore how these trends are linked with rising retail markups. Our calibration suggests a 5–10 percentage point increase in aggregate retail markups during this period.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20240081
AEJ: Applied Economics,2026,Divine Policy: The Impact of Religion in Government,"Jeanet Sinding Bentzen, Alessandro Pizzigolotto and Lena Lindbjerg Sperling","Can policies shape personal values and beliefs? To examine, we exploit the staggered introduction of faith-based initiatives across US states. Our difference-in-differences analysis reveals that the initiatives strengthened religiosity and conservative-religious social views, such as attitudes against homosexuals. The evidence points to causal effects; we find no systematic differences prior to implementation, the results are robust to restricting comparison to contiguous counties and to conducting triple-differences estimation exploiting treatment heterogeneity. A key explanation, in line with standard models of religion and supported by data on nonprofit organizations, is that the initiatives facilitated the establishment of faith-based organizations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20240018
AEJ: Applied Economics,2026,The Returns to Physical Capital in Knowledge Production: Evidence from Lab Disasters,Stefano Baruffaldi and Fabian Gaessler,"We investigate the nature and relevance of physical capital in knowledge production. Exploiting adverse events in research laboratories, we find that scientists experience a persistent reduction in research output if they lose specialized physical capital—equipment and material they created over time for a particular research purpose. In contrast, they recover in productivity if they only lose generic physical capital. Scientists in older laboratories, who presumably lose more obsolete physical capital, are more likely to change their research direction and recover. These findings suggest that scientists' investments into their own physical capital yield lasting returns but also create path dependence.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220629
AEJ: Applied Economics,2026,Disadvantaging Rivals: Vertical Integration in the Pharmaceutical Market,"Charles Gray, Abby Alpert and Neeraj Sood","The pharmaceutical market has experienced a wave of vertical integration between pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurers in recent years. Using a unique dataset on insurer-PBM contracts, we document increasing vertical integration in Medicare Part D. Next, we evaluate the effects of a large insurer-PBM merger in 2015, assessing the trade-offs of vertical integration—harms to competition on the one hand and improved efficiency on the other. We find premium increases for rival insurers post-merger, consistent with vertically integrated PBMs raising costs through input foreclosure. We find no evidence of benefits to consumers of the merged firm from lower premiums.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20240011
