Journal of Public Economics,2025,Quantifying misallocation of public housing,"Jennifer Buurma-Olsen, Hans R.A. Koster, Jos van Ommeren and Jort Sinninghe Damsté","We empirically investigate how rent control combined with the use of a non-market allocation mechanism – centralised waiting lists – affects the efficiency of housing allocation among public-housing tenants. We show that, on average, Dutch public-housing tenants consume a house whose value differs by 7.5% from what they would consume under an efficient allocation. This entails particularly large transfers in housing consumption from younger households to older households. The annual welfare loss arising from misallocation within the public-housing sector is modest, estimated at around €65 per tenant.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002081
Journal of Public Economics,2025,Correlation in state and local tax changes,"Scott Baker, Pawel Janas and Lorenz Kueng","Empirical research in public economics, including our own, often uses variation in state and local taxes as an empirical laboratory to estimate causal relationships. A key concern is that other taxes might change at the same time. To assess this concern, we develop a dataset of state (1977–2022) and local (2000–2022) tax rates and revenue from personal income, corporate income, property, sales, and excise taxes. This new dataset generates two key results. First, we find that taxes of different types tend to co-move within a jurisdiction: a tax change of one type can more than double the likelihood of a second tax type changing in the same year. Local tax changes also co-move with tax changes enacted by the state they are located in. This positive correlation can upwardly bias elasticity estimates, but only moderately. For example, regressing state economic outcomes on the full set of state tax changes yields elasticities that are about 10%–30% smaller than those obtained from using a single tax type in isolation. Second, we document that the mix of taxes across state and local jurisdictions is very different, and that these differences have become more pronounced over time as jurisdictions have increasingly become reliant on the single tax type — sales, personal or corporate income tax — that was most prominent for them in the earliest part of our sample.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002111

Our findings indicate that adding regular interactive online recitation sessions to pure online courses leads to significant improvements in students’ exam scores, as well as increased levels of extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness. The positive effects on students’ academic achievements and personality traits can be attributed to students’ enhanced learning motivation and engagement and increased levels of parental inputs, respectively.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002214
Journal of Public Economics,2025,"Neighborhoods, perceived Inequality, and preferences for Redistribution: Evidence from Barcelona",Gerard Domènech-Arumí,"I study the effects of neighborhood-level inequality on perceived national-level inequality and preferences for redistribution. I construct a novel measure of local inequality using geolocated housing data and elicit perceptions and preferences from an original survey conducted in Barcelona. Local inequality is positively associated with perceived inequality but not with preferences for redistribution. I address endogenous sorting by exploiting quasi-random variation in exposure to new apartment buildings; this increases perceived inequality by 7% and has a positive but not statistically significant effect on demand for redistribution. Effects come from higher perceived income at the top. Local inequality shapes national-level inequality perceptions, but if it influences demand for redistribution, the effect is small. This work suggests that individuals extrapolate from their local environments when forming beliefs and highlights the importance of data granularity when studying neighborhood effects.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272400224X
Journal of Public Economics,2025,The environmental cost of power outages: Evidence from Delhi,Yatang Lin and Dana Kassem,"This paper examines an overlooked consequence of an unstable electricity supply: air pollution. Using a unique dataset with high-frequency records of outage events and pollution, we find that outages lead to a 0.4% and 1.3% increase in hourly NO2 and NO concentrations and a 0.4% increase in PM10 levels. This is likely attributable to the widespread use of highly polluting backup diesel generators. The environmental cost of outages exceeds the private cost for users when backup generators are adopted. Welfare analysis using bunching estimation highlights the importance of incorporating environmental benefits in the evaluation of policies aimed at mitigating outages.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002251

While the program sparked global interest as a blueprint for economic transformation, its effectiveness remains disputed. Using unique firm-level data, we examine the program’s objective to privatize the most competitive firms. We document that firms with higher baseline productivity are more likely to be privatized, yield higher prices, are more often acquired by West Germans, and are more likely to survive 20 years later. Inspecting the inner workings of the privatization agency, we illustrate challenges and lessons for how governments can design and implement industrial policy goals.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002275

Leveraging rich administrative data from Italy, we investigate the effects of a reform that, to increase job stability, reduced the firing costs for permanent employees and tightened the regulation of fixed-term contracts. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) design, we document that the reform had unintended effects, inducing firms to increase layoffs of low-skilled (LS) permanent employees and reduce hires of LS workers on fixed-term contracts. However, the reform had no effect on high-skilled workers or permanent hires. A theoretical search and matching model with heterogeneous skills and contract durations makes sense of our main findings.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002287
Journal of Public Economics,2025,How do business owners respond to a tax cut? Examining the 199A deduction for pass-through firms,"Lucas Goodman, Katherine Lim, Bruce Sacerdote and Andrew Whitten","We measure the responses of businesses and their owners to Section 199A, a deduction that reduced the effective tax rate on most U.S. pass-through business income beginning in 2018. Using tax records of individuals and businesses, we compare taxpayers with exogenously differing levels of exposure to the deduction, exploiting limitations within the statute. We find evidence of a 3 to 4 percent increase in reported business income eligible for the deduction during 2018 and 2019 for the more-exposed group relative to the less-exposed group. We also find some evidence of effects on specific hypothesized margins of adjustment. Partnerships reduced ineligible forms of compensation paid to owners by approximately 10 to 15 percent, in line with the incentives created by Section 199A, but S corporations did not reduce wages to owners. We find no evidence that Section 199A encouraged movements from employee to contractor status or increased contractor activity. Finally, we find little evidence of changes in real economic activity as measured by physical investment, wages to non-owners, or employment.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002299

Using administrative UI data merged with credit records and applications for Medicaid and SNAP, we show that UI withdrawal led to an increase in job-finding that was most pronounced among financially constrained individuals with limited available credit. The cost savings from higher job-finding came at the expense of increased demand for other government services and higher defaults. Our results highlight an important interaction between UI, household finances, and other social insurance programs.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002317
Journal of Public Economics,2025,Parents’ effective time endowment and divorce: Evidence from extended school days,"María Padilla-Romo, Cecilia Peluffo and Mariana Viollaz","Policies that extend the school day in elementary school provide an implicit childcare subsidy for families. As such, they can affect parents’ time allocation and family dynamics. This paper examines how extending the school day affects families by focusing on marriage dissolution. We exploit the staggered adoption of a policy that extended the availability of full-time elementary schools across different municipalities in Mexico. Using administrative data on divorces, we find that extending the school day by 3.5 h leads to a significant increase in divorce rates. Moreover, the effect grows with every year of municipalities’ exposure to full-time schooling. The effects are largely driven by municipalities with non-traditional social norms about marriage, divorce, and women’s priority to jobs, and by women in households with school-age children. Increased female labor force participation due to the availability of childcare is likely to be one of the mechanisms that relaxed restrictions on marriage dissolution.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272400238X
Journal of Public Economics,2025,Financial market exposure increases generalized trust,"Saumitra Jha, Moses Shayo and Chagai M. Weiss","How can we build trust, especially in polarized societies? We propose that exposure to broad financial markets—where individuals place their assets in the hands of large groups of unfamiliar agents who nonetheless have the incentive and ability to promote their interests—can contribute to generalized trust. In a randomized controlled trial, we encourage Israelis to hold or trade stocks for up to seven weeks. We find that participation in financial markets increases the probability of expressing generalized trust by about 6 percentage points, equivalent to a quarter of the control group mean. The effects seem to be driven by political partisans along the left–right spectrum in Israel, and are robust to negative price changes. Thus, trust is not only a cause but can also be an effect of participation in financial markets.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000015
Journal of Public Economics,2025,The psychological gains from COVID-19 vaccination,Manuel Bagues and Velichka Dimitrova,"We estimate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on psychological well-being using information from a large-scale panel survey representative of the UK population. Exploiting exogenous variation in the timing of vaccinations, we find that vaccination increases psychological well-being (GHQ-12) by 0.12 standard deviations, compensating for one-half of the deterioration in mental health caused by the pandemic. This improvement persists for at least two months, and is linked to higher engagement in social activities and a decrease in the self-reported likelihood of contracting COVID-19. The main beneficiaries are individuals who became mentally distressed during the pandemic, supporting their prioritization in vaccination roll-outs. Conversely, individuals who harbored concerns about potential vaccine side effects show no improvement in psychological well-being upon vaccination, underscoring the importance of public confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy. Accounting for the improvement in psychological well-being increases the benefits of vaccination by around 50%.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000027
Journal of Public Economics,2025,The effect of a ‘None of the above’ ballot paper option on voting behavior and election outcomes,"Attila Ambrus, Ben Greiner and Anita Zednik","We study how an explicit blank vote option “None of the above” (NOTA) on the ballot paper affects the behavior of voters and political candidates as well as election results. In a series of survey and laboratory experiments we identify a tradeoff regarding making NOTA an explicit voting option. On the one hand it can reduce the vote share of candidates who voters consider as protest candidates, who often come from the extremes of the political spectrum, making it less likely that such a protest candidate wins the election. On the other hand, anticipating the above effect, establishment candidates may care less about the electorate when NOTA is on the ballot. Evidence on voters’ reaction to NOTA comes from two online survey experiments conducted in the weeks preceding the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the 2016 Austrian run-off election for president. Participants were subjected to either the original ballot paper or to a ballot paper where we added a NOTA option. We investigate the dynamic response of politicians to the presence of NOTA in a laboratory experiment in which an establishment candidate can decide between selfish and fair policy proposals and voters can choose between the establishment candidate and an inefficient protest option.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000039

Employing a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity design that uses administrative roll-out data matched to the government’s poverty census and targeting database in Indonesia, we estimate that the country’s flagship CCT (PKH) reduced child marriages of girls in rural Indonesia by about 3.5 percentage points (about 40 percent).

Incarcerated mothers had babies who were less healthy at birth. This decrease in health represents a shift in the entire birthweight distribution due to exposure to prison camps.

We provide quasi-experimental evidence on the effects of in-person conversations on individual-level polarization outcomes, studying a large-scale intervention in Germany that matched pairs of strangers for private face-to-face meetings to discuss divisive political issues. We find asymmetric effects: conversations with like-minded individuals caused political views to become more extreme (ideological polarization); by contrast, conversations with contrary-minded individuals did not lead to a convergence of political views, but significantly reduced negative beliefs and attitudes toward ideological out-group members (affective polarization), while also improving perceived social cohesion more generally. These effects of contrary-minded conversations seem to be driven mostly by positive experiences of interpersonal contact.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000076

We study how a third party intervenes to manipulate this learning. An attacker and a defender engage in a conflict whose outcome conveys information about the attacker’s strength. A third party worries that the attacker becomes more confident about its military strength and can intervene to help the defender. This intervention is risky: if the attacker wins despite the help the defender receives, its confidence increases even further. We show that optimal third-party intervention is non-monotonic in the attacker’s strength. We also show that a high level of patriotism and resolve to defend itself improve the defender’s odds in the conflict by inducing third-party intervention.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000088

We examine the impact of these relationships on the prescribing of physician-administered cancer drugs in Medicare. We find that prescribing of the associated drug increases 4% in the twelve months after a payment is received, with the increase beginning sharply in the month of payment and fading out within a year. A marketing payment also leads physicians to begin treating cancer patients with lower predicted mortality.

Journal of Public Economics,2025,The environmental costs of political interference: Evidence from power plants in the Amazon,"Francisco Costa, Dimitri Szerman and Juliano Assunção","This paper estimates the impacts of ten recently built hydroelectric power plants in the Brazilian Amazon on deforestation. Using the inventory of all sites with undeveloped hydropower potential, we apply the synthetic control method to estimate the causal impact of each power plant on forest loss. Overall, the construction of the ten plants contributed to 13 percent of the observed forest loss within a 50-kilometer radius of the construction site. Notably, this impact is solely attributed to four plants. In at least three of these plants, construction licenses were granted despite technical recommendations against them. In contrast, the remaining plants, which received technical clearance from the environmental agency, have negligible effects. These findings highlight the effectiveness of robust environmental regulations and underscore their vulnerability to high-level political interference.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272500012X

This rise of the far-right, which is strongly built on the support of the working class, coincides with a sharp decline of the manufacturing sector. This paper analyzes the contribution of this manufacturing decline to the rise of the Austrian far-right. Overall, the decline in manufacturing employment has strongly contributed to this rightward shift in the political landscape, with the manufacturing decline explaining around one-third of the observed increase in far-right vote-shares between 1995 and 2019. Regarding the influences of the forces underlying the manufacturing decline, namely international trade and automation technologies, suggests that both forces contributed in roughly equal parts to this development.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000131

This paper uses a cohort difference-in-differences approach to examine the impact of early-life exposure to air pollution during China’s 1950s industrialization on human capital formation. It assumes that economic opportunities linked to industrial plants impact upwind and downwind counties similarly within a 30-mile radius.

Journal of Public Economics,2025,Populism and ideological convergence: Evidence from a multiparty system,Tuuli Tähtinen,"Populist parties have gained significant power in European politics in the last decades, raising concerns about the potentially contagious effect of populism. I study how populist party representation in local councils affects other parties’ ideological positions. I use variation created by close elections to identify ideological shifts resulting from a change in party representation, holding voter preferences constant. I use candidate-level data from a voting advice application to estimate ideological positions, modeling candidates’ responses using item response theory to obtain measures of ideology that are comparable across election years. The results show that increased populist representation causes the ideological spectrum among other parties’ candidates in the municipality to become more concentrated. One additional seat for the populist party reduces the interquartile range of candidate positions by 9 %. While there is initial ideological convergence between mainstream and populist parties, it does not persist as the populist party continues to gain more seats. These effects take place only on the liberal-conservative dimension, while positions on the economic dimension are unaffected. The results demonstrate that increased populist representation influences other parties and causes ideological convergence within the candidate base.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272400207X
Journal of Public Economics,2025,One hundred years of U.S. state taxation,Sarah Robinson and Alisa Tazhitdinova,"We analyze the evolution of U.S. state tax rates since 1910 and state tax revenues from 1942 until 2022. Tax policy shifted rapidly at the beginning of the 20th century, but in many ways has remained remarkably stable over the past fifty years. Even as tax rates change frequently and vary widely across states, the degree of heterogeneity across states in rates and revenues is very similar over time. We document two key insights for empirical researchers using variation in tax policy for identification. First, tax changes do not appear to be driven by economic conditions, as neither the timing of tax changes nor tax rates themselves exhibit a predictable pattern around state recessions. Second, throughout the time period we study, many tax changes occur simultaneously, particularly for personal, corporate, and sales taxes. Because the coinciding changes are typically moving in the same direction, researchers should use caution when attributing effects to a specific type of tax, and we show that estimates can be sensitive to controlling for additional tax rates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002093

Journal of Public Economics,2025,Where and why do politicians send pork? Evidence from central government transfers to French municipalities,Brice Fabre and Marc Sangnier,"This paper uses French data to simultaneously estimate the impact of two types of connections on government subsidies allocated to municipalities. Investigating different types of connection in a same setting helps to distinguish between the different motivations that could drive pork-barreling. We differentiate between municipalities where ministers held office before their appointment to the government and those where they lived as children. Exploiting ministers’ entries into and exits from the government, we show that municipalities where a minister was mayor receive 30% more investment subsidies when the politician they are linked to joins the government, and a similar size decrease when the minister departs. In contrast, we do not observe these outcomes for municipalities where ministers lived as children. These findings indicate that altruism toward childhood friends and family does not fuel pork-barreling, and suggest that altruism toward adulthood social relations or career concerns matter. We also present complementary evidence suggesting that observed pork-barreling is the result of soft influence of ministers, rather than of their formal control over the administration they lead.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724002123
