AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Black Lives: The High Cost of Segregation,"Robynn Cox, Jamein P. Cunningham, Alberto Ortega and Kenneth Whaley","Exploiting the arrangement of railroad tracks in northern cities, we explore the extent to which segregation impacts homicide victimization by race. Our results reveal a robust positive relationship between segregation and non-White homicide victimization. In addition, we find a decrease in public provisions, as highly segregated locations generate fewer revenues and have lower public expenditures. Our findings suggest that White flight and segregation deplete the local tax base, leading to urban decay and higher crime, resulting in the loss of non-White lives.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220083
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Geographic Variation in Mental Health Treatment Utilization: Evidence from Migration,Hui Ding,"The older population bears a heavy burden of mental illness. Despite the availability of effective treatments, including services (e.g., psychotherapy) and drugs (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics), this paper documents substantial geographic variation in treatment utilization rates among Medicare enrollees. Exploiting patient migration, I show that 45.8 percent of service utilization variation is attributable to place-specific factors, compared to 15.1 percent for drug utilization. Further analyses suggest the role of provider accessibility in explaining the different place effects between service and drug use. Regarding health outcomes, I find that higher treatment utilization is associated with lower risks of self-harm-related emergency department visits.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230402
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Insecurity and Firm Displacement: Evidence from Afghan Corporate Phone Records,"Sylvan Herskowitz, Joshua E. Blumenstock, Tarek Ghani, Ethan B. Kapstein, Thomas L. Scherer and Ott Toomet","We provide empirical evidence on how insecurity affects firm behavior by linking data on deadly terrorist attacks in Afghanistan to geolocated data on corporate mobile phone activity. We first develop an approach to estimate the geographic footprint of firms based on employee locations. Using these measures, our main analysis shows that violent shocks reduce local firm presence by both increasing firm exit and decreasing entry. Firms respond most strongly to violence in their ""headquarters"" districts. We also find suggestive evidence of persistence; stronger impacts in more secure districts; and spillovers, whereby attacks in provincial capitals reduce firm presence in surrounding rural districts.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230295
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Are Complementary Policies Substitutes? Evidence from R&D Subsidies in the United Kingdom,Jacquelyn Pless,"This paper studies whether grants and tax incentives for private R&D are complements or substitutes. I use multiple quasi-experimental research designs to examine firms in the United Kingdom and find that increasing tax credit generosity substantially enhances the effect of grant funding on R&D for small firms, suggesting that the instruments are complements. Financial constraints are likely at play. The effects are strongest for firms that appear constrained, and the combination of policies increases R&D ""entry."" Furthermore, I find that the instruments are substitutes for larger firms, which are usually less constrained. Some alternative explanations can be ruled out.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220356
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Sweeping up Gangs: The Effects of Tough-on-Crime Policies from a Network Approach,Magdalena Domínguez,"Globally, gang proliferation is fought primarily through sweeps. This paper uses a difference-in-differences strategy to examine their causal impact on crime for arrested individuals and their peers. Analysis focuses on the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, which underwent a notable policy shift. Findings reveal significant crime reductions among those arrested and their peers of 85 percent and 31 percent, respectively. Evidence suggests the first stems from incapacitation and the second from less criminal environment. A counterfactual exercise suggests that broader targeting of key players could have reduced crime by 43 percentage points more. This implies network analysis could enhance policy formulation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230467
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Cross-State Strategic Voting,"Gordon B. Dahl, Joseph Engelberg, Runjing Lu and William Mullins","We estimate that 3.1 percent of US voters, or 6.1 million individuals, were registered to vote in two states in 2020, opening up the possibility for them to choose where to vote. Double registrants are concentrated in the wealthiest zip codes and respond to both incentives and costs, disproportionately choosing to vote in swing states (higher incentive) and states that automatically send out mail-in ballots (lower cost). We call this behavior Cross-State Strategic Voting. While others have documented strategic incentives on who to vote for, this paper is the first to consider strategic incentives on where to vote.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20240630
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Plata y Plomo: How Higher Wages Expose Politicians to Criminal Violence,Massimo Pulejo and Pablo Querubín,"What is the effect of politicians' wages on corruption in the presence of criminal groups that use both bribes and violence? With a regression discontinuity design and three distinct proxies for corruption, we show that better-paid Italian politicians are more likely to promote transparency and competition in procurement but also more likely to incur criminal attacks. The effects of wages, which subside after three years, are driven by changes in incumbents' behavior rather than improved selection. These findings show how higher wages may curb corruption, but also foster the use of violence as an alternative tool to influence policymaking.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20240383
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Polling Place Location and the Costs of Voting,"Gaurav Bagwe, Juan Margitic and Allison Stashko","We study how distance to one's polling place affects the likelihood of voting using a geographic regression discontinuity design with data from Pennsylvania and Georgia. A one-mile increase in distance to the polling place reduces the likelihood of voting in person by 1 to 3 percentage points. Effects are two to three times higher among those closest to the polling place. When available, voters substitute to mail-in voting as distance to the polling place increases. In counterfactual exercises, we identify turnout-maximizing polling places. Some precincts have large potential gains in turnout, even when choosing from existing buildings.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220435
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Hacked to Pieces? The Effects of Ransomware Attacks on Hospitals and Patients,"Hannah Neprash, Claire McGlave and Sayeh Nikpay","As cybercriminals increasingly target health care, hospitals face the growing threat of ransomware attacks. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that prevents users from accessing electronic systems and demands a ransom to restore access. We create and link a database of hospital ransomware attacks to Medicare claims data. We quantify the effects of ransomware attacks on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Ransomware attacks decrease hospital volume by 17–24 percent during the initial attack week, with recovery occurring within 3 weeks. Among patients already admitted to the hospital when a ransomware attack begins, in-hospital mortality increases by 34–38 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20240594
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Invisible Wounds: How Mental Disability Benefits Shape Veteran Well-Being,David Silver and Jonathan Zhang,"We study impacts of VA disability compensation on the health and well-being of the large and rapidly growing population of veterans claiming mental disorders. We leverage quasi-random assignment of veterans to medical examiners with varying assessing tendencies. An additional $1,000 per year decreases food insecurity and homelessness by 4.1 and 1.3 percent over 5 years. Health care utilization increases, with greater engagement in preventive care. We estimate precise null average effects on health and mortality. Those on the margin of claim denial experience worse outcomes on average than other applicants, with suggestive evidence of large treatment effects for this subpopulation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230811
AEJ: Economic Policy,2026,Connections during Democratic Transitions: Insights from the Political Purge in Post-WWII France,"Toke S. Aidt, Jean Lacroix and Pierre-Guillaume Méon","We examine how connections shaped transitional justice during France's post-WWII democratic transition. Parliamentarians who had supported the Vichy regime faced a two-stage purge process involving two courts. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that law graduates—an influential group with ties to one of the courts—had a 10 to 14 percentage point higher acquittal rate. We analyze 17,589 documents in individual defendants' files to explain this difference. According to this analysis, indirect connections—connections through third parties—enabled transmission of information to the judges, highlighting how connected elite groups can navigate transitions despite institutional safeguards.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20240411
