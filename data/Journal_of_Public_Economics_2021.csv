Journal of Public Economics,2021,The effect of changes in alcohol tax differentials on alcohol consumption,"Markus Gehrsitz, Henry Saffer and Michael Grossman","We show that tax-induced increases in alcohol prices can lead to substantial substitution and avoidance behavior that limits reductions in alcohol consumption. Causal estimates are derived from a natural experiment in Illinois where spirits and wine taxes were raised sharply and unexpectedly in 2009. Beer taxes were increased by only a trivial amount. We construct representative and consistent measures of alcohol prices and sales from scanner data collected for hundreds of products in thousands of stores across the US. Using several difference-in-differences models, we show that alcohol excise taxes are instantly over-shifted. That is, a $1 tax increase translates into a price increase of up to $1.50. We find evidence suggesting that consumers react by switching to less expensive products. In particular, they increase purchases of beer, thus significantly moderating any tax-induced reductions in total ethanol consumption. Our study highlights the importance of tax-induced substitution, the implications of differential tax increases by beverage group and the impacts on public health of alternative types of tax hikes whose main aims are to increase revenue.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001560
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Firm mobility and jurisdictions’ tax rate choices: Evidence from immobile firm entry,Dominika Langenmayr and Martin Simmler,"Capital mobility is one of the key determinants of corporate tax rates. We first show theoretically that governments will set higher tax rates on firm profits after an immobile firm has entered. We then test this prediction in a well-identified setting, using the rapid growth of wind power plants (a very immobile industry) and the large variation in local business taxes across Germany for identification. We confirm that municipalities increase corporate tax rates by up to 24% after immobile firm entry. The effect is stronger when immobile firms make up a larger share of the overall tax base.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001663
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Carbon taxes and footprint leakage: Spoilsport effects,Carol McAusland,"This paper uses simple variants of Melitz (2003) to illustrate how a unilateral consumption tax can reduce consumption everywhere. The tax—levied on the carbon embodied in consumer goods—reduces demand for dirty goods, lowering the profitability of the global industry. As profitability falls, so does entry, reducing competitive pressure on remaining firms. Less entry and competition translates to fewer varieties and higher average prices for all consumers, including in policy-inactive countries. As a result, a unilateral tax on embodied carbon may reduce the carbon footprint of every country.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001675
Journal of Public Economics,2021,"Institutional flexibility, political alternation, and middle-of-the-road policies","Ascension Andina-Diaz, Francesco Feri and Miguel Meléndez-Jiménez","This paper presents a novel explanation for political alternation in democracies, rooted in the benefit for the median voter of keeping policy from drifting too far to either extreme. Central to this argument is the idea that policy change is gradual and that this gradualism depends on the institutional flexibility/rigidity of the country. Built on this idea, we propose a model of dynamic elections and show that institutional rigidities cause alternation. We also show that, though institutional rigidities prevent governments from implementing extreme policies, they incentivize parties to polarize as much as they can. However, more flexible institutions can foster moderation. Last, we analyze the resilience of equilibrium policies to players’ impatience and discuss extensions of our model, including office-motivated parties, the cost of alternation, alternation every two terms, and asymmetric policies.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001687
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Backlash in policy attitudes after the election of an extreme political party,"Magnus Carlsson, Gordon Dahl and Dan-Olof Rooth","This paper studies how public attitudes towards reduced immigration, the signature policy of the far-right Sweden Democrats, respond once the party increases their political representation at the local level. To identify causal effects, we use panel data from 290 municipal election districts and compare otherwise similar elections where the Sweden Democrats either barely win or lose an additional seat. We estimate that a one seat increase for this far-right, anti-immigration party decreases negative attitudes towards immigration by 1.8 or 4.1 percentage points (depending on which national survey we use), contrary to the party’s policy position. Consistent with these attitudinal changes, we find suggestive evidence the Sweden Democrats lose the incumbency advantage experienced by other small parties in Sweden. Exploring possible mechanisms, we find evidence for higher politician turnover and a rise in negative newspaper coverage. These findings demonstrate that political representation can cause an attitudinal backlash as a fringe party and their ideas are placed under closer scrutiny.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001699

Evidence from a debt reduction intervention,Jeremy Burke,"We conduct the first field experiment examining whether prize-linked incentives can be effective in promoting debt reduction by randomizing access among 6,907 borrowers in a debt management plan. We find strong take-up of the program and that takers were timelier with repayment and paid off more debt. However, average treatment effect estimates for on-time payments, programmatic dropout, and debt levels (46.7 dollars, 95% CI = [−$132, $225], control mean = $11,558) are all precise zeros.

Journal of Public Economics,2021,Thinking outside the box: The cross-border effect of tax cuts on R&D,Thomas Schwab and Maximilian Todtenhaupt,"We analyze how a reduction of the tax rate on corporate income from intellectual property (IP) in one country, known as a patent box regime, affects corporate R&D activity in other countries. Combining data on patents and multinational corporation networks, we show that the cross-border effect of tax policy changes depends on whether co-location of the IP and the underlying R&D activity is required. Patent boxes without such a requirement increase patent output in other countries. Patent boxes with such a requirement reduce patent output abroad but only when relocation costs for R&D activity are small.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001729
Journal of Public Economics,2021,The effects of introducing withholding and third-party reporting on tax collections: Evidence from the U.S. state personal income tax,Sutirtha Bagchi and Libor Dusek,"This paper examines the impact of introducing withholding of the personal income tax by state governments in the U.S. We exploit the staggered adoption of withholding by individual states over the period 1948–1987 to construct event study estimates. We obtain a robust finding: Introducing withholding led to an immediate and permanent increase in income tax revenues by about 29 percent, holding tax rates constant. The result is consistent with the crucial role of withholding and third-party reporting in improving tax compliance. We consider several alternative explanations such as changes to the tax base and increases in enforcement activity but these explanations lack support. There is some evidence that non-filing substantially decreased following the introduction of withholding.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001730

I combine 12 years of administrative records on higher education enrollment and graduation in Chile and exploit the fact that access to state grants for 2-year vocational programs and state loans for 2-year and 4-year vocational programs are both a discontinuous function of a student’s GPA. Both grants and loans increase a student’s probability of ever enrolling in higher education, as well as the number of years that students spend enrolled. Although imprecise, results show a positive effect on graduation. Findings indicate that financial aid can increase degree completion, even when targeted to low-performing students attending vocational education.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001754

This field experiment measures how repeated public praise for the best teachers impacts student performance. In treated schools, the students of praised teachers perform better on standardized exams undertaken six months after the intervention. Praised teachers also assign higher marks to their students two months after the intervention.

We show that even more trades may be simultaneously crowded in. The reason is that, in the absence of complete unravelling, “lemons” fetch more under adverse selection. It is demonstrated how these “bad” trades occur in insurance, credit and used-car markets, and some policy implications are discussed.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001870
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Crowd-out in school-based health interventions: Evidence from India’s midday meals program,"James Berry, Saurabh Mehta, Priya Mukherjee, Hannah Ruebeck and Gauri Shastry","Governments often rely on schools to implement multiple programs targeting child outcomes. How to improve the implementation of these programs is an important, open question. As part of a randomized controlled trial in Odisha, India, we measured the impacts of a nutrition program and a monitoring intervention on the implementation of a pre-existing school-based nutrition program, specifically the Indian government’s iron and folic acid supplementation (IFA) program. The new nutrition intervention distributed a micronutrient mix (MNM) to be added to school meals while the monitoring intervention varied the intensity of monitoring activities. We find that high intensity monitoring improved implementation of the government’s IFA program, while the MNM intervention crowded it out. The net effect is that high intensity monitoring improved child health, while the MNM intervention did not. Both crowd-out of the IFA program and sensitivity to monitoring were predominantly found among schools that were resource or capacity constrained.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001882
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Wealth inequality and the political economy of financial and labour regulations,Ronald Fischer and Diego Huerta,"This article studies the interplay between inequality and the effectiveness of financial and labor regulations. We motivate the paper by observing that the cross-country correlation between wealth inequality and the strength of regulations increases with a country’s GDP per capita. In poor countries the relationship is negative, but might become positive for rich enough countries. In our model, initial regulations and wealth inequality determine occupational choice and thus create endogenous interest groups. We embed these groups in a political economy model, and use it to endogenize political platforms and explain our observation. We show that increased inequality in a poor country leads in equilibrium to lower creditor and worker protection. In rich countries the effect is reversed and higher inequality means that less advantaged groups can exert more pressure towards laws that work in their favour.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001894
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Politics and the distribution of federal funds: Evidence from federal legislation in response to COVID-19,Jeffrey Clemens and Stan Veuger,COVID-19 relief legislation offers a unique setting to study how political representation shapes the distribution of federal assistance to state and local governments. We provide evidence of a substantial small-state bias: an additional Senator or Representative per million residents predicts an additional 670 dollars in aid per capita across the four relief packages. Alignment with the Democratic party predicts increases in states’ allocations through legislation designed after the January 2021 political transition. This benefit of alignment with a unified federal government operates through the American Rescue Plan Act’s size and through the formulas it used to distribute transportation and general relief funds.,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001900

Furthermore, with heterogeneous taxpayers, tax rate variability is shown to perform an efficiency-enhancing screening function, imposing heavier expected tax burdens on less responsive taxpayers. And while efficient tax randomness enables governments to reduce average costs of taxation, it necessarily increases the marginal cost of taxation over some ranges of expected revenue, so may reduce efficient levels of government spending.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000487
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Informative fundraising: The signaling value of seed money and matching gifts,Silvana Krasteva and Piruz Saboury,"While existing theory predicts that matching leadership gifts raise more voluntary contributions for public goods than seed money, recent field experiments find otherwise. We reconcile the two by studying a model of leadership giving with incomplete information about the quality of the public good provided by a charity. Both the fundraising scheme employed by the charity and the contribution decision by the lead donor may signal the charity’s quality to subsequent donors. The charity solicits optimally for a matching gift if the lead donor is informed about the quality of the public good. Intuitively, an informed lead donor conveys quality information to downstream donors through the size of her contribution. As a result, the charity has no signaling concerns and opts for matching because of its ability to mitigate free-riding. The preference for matching, however, reduces when the lead donor’s information is limited. Then, the lead donor’s contribution is less informative and the high quality charity uses seed money as a costly signal of quality. As a result, seed money is associated with higher expected quality and higher expected contributions compared to matching.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001377
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Spot price biases in non-linear health insurance contracts,"Marianne Simonsen, Lars Skipper, Niels Skipper and Anne Illemann Christensen","We study an apparent schism in the literature concerned with non-linear health insurance plans: consumers exposed to the same type of policy appear forward-looking and rational in their response to one policy feature – the end-of-year coverage reset – but not to another – that current prices depend on the year-to-date spending in a non-linear fashion. We exploit policy variation from within a unified institutional environment and uses of population-wide data. We replicate both phenomena empirically: consumers both shift the timing of their purchases in response to the end-of-year reset and react excessively to spot prices during the coverage year. Importantly, however, we show that also the end-of-year behavior is due to over-attention to short-run prices. Specifically, consumers respond entirely to the large and salient change in the spot price in connection with the reset of the coverage year, conditional on the true expected price change. We find that liquidity constraints, rather than plan literacy and cognitive decline are important for understanding the spot price bias.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001444
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Limits to third-party reporting: Evidence from a randomized field experiment in Norway,"Marie Bjørneby, Annette Alstadsæter and Kjetil Telle","Third-party reporting and employers’ tax withholding are powerful compliance mechanisms, as long as the employer and employee do not collude to evade. In cooperation with the Norwegian Tax Administration we designed a randomized field experiment with unannounced on-site audits. Matching audit data to administrative registers, we provide evidence of collusive tax evasion. We find that firms assigned to be audited increased their subsequent wage reporting on behalf of their employees by 18 percent relative to firms assigned to the control group. The effect is more pronounced among small firms with few employees. Our results document limitations of third-party reporting, but also that these limitations can be counteracted by minor on-site audits.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001481

We find that the average government spending multiplier is significantly and persistently above one, driven by a crowding-in of private consumption and non-residential investment. We rationalize the results empirically through a contemporaneously countercyclical response of government spending and an efficient weighting of observations inversely to their error variance. We then show that the multiplier is significantly smaller when volatility is high, consistent with theories predicting reduced effectiveness of fiscal interventions in uncertain times.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001493
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Small business tax compliance under third-party reporting,"Bibek Adhikari, James Alm and Timothy F. Harris","How does third-party income reporting affect tax compliance? We use confidential administrative data from tax returns and information reports to estimate the impact of third-party income reporting on small business tax compliance. Since 2011, payment settlement entities (e.g., American Express) were required to report payment card transactions to both the firm and the Internal Revenue Service using Form 1099-K. This requirement made businesses’ receipts from payment cards—but not their cash receipts—third-party reported. Consequently, businesses located in higher payment card use areas experienced greater levels of third-party reporting than businesses located in lower credit card use areas. We construct an index of payment card use at the commuting zone level, and we use this variation to identify the effect of Form 1099-K on reported receipts and deductions by small businesses. Overall, we find that the legislation modestly increased reported receipts without significantly increasing deductions. We also find substantial heterogeneity, with smaller firms, firms in business-to-consumer industries, and partnerships reporting a relatively large increase in receipts and a partially offsetting increase in deductions, implying a modest increase in tax compliance.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272100150X
Journal of Public Economics,2021,More birds than stones – A framework for second-best energy and climate policy adjustments,"Carolyn Fischer, Michael Hübler and Oliver Schenker","A well-known principle in public economics states that at least as many policy instruments as market failures are required to achieve an efficient outcome. In practice, however, regulatory power is often constrained, making implementing the first-best policy portfolio difficult or impossible. We analyze analytically and numerically how available policy instruments should be adjusted vis-à-vis the first-best to account for under-internalized secondary market failures. Consider, for example, the power sector: alongside the external costs of emissions, evidence suggests that consumers undervalue energy efficiency investments, and knowledge spillovers hamper research and development (R&D) and learning-by-doing in low-carbon technologies. By exploring the potential and limits of policy instrument substitution, we provide suggestions for adjusting policies in second-best situations. We calibrate the theoretical model to the European electricity sector and find that, compared with the first-best policy portfolio, relying on carbon dioxide (CO2) pricing alone increases the policy cost of the EU CO2 emissions target by about 30%. Uninternalized R&D spillovers contribute the most to this increase, and are the most difficult to address indirectly, even with subsidies supporting learning-by-doing. By contrast, almost 40% of the additional cost created by the absence of optimal energy efficiency subsidies can be recuperated by a second-best electricity tax.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001511

Using recently released census data covering the entire population, we exploit variation at the newly created age-based eligibility threshold. Our results show a considerable and abrupt decline in labor force participation of 6.0 percentage points (13%) when older workers reach the eligibility age of 70. To mitigate the impact of population aging today, pension reforms aimed at increasing elderly labor supply, however, have to induce much larger behavioral responses than the OPA.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001523

Exploiting salary-dependent cutoffs governing documentation requirements when claiming deductions for charitable contributions in Cyprus, we estimate that deductions increase by £0.7 when taxpayers can claim £1 more without documentation. Second, using a retroactive reform we find that at least 64% of the response is purely a reporting adjustment representing mainly over-reporting of deductions.

Journal of Public Economics,2021,Environmental regulations and international trade: A quantitative economic analysis of world pollution emissions,"Yuwan Duan, Ting Ji, Yi Lu and Siying Wang","We develop and quantitatively evaluate a general equilibrium trade model with pollution as a byproduct of production to study the interactions between international trade, the environment, and environmental regulations. Our analysis suggests that environmental regulations provide a source of comparative advantage, but we fail to find evidence that reducing trade barriers causes pollution-intensive industries to concentrate in countries with weak environmental regulation stringency. The reason is that as a crucial determinant of pollution emissions and abatement, environmental regulations are weak in determining international specializations. By comparing environmental regulation stringency with other determinants of international trade, we identify productivity and trade costs as being the major forces that suppress the influence of environmental regulations on deciding international production and trade. Furthermore, we incorporate endogenous environmental policy into our framework and explore how environmental policy responds to trade liberalization. We allow for strategic environmental policy, but find its use as a substitute for tariffs to be quite limited. We also evaluate various forces that determine the overall impacts of international trade on worldwide pollution emissions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001572

We conducted an experiment to evaluate the impact of an outreach campaign that prompted loan applicants at a large community college to make informed and active borrowing decisions. The intervention led students to reduce their unsubsidized loan borrowing by 7 percent. This resulted in worse academic performance, and increased the likelihood of loan default during the five years after the intervention occurred.

We show that this finding is not the result of selection into neighborhoods or of place-based factors that determine turnout, but rather peer effects. Consistent with this claim, we find a contagion effect for non-movers and show that neighbors from the same block are much more likely to perform an electoral procedure on the same exact day as neighbors who live on different blocks within a neighborhood.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001316

Rarely is the latter observed. We use novel micro-level data on on-road fuel consumption and fuel prices in Japan to estimate both the contemporaneous and dynamic effects of gasoline prices on on-road fuel economy. Our estimate of the contemporaneous price elasticity of on-road fuel economy is approximately 0.07, suggesting that approximately 19% of the price elasticity of gasoline consumption comes from improvements in fuel-conserving behavior. We also find limited habit formation of fuel economy changes; fuel economy effectively responds only to current gasoline prices.

Populist politicians prefer a bureaucrat who implements their policy commitment, while non-populist politicians prefer a good bureaucrat with discretion. The presence of populist politicians thus determines replacement of good with bad bureaucrats and creates incentives for good bureaucrats to “feign loyalty”. We show that feigning loyalty is more prevalent when the probability of populist leadership in the future is higher and the bureaucrats’ pool of potential replacements is worse. We also show that bureaucratic turnover is higher under populists when the bureaucracy is strong and higher under non-populists when the bureaucracy is weak.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272100133X

Little is known about the extent to which unintended consequences from the early announcement of a policy can be larger than the implementation effect, especially in contexts of weak state capacity. We use detailed 1 km grid square data on coca cultivation to estimate the net effect of the announcement and implementation of coca crop substitution payments in Colombia. Our fine-grain data also enable us to estimate geographical spillovers of the program to non-targeted neighboring areas. Using a difference-in-differences empirical strategy, we find that program recipients reduced coca acreage. Surprisingly, the reduction in neighboring grid areas is of a similar magnitude. However, the effectiveness was reduced by half, because farmers increased coca cultivation in order to be eligible for the program after the announcement and before implementation. But the policy’s net effect is negative: due to weak state capacity, the program could not be implemented in every region of the country.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001341

Journal of Public Economics,2021,The welfare effects of extending unemployment benefits: Evidence from re-employment and unemployment transfers,Po-Chun Huang and Tzu-Ting Yang,"This paper investigates the welfare effects of extending unemployment benefits by comparing the search effort responses to income transfers when employed (i.e. re-employment bonus) and unemployed (i.e. extended benefits). Specifically, we use administrative data on the universe of unemployment spells in Taiwan from 2001 to 2011 and evaluate effects of providing a re-employment bonus and extending unemployment benefits. Our results suggest that the provision of re-employment bonus increases job-finding hazards and results in the positive fiscal externality. The behavioral costs per New Taiwanese Dollar (NTD) of initial spending on bonuses is -0.61. In contrast, extending unemployment benefits reduces the rate of unemployment exit and generates the negative fiscal externality. We integrate the estimated policy effects with a search model with liquidity constraints to identify the value of extending unemployment benefits captured by the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between consumption when unemployed and employed. We find that the estimated MRS of extending benefits is around 1.5 to 2.5 — the marginal value of transfers when unemployed is about two times larger than that when employed. Finally, the marginal value of public fund for extending UI benefits is between 1.3 and 2, suggesting the welfare gain from benefit extension is larger than its welfare cost by more than 30%.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001365

Using a difference-in-differences design to compare survivors to a matched control group, we find that in the short run children who survive have substantially lower GPA (nearly 0.5 SD) and increased utilization of health care services and more mental health diagnoses. In the medium run, survivors have fewer years of schooling completed and lower labor force participation.

Journal of Public Economics,2021,Incumbents’ performance and political extremism,Marina Dodlova and Galina Zudenkova,"This paper studies the relationship between incumbents’ performance and political extremism, both with theory and data. The theory is based on a spatial model of political competition in which voters use the incumbent’s performance in office to update their beliefs about his competence. A better performance leads to the incumbent’s electoral advantage and so allows him to announce a more extreme platform closer to his bliss point. His challenger, in turn, faces electoral disadvantage and so announces a more moderate platform in order to compensate for it. To test these predictions, we use the data on incumbents’ performance in natural disaster relief and ideological positions of the candidates in the U.S. House of Representatives elections for the time period 2000–2012. The empirical evidence shows that a better performance in post-disaster recovery is associated with more extreme ideological positions of the corresponding incumbents and more moderate ideological positions of their challengers. These and other empirical results are in line with the model predictions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001092
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Failure to launch: Measuring the impact of sales tax nexus standards on business activity,Richard Beem and Donald Bruce,"We present the first empirical analysis of the relationship between sales tax collection obligations, or nexus, and business activity. The recent Supreme Court decision in the Wayfair case upended the long-standing physical presence requirement for sales tax nexus, and opened the door for states to enforce sales tax collection obligations on remote sellers that have sufficient economic presence in the buyer’s state. In an effort to inform the ongoing policy discussion, we make use of state-level panel data to explore the extent to which changes in sales tax nexus were associated with changes in firm activity between 1979 and 2014. Our results suggest that increasing sales tax base breadth by 1 percentage point generates 0.14 percent additional firms and establishments and 0.2 percent higher employment levels. Furthermore, increasing the share of online companies with nexus by 1 percentage point translates into 0.1 percent additional (small) firms as the sales-tax-collection obligation is dispersed among a larger share of firms. Results from a simulation show that unwinding half of the observed base narrowing could have generated as many as 90,350 firms, 113,600 establishments, and 2.9 million jobs during the time period. These results provide suggestive evidence of the future impact of sales tax base recovery that will result from more neutral nexus standards in the post-Wayfair world.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001122

This paper explores how selection procedures influence the quality of selected officials in the context of U.S. state supreme courts for the years 1947–1994. In a unique set of natural experiments, state governments enacted a variety of reforms making judicial elections less partisan and establishing merit-based procedures that delegate selection to experts. We compare post-reform judges to pre-reform judges in their work quality, measured by forward citations to their opinions. In this setting we can hold constant contemporaneous incentives and the portfolio of cases, allowing us to produce causal estimates under an identification assumption of parallel trends in quality by judge starting year. We find that judges selected by nonpartisan processes (nonpartisan elections or technocratic merit commissions) produce higher-quality work than judges selected by partisan elections. These results are consistent with a representative voter model in which better technocrats are selected when the process has less partisan bias or better information regarding candidate ability.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001146
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Individual vs. group decision-making: Evidence from a natural experiment in arbitration proceedings,Naomi Gershoni,"The importance of understanding the systematic differences between group and individual decisions has been well recognized in the literature. However, the vast majority of empirical evidence on this issue is derived from laboratory experiments, and hence does not reflect professional incentives and career concerns, both of which may play a crucial role. To fill this gap, I exploit a unique regulatory change that exogenously decreased the number of presiding arbitrators from three to one for a specific class of cases in the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration and an original data set of arbitration awards. The findings indicate that panels of three arbitrators render more extreme “all or nothing” awards compared to sole arbitrators. An arbitrator fixed effects model confirms that this tendency is also present within arbitrators, thus ruling out that the effect is driven by differential selection of arbitrators into panels. Rather, evidence suggests that groups provide individual arbitrators with a “shield of anonymity” which mitigates their concerns about adverse reputational effects of extreme decisions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001158

We cannot reject that consumers respond to lifetime energy costs in the same way they respond to purchase prices under a wide range of assumptions. These findings run counter to the popular wisdom, which motivates energy standards, that energy costs are systematically undervalued due to various behavioral phenomena.

Journal of Public Economics,2021,The economics of religious communities,Jean-Paul Carvalho and Michael Sacks,"The religious club model is central to the economics of religion. To expand its scope for application, we develop the first model to combine (i) increasing returns to membership, (ii) discrimination, and (iii) religious competition. Any degree of non-rivalry in religious club goods introduces scale effects which require new analytical techniques. Due to increasing returns, a religious leader faces a trade-off between forming a large inclusive club and screening out less committed types to form a small strict club. Endogenous screening makes religious strictness a non-monotonic function of economic development, which is consistent with the emergence of strict sects following periods of liberalization and economic growth. Blanket discrimination against all community members makes the religious community stricter and more cohesive, explaining the survival of religious sects and minorities under persecution. Stigmatizing actively religious members promotes social integration on the whole, but can create an extreme isolationist sect. Contrary to prior work on religious markets, we uncover a mechanism by which religious competition reduces religious participation and boosts social integration. Thus, attempts to moderate religion by stigmatizing participation and restricting competition could backfire. Finally, our model provides guidance for empirical work on religious discrimination and further extensions of the religious club model.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001171

When permits are politically allocated, Congress selects a cap both for the external benefits it provides as well as the private green pork, or value of permits, it generates. Legislative bargaining in contexts when public and private goods are co-produced, such as climate change, induces trade-offs between policy passage and conditional efficiency and equity. Moreover, lowering the vote threshold or originating climate policy in the Senate results in a policy that is more vulnerable to unanticipated deviations in the winning coalition.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001195

The Ramsey government internalizes the general equilibrium effects of private precautionary saving on factor prices and taxes capital unless the weight on future generations in the social welfare function is sufficiently high. For logarithmic utility a complete analytical solution of the Ramsey problem exhibits an optimal aggregate saving rate that is independent of income risk, whereas the optimal time-invariant tax on capital implementing this saving rate is increasing in income risk. The optimal saving rate is constant along the transition and its sign depends on the magnitude of risk and on the Pareto weight of future generations. If the Ramsey tax rate that maximizes steady state utility is positive, then implementing this tax rate permanently induces a Pareto-improving transition even if the initial equilibrium capital stock is below the golden rule.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001274

One important challenge is imperfect information about individuals’ contributions. In laboratory experiments, imperfect information increases misdirected punishment and thereby hampers the efficacy of the punishment mechanism. A key question is thus whether those facing such a collective action dilemma would punish despite doubt if they could observe one another’s actions more accurately at some cost. We find that most experimental subjects prefer to engage in costly monitoring before punishing, or else not to punish at all. We demonstrate a price sensitive demand for monitoring, a tendency of known monitoring to serve as a warning of punishment, a taste-based preference for full over partial monitoring, and positive effects of monitoring on cooperation and efficiency.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000657

The main technical hurdle in developing this theory is the possibility that individuals have multiple optimal incomes. Using a perturbation approach, we derive optimal tax formulas that account for the possibility that individuals have multiple optima and, hence, account for the possibility that individuals jump between their optimal income levels when we perturb the tax schedule. We quantify the magnitude of these effects, thereby augmenting the optimal tax formulas from Saez (2001) with additional “jumping effect” terms. We provide a partial characterization of when individuals with multiple optimal incomes may exist under the optimal tax schedule. Finally, we derive a new methodology to simulate optimal income tax schedules with multidimensional heterogeneity. We implement this method numerically, showing that individuals with multiple optimal income levels can exist under the optimal tax schedule.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000785

We find that students who are assigned to an early morning (7:30 AM) section of a general education course are roughly 10% less likely to major in that subject, relative to students assigned to a later time slot for the course. We find similar effects for fatigue generated by having one or more back-to-back courses immediately prior to a general education course that starts later in the day.

The behavioral effects of birthright citizenship on immigrant youth","Christina Felfe, Martin Kocher, Helmut Rainer, Judith Saurer and Thomas Siedler","Inequality of opportunity, particularly when overlaid with socioeconomic, ethnic, or cultural differences, may limit the scope of cooperation between individuals. A central question, then, is how to overcome such obstacles to cooperation. We study this question in the context of Germany, by asking whether the propensity of immigrant youth to cooperate with native peers was affected by a major integration reform: the introduction of birthright citizenship. Our unique setup exploits data from a large-scale lab-in-the-field experiment in a quasi-experimental evaluation framework. We find that the policy caused male, but not female, immigrants to significantly increase their cooperativeness toward natives. We show that the increase in out-group cooperation among immigrant boys is an outcome of more trust rather than a reflection of stronger other-regarding preferences towards natives. In exploring factors that may explain these behavioral effects, we present evidence that the policy also led to a near-closure of the educational achievement gap between young immigrant men and their native peers. Our results highlight that, through integration interventions, governments can modify prosocial behavior in a way that generates higher levels of efficiency in the interaction between social groups.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000840

By focusing on multi-member plurality elections, we identify the effect of rank amongst politicians that hold the same office and received a similar number of votes. To identify the causal effect of rank, we conduct a close-elections RD at the village, municipality, and province levels. Our main result is the first place effect: incumbent first placers are 5–9% (1–4%) more likely to run (win) in future elections than incumbent second placers. The first place effect is unique among rank effects: subsequent rank comparisons yield substantially weaker or insignificant results. Further evidence suggests that a variety of potential mechanisms—party alignment, strategic voting, differential levels of media exposure or the better performance of first placers—do not seem to explain our results.

Within the employed, we find significant differences in flu incidence by occupation (e.g., sales occupations show 40.5% higher probability of infection than farmers) and by industry (e.g., education, health and social services show 52.2% higher probability of infection than mining). Further, we show that the interaction between occupations and industries is important to understand contagion. Indeed, cross-industry differences in flu incidence cannot be fully explained by differences in the within-industry occupation structure. As a potential mechanism for contagion, we study how flu incidence varies with the extent of human contact interaction at work—with an occupation-industry-specific score that we construct based on O’NET occupational characteristics.

We argue that parties can solve this moral hazard problem by committing ex ante to allocate higher offices in government, such as cabinet portfolios, monotonically with list rank. Under this schedule of compensation, parties have incentives to rank candidates in order of quality (under some conditions) and candidates have incentives to increase the volume and geo-diversity of their campaign efforts as their rank improves. Using detailed data on Norwegian candidates and their use of mass and social media in recent elections, we confirm that (1) candidate quality increases with list rank, and (2) candidates in safer ranks shift from intra-district to extra-district and national media exposure—a composition of effort that can increase their party’s chance of entering government, and thus their own potential share of the spoils.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000931

First, drawing on additional years of data, this paper then documents that the longer-run effects during the reform are twice as large as the medium-run effects. Second, we document novel labor-demand-driven “hysteresis” from this policy – i.e. persistent employment effects even after the subsidy no longer applies – along two dimensions. Over the lifecycle, employment effects persist even after workers age out of eligibility. Three years after the repeal, employment remains elevated at the maximal reform level in the formerly subsidized ages. These hysteresis effects more than double the direct employment effects of the reform.

We apply a novel approach to identify individual-level consumption within a collective household model and use the structural estimates to compute poverty rates separately for women, men, boys, girls, and the elderly. We find that women (especially older women) and children (later-born children in particular) face significant probabilities of living in poverty even in households with per-capita expenditure above the poverty line.

We show that the carbon emission trading system (ETS) has no effect on changing coal efficiency of regulated coal-fired power plants. Although we find a significant reduction in coal consumption associated with ETS participation, this reduction was achieved by reducing electricity production. The output contraction in the treated plants is not due to their optimizing behavior but is likely driven by government decisions, because the impacts of emission permits on marginal costs are small relative to the controlled electricity prices and the reduction is associated with financial losses. In addition, we find no evidence of carbon leakage to other provinces, but a significant increase in the production of non-coal-fired power plants in the ETS regions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001067

Theory predicts that FPUC should decrease job applications, while the effect on vacancy creation is ambiguous. We estimate the effect of FPUC on job applications and vacancy creation week by week, from March to July 2020, using granular data from the online jobs platform Glassdoor. We exploit variation in the proportional increase in benefits across local labor markets. To isolate the effect of FPUC, we flexibly allow for different trends in local labor markets differentially exposed to the COVID-19 crisis. We verify that trends in outcomes prior to the FPUC do not correlate with future increases in benefits, which supports our identification assumption. First, we find that a 10% increase in unemployment benefits caused a 3.6% decline in applications, but did not decrease vacancy creation; hence, FPUC increased labor market tightness (vacancies/applications). Second, we document that tightness was unusually depressed during the FPUC period. Altogether, our results imply that the positive effect of FPUC on tightness was likely welfare improving: FPUC decreased competition among applicants at a time when jobs were unusually scarce. Our results also help explain prior findings that FPUC did not decrease employment.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001079

We use two regional payroll tax cuts in Finland as well as the onset of the Great Recession to estimate the effect of the recession on firms treated by the payroll tax cuts compared to a similar control group. When implemented, prior to the Great Recession, we estimate that the payroll tax cuts had limited effects on employment and balance-sheet outcomes of firms located in the treated regions. However, when the recession starts, some of its negative effects were substantially hampered by the previously enacted payroll tax cuts in treated firms. These employment effects are exacerbated for men and low-skilled employees. We also find that sales and profits in treated firms respond differently in treated firms during the recession. We provide some evidence showing that firms that are liquidity constrained are the ones that exhibit the strongest response. This shows that payroll tax cuts can make firms more resilient during downturns, possibly by relaxing liquidity constraints.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721001080

We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in rural Guinea Bissau to understand the effectiveness and cost of concerted supply-based interventions in such contexts. Our intervention created simple schools offering four years of education to primary-school aged children in lieu of the government. At endline, children receiving the intervention scored 58.1 percentage points better than controls on early grade reading and math tests, demonstrating that the intervention taught children to read and perform basic arithmetic, from a counterfactual condition of very high illiteracy. Our results provide evidence that particularly needy areas may require more concerted, dramatic interventions in education than those usually considered, but that such interventions hold great potential for increasing education levels among the world’s poorest people.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000219
Journal of Public Economics,2021,The effect of course shutouts on community college students: Evidence from waitlist cutoffs,"Silvia Robles, Max Gross and Robert Fairlie","One frequently cited yet understudied channel through which funding levels impact college students is course availability—colleges are often forced to respond to budgetary pressure by reducing course offerings. We provide the first causal evidence on this mechanism at a community college, using administrative course registration data and a novel research design that exploits discontinuities in course admissions created by waitlists. Community colleges enroll about half of U.S. undergraduates and over half of minority students in public colleges. The impacts of course availability in this setting may be especially salient relative to four-year colleges due to open admissions policies, binding class size constraints, and a heavy reliance on state funding. Across a range of bandwidths, we find that students stuck on a waitlist and shut out of a course section were 22–28 percent more likely to take zero courses that term relative to a baseline of about 10 percent. Shutouts also increased transfer rates to nearby, but potentially less-desirable two-year colleges. These results offer some evidence that course availability can disrupt community college students’ educational trajectories.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000451

Exploiting variation in the severity and timing of the recession across states, we estimate the effect of unemployment on SSDI applications and awards. We find the Great Recession induced nearly one million SSDI applications that otherwise would not have been filed, of which 41.8% were awarded benefits, resulting in over 400,000 new beneficiaries who made up 8.9% of all SSDI entrants between 2008 and 2012. More than one-half of the recession-induced awards were made on appeal. The induced applicants had less severe impairments than the average applicant. Only 9% had the most severe, automatically-qualifying impairments, 33% had functional impairments and no transferable skills, and the rest were denied for having insufficiently severe impairments and/or transferable skills. Our estimates imply the Great Recession increased claims processing costs by $2.960 billion during 2008–2012, and SSDI benefit obligations by $55.730 billion in present value, or $97.365 billion including both SSDI and Medicare benefits.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000463
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Who pays for and who benefits from minimum wage increases? Evidence from Israeli tax data on business owners and workers,"Lev Drucker, Katya Mazirov and David Neumark","A key goal of a higher minimum wage is income redistribution towards low-income families. Existing research on the minimum wage focuses on the impact on affected workers, but is silent on the incomes of the owners of businesses who pay for a higher minimum wage. Higher minimum wages will do more to redistribute income if the owners of businesses who pay the minimum wage are nearer the top of the income distribution, and vice versa. We study evidence on the incidence of the minimum wage on the incomes of business owners using a unique administrative dataset on the universe of tax records for Israel, in the period surrounding a large minimum wage increase. We find that the minimum wage hike reduced profits of companies, with minimum-wage intensive companies bearing the bulk of the cost and adjusting their workforces more aggressively. Notably, profits declined more for lower-income business owners. Moreover, owners of businesses with higher shares of minimum-wage workers ranked at the bottom of the income distribution of business owners. In addition, spouses of business owners earn less than the owners while minimum wage workers have higher earning spouses, further reducing the redistributive effect of the minimum wage.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000591
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Quid pro quo? Government-firm relationships in China,Yu-Hsiang Lei,"This paper studies favor exchange between governments and firms in China by exploiting a quasi-experiment tax reform. A tax revenue-sharing rule between central and local governments was announced in October 2001: the higher the local tax revenue in 2001, the higher the share of the tax revenue that stays at local afterward. I find that local governments that granted more favors to firms before the reform received more assistance from firms to raise the tax revenue in 2001; in turn, an abnormally high government subsidy was returned to firms that offered assistance. This paper demonstrates that a reciprocal relationship between governments and firms beyond the simple trading of personal favors could arise in non-democratic societies where politicians face no electoral incentives. The fact that firms and governments could mutually benefit from this reciprocal relationship helps explain the exceptional economic growth in China despite its unfavorable business environment.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000633

Journal of Public Economics,2021,The informational value of environmental taxes,Stefan Ambec and Jessica Coria,"We propose informational spillovers as a new rationale for the use of multiple policy instruments to mitigate a single externality. We investigate the design of a pollution standard when the firms’ abatement costs are unknown and emissions are taxed. A firm might abate pollution beyond what is required by the standard by equalizing its marginal abatement costs to the tax rate, thereby revealing information about its abatement cost. We analyze how a regulator can take advantage of this information to design the standard. In a dynamic setting, the regulator relaxes the initial standard in order to induce more information revelation, which would allow her to set a standard closer to the first best in the future. Updating standards, though, generates a ratchet effect since a low-cost firm might strategically hide its cost by abating no more than required by the standard. We characterize the optimal standard and its update across time depending on the firm’s abatement strategy. We illustrate our theoretical results with the case of NOx regulation in Sweden. We find evidence that the firms that pay the NOx tax experience more frequent standard updates and more stringent revisions than those who are exempted.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272100075X

We use two similar but distinct identification strategies that address potential endogeneity due to time-varying student-level shocks by exploiting within-student, between-subject variation in class-specific absences. We also leverage information on the timing of absences to show that absences that occur after the annual window for state standardized testing do not affect test scores, providing a further check of our identification strategy. Both approaches yield similar results. We find that absences in middle and high school harm contemporaneous student achievement and longer-term educational attainment: On average, missing 10 classes reduces math or English Language Arts test scores by 3–4% of a standard deviation and course grades by 17–18% of a standard deviation. 10 total absences across all subjects in 9th grade reduce both the probability of on-time graduation and ever enrolling in college by 2%.

Using rich population register data among women aged 20–44 who own a home, we find that for each 100,000 DKK increase in home prices (equivalent to $12,000), the likelihood of giving birth increases by 0.27 percentage points or 2.35%. These estimates are similar to findings from the US per dollar of home price change, which is surprising given the strong pro-natalist policies and generous government programs in Denmark. We also present the first estimates of the effect of home prices on infant health. Our findings indicate that housing price increases lead to better child health at birth in terms of low birth weight and prematurity, however most of these effects reflect changes in the composition of births. There is no evidence of an effect on health during the first five years of life.

In this context, leaders have faced a trade-off between imposing stringent measures to limit the contagion, and minimizing the short-run costs on their national economy, which could impact their electoral prospects. Leveraging on both the timing of elections and the constitutional term limits faced by leaders in presidential systems, we document how incumbents who can run for re-election implement less stringent restrictions when the election is closer in time. The effect is driven by measures more likely to have a negative economic impact.

With charitable giving, the social rewards from giving can begin being enjoyed the moment a decision to give has been made. Later, when the gift is transacted, the donor can again experience utility from giving and seeing their donations at work. We show both theoretically and experimentally that these early flows of social utility can generate time inconsistent charitable giving. A fundraiser can get more donations (50 percent more in our Experiment 1) by allowing a donor to decide now to give later.

Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the closed-list system increases the share of women among candidates, councilors, and mayors, by 4.1, 4.8, and 7.1 percentage points, respectively.

Journal of Public Economics,2021,Sharing the burden of subsidization: Evidence on pass-through from a subsidy revision in Medicare Part D,Colleen Carey,"In many federally-subsidized insurance markets, insurers are subsidized on the basis of enrollee characteristics; in principle, subsidies that are “risk adjusted” in this way compensate insurers for ex ante differences in expected cost. Between 2010 and 2011, the subsidies in Medicare Part D were revised, sharply changing the subsidy for diagnoses and demographic characteristics. This paper uses the response of insurers to the subsidy update to estimate pass-through of government subsidies to two insurer choice variables: premiums and out-of-pocket costs. We find that diagnostic subsidies are passed-through at a rate of 40% to the out-of-pocket costs for relevant drugs.

Linking the permit markets of different countries will turn permit issuance into intertemporal strategic complements.

Hence, each country faces incentives to withhold emission permits when permit markets are linked.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000426

The literature suggests compensating them via Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) pensions as a possible solution. We carry out the optimal policy exercise of a utilitarian government in a dynamically efficient economy with pension and education support obeying the Pareto criterion. We find that expansion of one instrument along with the other emerges as the optimal response, however, once the complete market level of education is achieved, the optimal policy suggests phasing pensions out. Eventually, government leads the economy to an equilibrium with zero pension and the Golden Rule level of education. This is achieved by exploiting only market opportunities without relying on other factors including human capital externalities, general equilibrium effects, or socio-political factors. We complement our theoretical results with a numerical exercise and compute the optimal policy path under different initial conditions and parameter values.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000475

It first demonstrates that differential capital tax, based on capital’s effect on skill premiums, is desirable even in the steady state, while nonlinear capital tax is not desirable under an additively separable utility function. It then explores both uniform and sector-specific capital income tax (UCIT and SCIT), with a sector corresponding to a type of laborer. Numerical application to U.S. taxation delivers an inverted U-shaped relationship between the SCIT rate and sectoral wage. The optimal SCIT rate on the top-income sectors increases with the elasticity of substitution between the sectoral products and amounts to a net return tax of 45.9%. Reform from UCIT to SCIT compresses wage gaps between the top ten percent and others considerably. It especially favors the median-income individuals whose wages are increased as high as 3.8%. Due to production inefficiency, switching from UCIT to SCIT implies small welfare gains (0.07%~0.22% in consumption-equivalent terms).",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000578

These individuals were publicly recognized and awarded the construction of a sidewalk.

The staggered timing of summer breaks across federal states allows us to implement an event study design. We base our analysis on official daily counts of confirmed coronavirus infections by age groups across all 401 German counties. We consider an event window of two weeks before and four weeks after the end of summer breaks. We do not find evidence of a positive effect of school re-openings on case numbers. For individuals aged between 5 and 59 years, comprising school-aged children and their parents, our preferred specification indicates that the end of summer breaks had a negative but insignificant effect on the number of new confirmed cases. Our results are not explained by changes in mobility patterns around school re-openings arising from travel returnees.

Using a novel panel of administrative tax data from China and exploiting China’s progressive monthly wage income tax schedule and a tax reform in 2011, we document two key differences in the ETI estimates obtained from these two approaches. First, the tax reform ETI estimates increase concavely over time, while the bunching ETI estimates are much more stable. Second, the tax reform ETI estimates (around 4 in the long-run) are much larger than the bunching ETI (around 0.5), and the difference is statistically significant. To account for these facts, we develop a simple model where individuals in each period have some probability to permanently change hours of work without paying other costs but can temporarily adjust hours by paying additional costs. With stable wage rates, the two estimators should converge to the same underlying value. But with normal wage growth, the tax reform estimates converge to the true underlying parameter, whereas the bunching estimates can be far below the true figure.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000116

Step 1: estimate individual transition hazards across employment, temporary layoff, permanent layoff, quitter, entrant, and out of the labor force, with each hazard depending on an aggregate component as well as an individual’s labor force history. Step 2: relate the aggregate components to the overall unemployment rate using a factor model. Step 3: combine the individual duration dependence, factor structure, and an auxiliary forecast of the unemployment rate to simulate a panel of individual labor force histories. Applying our approach to the November Blue Chip forecast of the COVID-19 recession, we project that 750,000 workers laid off in April 2020 remain unemployed eight months later. Total long-term unemployment rises thereafter and eventually reaches 4.2 million individuals unemployed for more than 26 weeks and 1.4 million individuals unemployed for more than 46 weeks. Long-term unemployment rises even more in a more pessimistic recovery scenario, but remains below the level in the Great Recession due to a high amount of labor market churn.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000347

Next, we examine five case studies of major drugs going off patent.

Journal of Public Economics,2021,Too family friendly? The consequences of parent part-time working rights,Daniel Fernández-Kranz and Núria Rodriguez-Planas,"We use a difference-in-differences model with individual fixed effects to evaluate a 1999 Spanish law granting employment protection to workers with children younger than 6 who had asked for a shorter workweek due to family responsibilities. Our analysis shows that well-intended policies can potentially backfire and aggravate labor market inequalities between men and women, since there is a very gendered take-up, with only women typically requesting part-time work. After the law was enacted, employers were 49% less likely to hire women of childbearing age, 40% more likely to separate from them, and 37% less likely to promote them to permanent contracts, increasing female non-employment by 4% to 8% relative to men of similar age. The results are similar using older women unaffected by the law as a comparison group. Moreover, the law penalized all women of childbearing age, even those who did not have children. These effects were largest in low-skill jobs, at firms with less than 10 employees, and in industries with few part-time workers. These findings are robust to several sensitivity analyses and placebo tests.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000438
Journal of Public Economics,2021,The urban crime and heat gradient in high and low poverty areas,"Kilian Heilmann, Matthew Kahn and Cheng Tang","Using spatially disaggregated daily crime data for the City of Los Angeles, this paper estimates the impact of ambient temperature on crime, and how this relationship varies across neighborhoods. Our estimates suggest that, relative to cooler days, overall crime rates are 1.72% and 1.90% higher when daily maximum temperature exceeds 75 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit respectively. This heat-crime relationship is much stronger in low-income neighborhoods, and is largely driven by non-pecuniary crimes of passion, such as domestic crimes and crimes against intimate partners. Using internal policing data, we find that the surge in crime is not a result of reduced policing effort in low-income areas during hot days. Instead, we document that characteristics of the built environment such as housing age and urban greenery are highly correlated with the slope of the heat-crime relationship. Our estimates suggest that the monetary cost of heat-induced crime incurred by the highest poverty neighborhoods is five times larger than that incurred by more affluent areas, highlighting the starkly differential impact of extreme weather even over small geographies within cities.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272100044X

We investigate this question using an incentivized online experiment with 1900 US respondents in early April 2020. We present all participants with the latest CDC projection about coronavirus death counts. We randomize exposure to information that highlights how President Trump previously downplayed the coronavirus threat. When the President’s inconsistency is salient, participants are less likely to revise their prior beliefs about death counts from the projection. They also report lower trust in the government.

This reform, which induced kibbutz students to improve their high-school academic performance, spilled over to their non-kibbutz peers who attended the same schools. In the short run, the peers improved their high-school outcomes and shifted to courses with higher financial returns.

Further, public firms dedicate 7.4 percentage points more of their investments to R&D than private firms.

Yet, little is known about access to elite education and its labor market implications in China, a country that produces one in every five college graduates in the world. College admission in China is governed by a single exam – the national college entrance exam, and the government sets admission cutoff scores for elite colleges. We examine the impacts of scoring above the elite-tier cutoff on a student’s access to elite colleges and wage outcomes after graduation, using the discontinuity around the cutoff score. By employing hand-collected survey data, we find that scoring above the cutoff not only increases the chance of entering an elite college but also raises a young person’s first-job wages after graduation. We also find that those just above the cutoff have peers with higher scores and better social networks than those below the cutoff, but it is less clear whether the two groups use their time differently in college.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000074

Combining administrative data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and short-time work registrations, firm- and employee-level surveys and cell phone tracking data on mobility patterns, we find that WFH effectively shields employees from short-time work, firms from COVID-19 distress and substantially reduces infection risks. Counties with a higher share of teleworkable jobs experience fewer short-time work registrations and less SARS-CoV-2 cases. At the firm level, an exogenous increase in the take-up of WFH reduces the probability of filing for short-time work by up to 72 p.p. and the probability of being very negatively affected by the crisis by up to 75 p.p. Health benefits of WFH appeared mostly in the early stage of the pandemic and became smaller once tight confinement rules were implemented. This effect was driven by lower initial mobility levels in counties with more teleworkable jobs and a subsequent convergence in traffic levels once confinement was implemented. Our results imply that confinement and incentivizing WFH are substitutive policies to slow the spread of the coronavirus.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721000098

However, the gains from choice may fail to materialise in markets characterised by information frictions and switching costs. We use two large-scale randomised field experiments in primary health care to examine if individuals reconsider their provider choice when receiving leaflets with comparative information and pre-paid choice forms by postal mail. The first experiment targeted a representative subset of the 1.3 million residents in a Swedish region. The second targeted new residents in the same region, a group expected to have less prior information and lower switching costs than the general population. The propensity to switch providers increased after the interventions in both the population-representative sample (by 0.6–0.8 percentage points, 10–14%) and among new residents (2.3 percentage points, 26%). The results demonstrate that there are demand side frictions in the primary care market.

We show that the state government reacted to the intervention by allocating additional resources to program villages with aligned incumbents. Consequently, party switching by opposition incumbents in favor of the ruling party went up significantly in program villages. Moreover, the reelection rate of opposition party incumbents went down due to the intervention, especially for those who didn’t switch parties.

Today, rugged individualism is more prevalent in counties with greater total frontier experience (TFE) during the era of westward expansion. While individualism may be conducive to innovation, it can also undermine collective action, with potentially adverse social consequences. We argue that America’s frontier culture hampered responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Across U.S. counties, greater TFE is associated with less social distancing and mask use as well as weaker local government effort to control the virus. We argue that frontier culture lies at the root of several more proximate explanations for the weak collective response to public health risks, including a lack of civic duty, partisanship, and distrust in science.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302218

Taking advantage of this natural experiment, we examined how the proactive closure of elementary schools affected various outcomes related to children and family well-being. To identify the causal effects of the school closure, we exploited the discontinuity in the probability of going to school at a certain threshold of age in months and conducted fuzzy regression discontinuity analyses. The data are from a large-scale online survey of mothers whose firstborn children were aged 4 to 10 years. The results revealed a large increase in children’s weight and in mothers’ anxiety over how to raise their children. On the outcomes related to marital relationships, such as the incidence of domestic violence and the quality of marriage, we did not find statistically significant changes.

It shows that an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) with negative marginal taxes and negative participation taxes at the bottom is optimal if, first, semi-elasticities of participation are decreasing along the income distribution and, second, social concerns for redistribution from the poor to the very poor are sufficiently weak. This result is driven by a previously neglected trade-off between distortions at the intensive margin and distortions at the extensive margin, i.e., between two aspects of efficiency.

Moreover, this experimental measure of prosociality predicts health behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, measured in a separate and ostensibly unrelated study with the same people. Prosocial individuals are more likely to follow physical distancing guidelines, stay home when sick, and buy face masks. We also find that prosociality measured two years before the pandemic predicts health behaviors during the pandemic.

The incentive of each coalition member to join and subsequently to sign a long-term contract is to prevent inefficient delay that arises as soon as a single country deviates.

Journal of Public Economics,2021,The targeting benefit of conditional cash transfers,Katy Bergstrom and William Dodds,"Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) are a popular type of social welfare program that make payments to households conditional on human capital investments in children. From a targeting perspective, compared to unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), CCTs are costly because they exclude some low-income households as access is tied to normal investments in children. However, we argue that conditionalities on children’s school enrollment offer an unexplored targeting benefit over UCTs: CCTs target money to households who forgo a discrete amount of child income. We show that the size of the targeting benefit relative to the targeting cost of CCTs is directly related to the consumption differences between schooling and non-schooling households and two elasticities already popular in the literature: the income effect of a UCT and the price effect of a CCT. We estimate these elasticities for a large CCT program in rural Mexico, Progresa, using variation in transfers to younger siblings to identify income effects. In this setting, we find that the targeting benefit is a similar magnitude to the cost of excluding some low-income households; this implies that 33% of the Progresa budget should go to a CCT over a UCT based on targeting grounds alone.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301948

Using an economic experiment in Afghanistan, we show how the ability to impose financial penalties can help to overcome this. We use a trust game with two special features: investors communicate a desired back-transfer and, in some treatments, can choose whether to conditionally impose a small fine on trustees who do not comply with this request. We randomly paired subjects with either a co-ethnic or someone from a different ethnic group. We find that when investors do not have the ability to impose a fine, subjects are more trustworthy towards co-ethnics. When the fine is imposed by a co-ethnic, it has little effect. However, in cross-ethnic interactions, the fine increases trustworthiness, virtually eliminating in-group bias. Interestingly, this result is qualitatively similar when the fine is available to the investor but not used. These results suggest that institutions for enforcing cooperation are more effective when applied between, rather than within, ethnic groups, due to behavioral differences in how individuals respond to pecuniary sanctions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302115

In isolation, payroll subsidies that preserve match capital and enable a swift economic recovery are preferred over a cost-equivalent UI expansion. When considered jointly, however, a cost-equivalent optimal mix allocates 20 percent of the budget to payroll subsidies and 80 percent to UI.

Journal of Public Economics,2021,Shaming as an incentive mechanism against stealing: Behavioral and physiological evidence,"Isabelle Brocas, Juan D. Carrillo and Mallory Montgomery","We study experimentally the decision of an individual to steal or pay for an object that is produced at a cost by another individual. We consider two conditions. In the first condition, subjects caught stealing are sanctioned with a nominal fee. In the second condition, the sanction is increased by making the identity of the individual public (shaming). We also collect skin conductance responses to better understand the emotional arousal conducive to choices. Behaviorally, we show that stealing decreases significantly when shaming is introduced. More importantly, the emotional response at the time of decision strongly correlates with behavior. In particular, subjects who are more aroused are more likely to steal in the first condition, and also more likely to stop stealing in the second condition. Based on this physiological evidence, we develop a theoretical model where current decisions contribute to a “moral stock”, which in turns affects the future cost of stealing and therefore the future decisions. The structural estimation of this model provides a good fit while capturing the heterogeneity across individuals.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302152
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Political hierarchy and regional economic development: Evidence from a spatial discontinuity in China,"Junxue Jia, Xuan Liang and Guangrong Ma","This study investigates the effect of political hierarchy on regional economic development using evidence from Chongqing’s promotion to the level of a province in China. In 1997, the prefecture-level Chongqing city was elevated to a province-level municipality, splitting off from Sichuan province, and it consequently gained a substantial increase in decision-making power for administrative, personnel, and fiscal affairs. The border areas between Chongqing and Sichuan had similar characteristics prior to treatment, allowing us to adopt a spatial regression discontinuity approach. Examining growth in town-level light intensity from 1992–2013, we find that economic activities of Chongqing towns are parallel with Sichuan towns before treatment, but activities increase sharply immediately following Chongqing’s promotion, implying an increase of 1.8 percentage-points in the annual GDP growth rate. Furthermore, we find that government officials of Chongqing have higher accountability and enact more pro-growth policies than officials of Sichuan. The results provide new evidence that empowering local governments through increased political hierarchy promotes regional development.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302164
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Housing liquidity and long-term care insurance demand: A quantitative evaluation,Bertrand Achou,"In theory, illiquid housing may substitute for long-term care insurance (LTCI) as retirees decumulate housing wealth mainly when moving to long-term care facilities. In this paper, I build and estimate a rich life-cycle model of single retirees in order to evaluate whether the impact of housing liquidity on LTCI demand is large. Overall, I find that the prospects of increasing LTCI demand by making housing more liquid are quite limited, as even large increases in housing liquidity generate modest increases in LTCI demand. I also find a limited impact of housing liquidity on the demand for life annuities. Finally, I show that the types of bequest motives used to rationalize the low take-up of reverse mortgages are generally inconsistent with the low demand for LTCI, suggesting that other factors may play a role in this low take-up of reverse mortgages.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302176
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Inequality of fear and self-quarantine: Is there a trade-off between GDP and public health?,"Sangmin Aum, Sang Yoon (Tim) Lee and Yongseok Shin","We construct a quantitative model of an economy hit by a pandemic. People choose occupations and make work-from-home decisions to maximize income and minimize their fear of infection. Occupations differ by wage, infection risk, and the productivity loss when working from home. The model is calibrated to South Korea (SK) and the United Kingdom (UK) to compare SK’s intensive testing and quarantine policy against UK’s lockdown. We find that SK’s policies would have worked equally well in the UK, dramatically reducing both deaths and GDP losses. The key contrast between UK’s lockdown and SK’s policies was not in the intensity of testing, but weak restrictions on the activity of many (UK) versus strict restrictions on a targeted few (SK). Lockdowns themselves may not present a clear trade-off between GDP and public health either. A premature lifting of the lockdown raises GDP temporarily, but infections rise over time and people voluntarily choose to work from home for fear of infection, generating a W-shaped recession. Finally, we find that low-skill workers and self-employed always lose the most from both the pandemic itself and containment policies.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302188

We focus on cesarean section rates for first-time mothers, which is a common indicator of appropriateness in healthcare and is vulnerable to providers’ opportunistic behaviors. To identify the causal effect of institutional quality we rely on an IV strategy based on historical instruments, exploiting the idea that current differences in institutional quality across regions have been shaped by different cultural and political histories. We find that a standard deviation increase in our indicator of institutional quality leads to a decrease of about 10 percentage points in cesarean section rates. Our results are robust to different measures of institutional quality and samples.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302206

Journal of Public Economics,2021,Is four less than five? Effects of four-day school weeks on student achievement in Oregon,Paul N. Thompson,"The achievement impacts of educational input quality have been well documented, but the quantity of exposure to the school environment – as measured by instructional time – also has profound impacts on students. This study examines the achievement impacts of a key instructional time reducing cost savings policy – the four-day school week. Using 3rd through 8th grade test scores from Oregon from 2005 to 2019 in a difference-in-differences analysis, I find that math test scores decrease by between 0.037 and 0.059 standard deviations and reading scores decrease by between 0.033 and 0.042 standard deviations following the switch to the four-day school week. It appears that reductions in time in school, which amount to three to four hours per week, largely drive these achievement declines. Using four-day school week adoption as an instrument for weekly time in school, I find that a one-hour increase in weekly time in school leads to a 0.018 standard deviation increase in math achievement and a 0.006 standard deviation increase in reading achievement. Finally, I compare the cost savings-achievement trade-off of the four-day school week with other traditional cost savings approaches and find that the four-day school week yields a comparable cost savings-achievement trade-off to many of these other interventions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301729
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Behavioral responses to inheritance and gift taxation: Evidence from Germany,Ulrich Glogowsky,"The desirability of inheritance and gift taxes depends on individuals’ tax responsiveness. This paper demonstrates how strongly, and in what way, the German inheritance and gift tax influences taxpayer behavior. To that end, it combines administrative data with cross-bracket tax variation: a convex kink in the tax liability precedes a concave kink. Extending the bunching approach to such double-kinked tax schedules, I document that individuals tailor their taxable wealth transfers to the schedules. One type of response dominates for inheritances: testators engage in testament planning. The magnitude of the testament-planning response is comparable to that of inter vivos gifts. However, neither the overall responses of gifts nor those of inheritances heavily interfere with tax revenue collection: the associated short-run net-of-tax elasticities of taxable wealth transfers lie below 0.1.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301730

This effect is robust to including controls for political ideology, income, age, education, and other local-level characteristics. This result is present for U.S. individuals and U.S. counties as well as European regions. Moreover, we show that after U.S. states began re-opening, high civic capital counties maintained a more sustained level of social distancing, while low civic capital counties did not. Finally, we show that U.S. individuals report a higher tendency to use protective face masks in high civic capital counties. Our evidence points to the importance of considering the level of civic capital in designing public policies not only in response to pandemics, but also more generally.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301742
Journal of Public Economics,2021,"Fear, lockdown, and diversion: Comparing drivers of pandemic economic decline 2020",Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson,"The collapse of economic activity in 2020 from COVID-19 has been immense. An important question is how much of that collapse resulted from government-imposed restrictions versus people voluntarily choosing to stay home to avoid infection. This paper examines the drivers of the economic slowdown using cellular phone records data on customer visits to more than 2.25 million individual businesses across 110 different industries. Comparing consumer behavior over the crisis within the same commuting zones but across state and county boundaries with different policy regimes suggests that legal shutdown orders account for only a modest share of the massive changes to consumer behavior (and that tracking county-level policy conditions is significantly more accurate than using state-level policies alone). While overall consumer traffic fell by 60 percentage points, legal restrictions explain only 7 percentage points of this. Individual choices were far more important and seem tied to fears of infection. Traffic started dropping before the legal orders were in place; was highly influenced by the number of COVID deaths reported in the county; and showed a clear shift by consumers away from busier, more crowded stores toward smaller, less busy stores in the same industry. States that repealed their shutdown orders saw symmetric, modest recoveries in consumer visits, further supporting the small estimated effect of policy. Although the shutdown orders had little aggregate impact, they did have a significant effect in reallocating consumer visits away from “nonessential” to “essential” businesses and from restaurants and bars toward groceries and other food sellers.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301754

Lee, Mahreen Mahmud, Jonathan Morduch, Saravana Ravindran and Abu Shonchoy","The initial spread of COVID-19 halted economic activity as countries around the world restricted the mobility of their citizens. As a result, many migrant workers returned home, spreading the virus across borders. We investigate the relationship between migrant movements and the spread of COVID-19 using district-day-level data from Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan (the 1st, 6th, and 7th largest sources of international migrant workers). We find that during the initial stage of the pandemic, a 1 SD increase in prior international out-migration relative to the district-wise average in India and Pakistan predicts a 48% increase in the number of cases per capita. In Bangladesh, however, the estimates are not statistically distinguishable from zero. Domestic out-migration predicts COVID-19 diffusion in India, but not in Bangladesh and Pakistan. In all three countries, the association of COVID-19 cases per capita and measures of international out-migration increases over time. The results show how migration data can be used to predict coronavirus hotspots. More broadly, the results are consistent with large cross-border negative externalities created by policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 in migrant-receiving countries.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301766
Journal of Public Economics,2021,The anatomy of behavioral responses to social assistance when informal employment is high,Marcelo Bergolo and Guillermo Cruces,"The disincentive effects of social assistance programs on registered (or formal) employment are a first-order policy concern in developing and middle-income countries. We study the impact of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program in Uruguay on the employment of adult members in beneficiary households in a context of high informality. Our research design relies on the sharp discontinuity introduced by program eligibility rules around a poverty score threshold combined with longitudinal administrative data. We find reductions of about 6 percentage points (a 13% drop) in formal labor force participation among all beneficiaries and of 8.7 percentage points (a 19% drop) for single mothers. The implied elasticity of participation in the formal sector with respect to the net-of-tax rate is about 0.78 for the full sample and about 1.3 for single mothers. The reduction in labor supply is stronger among individuals who have a medium propensity to be formally employed, with a smaller reduction in the case of infra-marginal individuals. We also present suggestive evidence that the reduction in formal employment increases inactivity and informal work in equal proportions. Finally, despite pervasive informality in the context of the Family Allowance assistance program (AFAM), the program’s marginal value of public funds of 0.61 implies an efficiency cost within the range of cash transfer programs targeted to families in the United States.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301778
Journal of Public Economics,2021,State and local government employment in the COVID-19 crisis,Daniel Green and Erik Loualiche,"Local governments are facing large losses in revenues and increased expenditures because of the COVID-19 crisis. We document a causal relationship between fiscal pressures induced by COVID-19 and the layoffs of state and local government workers. States that depend more on sales tax as a source of revenue laid off significantly more workers than other states. The CARES Act’s provision of $150 billion in aid to state and local governments reduced the fiscal pressures they faced. Exploiting a kink in the formula for allocation of funding across states, we estimate that without this funding state and local governments would have laid off an additional 401,000 workers in April 2020, 40 percent more than realized. State rainy day fund balances limit the sensitivity of employment to these revenue shocks, revealing that balanced budget requirements for state and local governments increase the procyclicality of public service provision.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301857

In the first intervention, students receive a normative statement reminding them that they should not discriminate in SETs. In the second intervention, the normative statement includes precise information about how other students (especially male students) have discriminated against female teachers in previous years. The purely normative statement has no significant impact on SET overall satisfaction scores, suggesting that a blanket awareness-raising campaign may be inefficient to reduce discrimination. However, the informational statement appears to significantly reduce gender discrimination. The effect we find mainly comes from a change in male students’ evaluation of female teachers.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301870
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Contagion of populist extremism,Daiki Kishishita and Atsushi Yamagishi,"To explore the propagation of undesirable policies in a form of populist extremism, we construct a social learning model featuring agency problems. Politicians in different countries sequentially implement a policy. Voters learn the incumbent politician’s type and the desirable policy by observing foreign policies on top of the domestic policy. We show that populist extremism is contagious across countries through the dynamic interaction between the changing public opinion and implemented policies. This structure yields interesting long-run dynamics. First, a single moderate policy could be always enough to stop the domino effect. Second, the persistence of the domino effect depends on the correlation of the desirable policy across countries. In particular, while extremism eventually ends under the perfect correlation, it may become impossible to escape from extremism under the imperfect correlation. These results illuminate a new negative aspect of decentralized policymaking.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301882
Journal of Public Economics,2021,Legislating during war: Conflict and politics in Colombia,Juan Morales,"This paper studies how politicians and their constituents respond to political violence by investigating the Colombian civil conflict. I use data on rebel attacks, legislators’ tweets, and roll-call votes, and I employ event-study and difference-in-differences empirical methods. After rebel attacks, Twitter engagement (as a proxy for popular support) increased both for incumbent-party legislators’ tweets and for legislators’ tweets using hard-line language. Legislators increased their support for the incumbent party after attacks but only when the government had a hard-line policy position as inferred both from the recent historical context and from text analysis of the president’s tweets. Though the effects were initially large, they lasted less than two weeks. The empirical results are consistent with a political economy model of legislative behaviour in which violent events, that produce rally-‘round-the-flag effects and shift voters’ views, elicit different responses from politicians depending on the policy position of the incumbent party. Finally, I identify a set of potentially affected congressional votes, revealing that these conflict-induced swings in incumbent support can have persistent policy consequences.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301894
Journal of Public Economics,2021,"Benefit duration, job search behavior and re-employment",Andreas Lichter and Amelie Schiprowski,"This paper studies how the potential duration of unemployment benefits affects early job search behavior and re-employment outcomes. We exploit an unexpected reform of the German unemployment insurance (UI) scheme in 2008, which increased the potential benefit duration from 12 to 15 months for benefit recipients of age 50 to 54. Based on detailed survey data and a difference-in-differences design, we estimate that one additional month of potential benefits reduces early job applications by around 10%. Using social security data, we further find that the extension of benefits increases the average nonemployment duration of individuals entering UI after the reform. Among individuals who got treated at later stages of their unemployment spell, the increased UI coverage does not appear to come at the cost of longer nonemployment. A cautious back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals substantial job finding returns to early search effort.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301900

We find that, in both countries, earnings display important deviations from the typical assumptions of linearity and normality. Individual-level male wage and earnings risk is relatively high at the beginning and end of the working life, and for those in the lower and upper parts of the income distribution. Hours are the main driver of the negative skewness and, to a lesser extent, the high kurtosis of earnings changes. Even though we find no evidence of added-worker effects, the presence of spousal earnings reduces the variability of household income compared to that of male earnings. In the Netherlands, government transfers are a major source of insurance, substantially reducing the standard deviation, negative skewness, and kurtosis of income changes. In the U.S. the role of family insurance is much larger than in the Netherlands. Family and government insurance reduce, but do not eliminate non-linearities in household disposable income by age and previous earnings in either country.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720301912

Understanding Society is based on probability samples and the Covid-19 Study is constructed carefully to support valid population inferences. The Covid-19 Study collected novel data on the mitigation strategies that individuals and households employ. Further, prior observation of respondents in the panel allows us to characterize regressivity with respect to pre-pandemic economic positions. Our key findings are that those with precarious employment, aged under 30 and from minority ethnic groups faced the biggest labour market shocks. Almost 50% of individuals have experienced declines in household earnings of at least 10%, but declines are most severe in the bottom pre-pandemic income quintiles.

We test this hypothesis by examining how exposure to previous epidemics affected trust in science and scientists. Building on the “impressionable years hypothesis” that attitudes are durably formed during the ages 18–25, we focus on individuals exposed to epidemics in their country of residence at this particular stage of the life course. Combining data from a 2018 Wellcome Trust survey of more than 75,000 individuals in 138 countries with data on global epidemics since 1970, we show that such exposure has no impact on views of science as an endeavor but that it significantly reduces trust in scientists and in the benefits of their work. We also illustrate that the decline in trust is driven by the individuals with little previous training in science subjects. Finally, our evidence suggests that epidemic-induced distrust translates into lower compliance with health-related policies in the form of negative views towards vaccines and lower rates of child vaccination.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302073

By April 2020, nationwide search intensity for both school- and parent-centered online learning resources had roughly doubled relative to pre-Covid levels. Areas of the country with higher income, better internet access and fewer rural schools saw substantially larger increases in search intensity. The pandemic will likely widen achievement gaps along these dimensions given schools’ and parents’ differing engagement with online resources to compensate for lost school-based learning time. Accounting for such differences and promoting more equitable access to online learning could improve the effectiveness of education policy responses to the pandemic.
