Journal of Political Economy,2021,"Child’s Gender, Young Fathers’ Crime, and Spillover Effects in Criminal Behavior",Christian Dustmann and Rasmus Landersø,"Men who father their first child at a very young age are convicted of significantly fewer crimes in the first years after birth if the child is a son rather than a daughter. This leads to behavioral spillovers that reduce criminal convictions among other young men living in the same neighborhood, with the resulting crime multipliers affecting peers’ crime even after the primary impact on the focal individual has dissipated. Through social multipliers, prevention policies that target potential criminals at an early stage, therefore, lead to larger reductions in the cost of crime than suggested by primary effects alone.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716562
Journal of Political Economy,2021,How Does Incarceration Affect Reoffending? Estimating the Dose-Response Function,Evan K. Rose and Yotam Shem-Tov,"We study the causal effect of incarceration on reoffending using discontinuities in North Carolina’s sentencing guidelines. A regression discontinuity analysis shows that 1 year of incarceration causes a reduction in the likelihood of being reincarcerated within 3, 5, and 8 years from sentencing by 44%, 29%, and 21%, respectively. To parse the potentially heterogeneous dose response relationship underlying these effects, we develop an econometric model of prison sentences and recidivism. We find that incarceration has meaningful reoffending-reducing average effects that diminish in incarceration length. As a result, budget-neutral reductions in sentence length combined with increases in incarceration rates can decrease recidivism.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716561
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Efficiency and Foreclosure Effects of Vertical Rebates: Empirical Evidence,Christopher T. Conlon and Julie Mortimer,"In many industries, upstream manufacturers pay downstream retailers for achieving quantity or market share targets. These “vertical rebates” may mitigate downstream moral hazard by inducing greater retail effort but may also incentivize retailers to drop competing products. We study these offsetting effects empirically for a rebate paid to one retailer. Using a field experiment, we exogenously vary the outcome of retailer effort. We estimate models of consumer choice and retailer behavior to quantify the rebate’s effect on retail assortment and effort. We find that the rebate is designed to exclude a competing product and fails to maximize social surplus.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716563
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Financial Development and International Trade,Fernando Leibovici,"This paper studies the industry-level and aggregate implications of financial development on international trade. I set up a multi-industry general equilibrium model of international trade with input-output linkages and heterogeneous firms subject to financial frictions. Industries differ in capital intensity, which leads to differences in external finance dependence. The model is parameterized to match key features of firm-level data. Financial development leads to substantial reallocation of international trade shares from labor- to capital-intensive industries, with minor effects at the aggregate level. These findings are consistent with estimates from cross-country industry-level and aggregate data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716564
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Forecast Hedging and Calibration,Dean Foster and Sergiu Hart,"Calibration means that forecasts and average realized frequencies are close. We develop the concept of forecast hedging, which consists of choosing the forecasts so as to guarantee that the expected track record can only improve. This yields all the calibration results by the same simple basic argument while differentiating between them by the forecast-hedging tools used: deterministic and fixed point based versus stochastic and minimax based. Additional contributions are an improved definition of continuous calibration, ensuing game dynamics that yield Nash equilibria in the long run, and a new calibrated forecasting procedure for binary events that is simpler than all known such procedures.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716559
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Goods and Factor Market Integration: A Quantitative Assessment of the EU Enlargement,"Lorenzo Caliendo, Luca David Opromolla, Fernando Parro and Alessandro Sforza","We build a multicountry dynamic general equilibrium model to study the economic effects of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union. In our model, trade is costly and households of different skills and nationalities face costly forward-looking migration decisions. We exploit the timing of migration policy changes to identify the changes in migration costs. We find that the changes in migration and trade policy resulted in aggregate welfare gains but with heterogeneous effects across skill groups. We study the interaction between trade and migration policies and highlight the importance of trade for quantifying the welfare and migration effects of labor market integration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716560
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Market Structure and Competition in Airline Markets,"Federico Ciliberto, Charles Murry and Elie Tamer",We provide an econometric framework for estimating a game of simultaneous entry and pricing decisions while allowing for correlations between unobserved cost and demand shocks. We use our framework to account for selection in the pricing stage. We estimate the model using data from the US airline industry and find that not accounting for endogenous entry leads to biased estimation of demand elasticities. We simulate a merger between American and US Airways and find that product repositioning and postmerger outcomes depend on how we model the characteristics of the merged firm as a function of the premerger firms’ characteristics.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715848
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Directed Technical Change as a Response to Natural Resource Scarcity,"John Hassler, Per Krusell and Conny Olovsson","We develop a quantitative macroeconomic theory of input-saving technical change to analyze how markets economize on scarce natural resources, with an application to fossil fuel. We find that aggregate US data call for a very low short-run substitution elasticity between energy and the capital/labor inputs. Our estimates imply that energy-saving technical change took off when the oil shocks hit in the 1970s. This response implies significant substitutability with the other inputs in the long run: even under ever-rising energy prices, long-run consumption growth is still possible, along with a modest factor share of energy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715849
Journal of Political Economy,2021,The Power of Referential Advice,"Steven Callander, Nicolas Lambert and Niko Matouschek","Expert advice often extends beyond a simple recommendation, including information about alternative options. To explore the role of this referential advice, we enrich the expert’s informational advantage in a canonical model of communication with hard information. We show that when constructed just right, referential advice dissuades the decision maker from choosing options other than the recommendation, thereby making the recommendation itself more persuasive. We identify an equilibrium in which, with probability 1, the expert is strictly better off providing referential advice than she is in any equilibrium in which she provides a recommendation alone.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715850
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Optimal Income Taxation: Mirrlees Meets Ramsey,Jonathan Heathcote and Hitoshi Tsujiyama,"We explore the optimal shape of the income tax and transfer schedule in an environment with distinct roles for public and private insurance. In a calibration to the United States, we find that the optimal system features marginal tax rates that increase in income. When we increase pressure on the government to raise revenue, the optimal marginal tax schedule becomes first flatter and then U-shaped, reconciling various findings in the literature. A power function parametric tax schedule outperforms an affine one, indicating that tax progressivity is more important than lump-sum transfers. We also explore various social welfare objectives and Pareto-improving reforms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715851
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Comparison of Decisions under Unknown Experiments,Andrew Caplin and Daniel Martin,"We take the perspective of an econometrician who wants to determine which of two experiments provides higher expected utility but only knows the decisions under each experiment. To compare these decisions, the econometrician must make inferences about what the experiment might have been for each set of decisions. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition that identifies when every experiment consistent with one set of decisions has a higher value of information than every experiment consistent with the other set of decisions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716104
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Coalition Formation in Legislative Bargaining,Marco Battaglini,"We propose a new model of legislative bargaining in which coalitions may have different values, reflecting the fact that the policies they can pursue are constrained by the identity of the coalition members. As the delay between offers goes to zero, the equilibrium allocation of the model converges to a generalized version of a Nash bargaining solution in which—in contrast to the standard solution—the winning coalition is endogenous and determined by the relative coalitional values. A form of the holdup problem specific to these bargaining games contributes to generate significant inefficiencies in the selection of the coalition. The model helps rationalize well-known empirical facts that are in conflict with the predictions of standard noncooperative models of bargaining.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716105
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Liquidity Rules and Credit Booms,Kinda Hachem and Zheng Song,"This paper shows that liquidity regulation can trigger unintended credit booms in the presence of interbank market power. We consider a price setter and a continuum of price takers who trade reserves after the realization of idiosyncratic liquidity shocks. The price takers are endogenously less liquid and circumvent regulation by engaging in shadow banking, which leads to a reallocation of funding away from the more liquid price setter. This reallocation channel underlies the credit boom. Endogenous responses in bank liquidity ratios also affect the magnitude of the boom. We discuss extensions of the model and illustrate its quantitative performance with an application to China.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715074
Journal of Political Economy,2021,The Production Function for Housing: Evidence from France,"Pierre-Philippe Combes, Gilles Duranton and Laurent Gobillon","We propose a new nonparametric approach to estimate the production function for housing. Our estimation treats output as a latent variable and relies on a first-order condition for profit maximization combined with a zero-profit condition. More desirable locations command higher land prices and, in turn, more capital to build houses. For parcels of a given size, we compute housing production by summing across the marginal products of capital. For newly built single-family homes in France, the production function for housing is close to constant returns and is well, though not perfectly, approximated by a Cobb-Douglas function with a capital elasticity of 0.65.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715076
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Do Environmental Markets Improve on Open Access? Evidence from California Groundwater Rights,"Andrew Ayres, Kyle C. Meng and Andrew J. Plantinga","Environmental markets are widely prescribed as an alternative to open access regimes for natural resources. We develop a model of dynamic groundwater extraction to demonstrate how a spatial regression discontinuity design that exploits a spatially incomplete market for groundwater rights recovers a lower bound on the market’s net benefit. We apply this estimator to a major aquifer in water-scarce southern California and find that a groundwater market generated substantial net benefits, as capitalized in land values. Heterogeneity analyses point to gains arising in part from rights trading, enabling more efficient water use across sectors. Additional findings suggest that the market increased groundwater levels.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715075
Journal of Political Economy,2021,The Transmission of Monetary Policy under the Microscope,"Martin Holm, Pascal Paul and Andreas Tischbirek","We investigate the transmission of monetary policy to household consumption using administrative data on the universe of households in Norway. On the basis of identified monetary policy shocks, we estimate the dynamic responses of consumption, income, and saving along the liquid asset distribution of households. For low-liquidity but also for high-liquidity households, changes in disposable income are associated with a sizable consumption reaction. The impact consumption response is closely linked to interest rate exposure, which is negative at the bottom but positive at the top of the distribution. Indirect effects of monetary policy gradually build up and eventually outweigh the direct effects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715416
Journal of Political Economy,2021,The Path to College Education: The Role of Math and Verbal Skills,Esteban Aucejo and Jonathan James,"This paper studies the formation of math and verbal skills during compulsory education and their impact on educational attainment. Using longitudinal data that follow students in England from elementary school to university, we find that the production functions of math and verbal skills are inherently different, where cross effects are present only in the production of math skills. Results on long-term educational outcomes indicate that verbal skills play a substantially greater role in explaining university enrollment than math skills. This finding, combined with the large female advantage in verbal skills, has key implications for gender gaps in college enrollment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715417
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Understanding Disparities in Punishment: Regulator Preferences and Expertise,Karam Kang and Bernardo S. Silveira,"This paper quantifies the benefits of discretion in the enforcement of environmental regulations. We identify and estimate a structural model of regulator-discharger interactions, exploiting an increase in the enforcement stringency of water pollution regulations in California. Our estimates indicate that most of the heterogeneity in punishments for observably similar violations is due to heterogeneity in discharger compliance costs rather than heterogeneity in regulator preferences. We find that removing the discretion of regulators to tailor punishments to discharger attributes would raise enforcement costs and decrease compliance by dischargers with high social harms of violations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715415
Journal of Political Economy,2021,"Discrimination, Managers, and Firm Performance: Evidence from “Aryanizations” in Nazi Germany","Kilian Huber, Volker Lindenthal and Fabian Waldinger","Large-scale increases in discrimination can lead to dismissals of highly qualified managers. We investigate how expulsions of senior Jewish managers, due to rising discrimination in Nazi Germany, affected large corporations. Firms that lost Jewish managers experienced persistent reductions in stock prices, dividends, and returns on assets. Aggregate market value fell by roughly 1.8% of German GNP because of the expulsions. Managers who served as key connectors to other firms and managers who were highly educated were particularly important for firm performance. The findings imply that individual managers drive firm performance. Discrimination against qualified business leaders causes first-order economic losses.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714994
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Socioeconomic Status and Inequalities in Children’s IQ and Economic Preferences,"Armin Falk, Fabian Kosse, Pia Pinger, Hannah Schildberg-Hörisch and Thomas Deckers","This paper explores inequalities in IQ and economic preferences between children from families of high and low socioeconomic status (SES). We document that children from high-SES families are more intelligent, patient, and altruistic as well as less risk seeking. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we propose a framework of how SES, parental investments, as well as maternal IQ and preferences influence a child’s IQ and preferences. Our results indicate that disparities in the level of parental investments hold substantial importance. In light of the importance of IQ and preferences for behaviors and outcomes, our findings offer an explanation for social immobility.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714992
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Feasible Joint Posterior Beliefs,"Itai Arieli, Yakov Babichenko, Fedor Sandomirskiy and Omer Tamuz","We study the set of possible joint posterior belief distributions of a group of agents who share a common prior regarding a binary state and who observe some information structure. For two agents, we introduce a quantitative version of Aumann’s agreement theorem and show that it is equivalent to a characterization of feasible distributions from a 1995 work by Dawid and colleagues. For any number of agents, we characterize feasible distributions in terms of a “no-trade” condition. We use these characterizations to study information structures with independent posteriors. We also study persuasion problems with multiple receivers, exploring the extreme feasible distributions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714993
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Communication and Community Enforcement,Takuo Sugaya and Alexander Wolitzky,"We study the repeated prisoner’s dilemma with random matching, a canonical model of community enforcement with decentralized information. We assume that (1) with small probability, each player is a “bad type” who never cooperates, (2) players observe and remember their partners’ identities, and (3) each player interacts with others frequently but meets any particular partner infrequently. We show that these assumptions preclude cooperation in the absence of explicit communication but that introducing within-match cheap talk communication restores cooperation. Thus, communication is essential for community enforcement.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715023
Journal of Political Economy,2021,"Social Insurance, Information Revelation, and Lack of Commitment",Mikhail Golosov and Luigi Iovino,"We study optimal provision of unemployment insurance in a model where agents privately observe arrival of job opportunities and government’s ability to commit is imperfect. Imperfect commitment implies that full information revelation is generally suboptimal. Social welfare is convex in the probability with which agents reveal their private information. In the optimum, each agent is provided with incentives to either fully reveal his private information or not reveal it at all. The optimal contract can be decentralized by a joint system of unemployment and disability benefits in a way that resembles how these systems are used in practice.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715022
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Systematic Bias in the Progress of Research,Amir Rubin and Eran Rubin,"We analyze the extent to which citing practices may be driven by strategic considerations. The discontinuation of the Journal of Business (JB) in 2006 for extraneous reasons serves as an exogenous shock for analyzing strategic citing behavior. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that articles published in JB before 2006 experienced a relative reduction in citations of approximately 20% after 2006. Since the discontinuation of JB is unrelated to the scientific contributions of its articles, the results imply that the referencing of articles is systematically affected by strategic considerations, which hinders scientific progress.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715021
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Exchange Rate Disconnect in General Equilibrium,Oleg Itskhoki and Dmitry Mukhin,"We propose a dynamic general equilibrium model of exchange rate determination that accounts for all major exchange rate puzzles, including Meese-Rogoff, Backus-Smith, purchasing power parity, and uncovered interest rate parity puzzles. We build on a standard international real business cycle model with home bias in consumption, augmented with shocks in the financial market that result in a volatile near-martingale behavior of exchange rates and ensure their empirically relevant comovement with macroeconomic variables, both nominal and real. Combining financial shocks with conventional productivity and monetary shocks allows the model to reproduce the exchange rate disconnect properties without compromising the fit of the business cycle moments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714447
Journal of Political Economy,2021,The Interaction of Bankers’ Asset and Liability Management with Liquidity Concerns,Yiran Fan,"This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model on the interaction of bankers’ asset and liability management with liquidity concerns. Bankers screen real production projects and issue deposit contracts. Liquidity concerns stem from endogenized early withdrawals of deposits. To fulfill early withdrawals, bankers sell assets in a secondary market. The paper argues that ex post asymmetric information in the secondary market distorts bankers’ incentive to screen ex ante, as bad assets are easier to sell and generate liquidity benefits. Moreover, the general equilibrium feature of the model implies that exogenous aggregate productivity shocks are amplified and that booms may lead to busts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715144
Journal of Political Economy,2021,"Search, Information, and Prices","Dirk Bergemann, Benjamin Brooks and Stephen Morris","Consider a market with identical firms offering a homogeneous good. For any given ex ante distribution of the price count (the number of firms from which a consumer obtains a quote), we derive a tight upper bound on the equilibrium distribution of sales prices. The bound holds across all models of firms’ common-prior higher-order beliefs about the price count, including the extreme cases of full information and no information. One implication of our results is that a small ex ante probability that the price count is equal to one can lead to a large increase in the expected price. The bound also applies in a large class of models where the price count distribution is endogenously determined.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714443
Journal of Political Economy,2021,On Bunching and Identification of the Taxable Income Elasticity,"Sören Blomquist, Whitney Newey, Anil Kumar and Che-Yuan Liang","The elasticity of taxable income is vital when predicting the effect of taxes. Bunching at kinks/notches has been used to estimate this elasticity. We show that when the preference distribution is unrestricted, bunching at a kink or a notch is not informative about the size of the elasticity, and neither is the entire distribution of taxable income. Bunching identifies the taxable income elasticity when the preference distribution is correctly specified across the kink and provides bounds under restrictions on the preference distribution. We find wide bounds in an empirical example based on upper and lower bounds for the preference density.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714446
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Two Blades of Grass: The Impact of the Green Revolution,"Douglas Gollin, Casper Hansen and Asger Wingender","We estimate the impact of the Green Revolution in the developing world by exploiting exogenous heterogeneity in the timing and extent of the benefits derived from high-yielding crop varieties (HYVs). We find that HYVs increased yields by 44% between 1965 and 2010, with further gains coming through reallocation of inputs. Higher yields increased income and reduced population growth. A 10-year delay of the Green Revolution would in 2010 have cost 17% of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and added 223 million people to the developing-world population. The cumulative GDP loss over 45 years would have been US$83 trillion, corresponding to approximately one year of current global GDP.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714444
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Difference-in-Differences Hedonics,Spencer Banzhaf,"Cross-sectional estimates of hedonic price functions theoretically recover marginal values for characteristics but face endogeneity problems. Consequently, economists have introduced difference-in-differences and other quasi-experimental econometric methods into hedonic models. Unfortunately, the welfare interpretation of these estimands has not been clear. This paper shows that quasi-experimental hedonics can identify the movement along the ex post price function. It further shows that this effect is a lower bound on general equilibrium welfare. Thus, nonmarginal welfare can be recovered using transparent designs without Rosen’s second stage or more structural models. The paper illustrates these results with an application to toxic facilities and housing prices.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714442
Journal of Political Economy,2021,An Equilibrium Model of the Market for Bitcoin Mining,Julien Prat and Benjamin Walter,We propose a model that uses the exchange rate of Bitcoin against the US dollar to predict the computing power of Bitcoin’s network. We show that free entry places an upper bound on mining revenues and explain how it can be identified. Calibrating the model’s parameters allows us to accurately forecast the evolution of the network computing power over time. We find that a significant share of mining rewards was invested in mining equipment and that the seigniorage income of miners was limited.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714445
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Asset Pricing with Omitted Factors,Stefano Giglio and Dacheng Xiu,"Standard estimators of risk premia in linear asset pricing models are biased if some priced factors are omitted. We propose a three-pass method to estimate the risk premium of an observable factor, which is valid even when not all factors in the model are specified or observed. The risk premium of the observable factor can be identified regardless of the rotation of the other control factors if together they span the true factor space. Our approach uses principal components of test asset returns to recover the factor space and additional regressions to obtain the risk premium of the observed factor.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714090
Journal of Political Economy,2021,On the Direction of Innovation,Hugo Hopenhayn and Francesco Squintani,"How are resources allocated across different R&D areas (i.e., problems to be solved)? As a result of dynamic congestion externalities, the competitive market allocates excessive resources into those of high return, being those with higher private (and social) payoffs. Good problems are tackled too soon, and as a result the distribution of open research problems in the socially optimal solution stochastically dominates that of the competitive equilibrium. A severe form of rent dissipation occurs in the latter, where the total value of R&D activity equals the value of allocating all resources to the least valuable problem solved. Resulting losses can be substantial.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714093
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Are Bigger Banks Better? Firm-Level Evidence from Germany,Kilian Huber,"The effects of large banks on the real economy are theoretically ambiguous and politically controversial. I identify quasi-exogenous increases in bank size in postwar Germany. I show that firms did not grow faster after their relationship banks became bigger. In fact, opaque borrowers grew more slowly. The enlarged banks did not increase profits or efficiency but worked with riskier borrowers. Bank managers benefited through higher salaries and media attention. The results are based on newly digitized microdata on German firms and their banks. Overall, the findings reveal that bigger banks do not always raise real growth and can actually harm some borrowers and the real economy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714120

Most participants play the equilibrium action either always or only when they have a dominant strategy. Although age is a determinant of equilibrium choice, some very young participants display an innate ability to play at equilibrium. Finally, the proportion of equilibrium play increases significantly until fifth grade and stabilizes afterward, suggesting that the contribution of age to equilibrium play vanishes early in life.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714118

In this setting, can modest infrastructure investments in greenfield areas where people subsequently build their own houses facilitate long-run neighborhood development? We study Sites and Services projects implemented in seven Tanzanian cities during the 1970s and 1980s, and we use a spatial regression discontinuity design to compare greenfield areas that were treated (de novo) with nearby greenfield areas that were not.

Journal of Political Economy,2021,Privacy as a Public Good: A Case for Electronic Cash,Rodney Garratt and Maarten van Oordt,"Privacy is a feature inherent to the use of cash. With steadily increasing market shares of digital payment platforms, privacy in payments may no longer be attainable in the future. We explore the potential welfare impacts of reductions in privacy in payments. In our framework, firms may use data collected through payments to price discriminate future consumers. A public good aspect arises because individuals do not internalize the full cost of failing to protect their privacy and reduce social welfare by suboptimally choosing not to protect their privacy in payments. We discuss potential remedies, including the issuance of electronic cash.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714133
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Dual Decision Processes: Retrieving Preferences When Some Choices Are Automatic,Francesco Cerigioni,"Evidence from the cognitive sciences suggests that some choices are conscious and reflect individual volition, while others tend to be automatic. Under these circumstances, standard economic modeling might not always be applicable because not all choices are the result of individual tastes. We propose a behavioral model that can be used in standard economic analysis that formalizes the way in which conscious and automatic choices arise. We then present a novel method capable of identifying a set of conscious choices from observed behavior and discuss its usefulness as a framework for studying asymmetric pricing and empirical puzzles in different settings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713730
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Hysteresis and the Welfare Effect of Corrective Policies: Theory and Evidence from an Energy-Saving Program,Francisco Costa and Francois Gerard,This paper provides stark evidence of hysteresis—the failure of an effect to reverse itself as its underlying cause is reversed—in energy demand. We estimate that half of the 23% reduction in residential electricity use caused by a 9-month-long policy that was imposed on millions of Brazilians has persisted for at least 12 years. We examine the implications of our finding by extending the traditional welfare analysis of corrective policies to allow for hysteresis. Our estimate highlights that failing to take hysteresis into account could severely bias the welfare evaluation of policies aimed at reducing (long-run) energy demand.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713729
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Cheap Trade Credit and Competition in Downstream Markets,"Mariassunta Giannetti, Nicolas Serrano-Velarde and Emanuele Tarantino","We conjecture that suppliers offer trade credit to ease competition in downstream markets. We show theoretically that suppliers that have to transfer surplus to high-bargaining-power customers would want to offer an increasing price schedule to preserve sales to other buyers. Suppliers can implement this using trade credit. Empirically, we find that suppliers grant trade credit to high-bargaining-power customers when they fear the cannibalization of sales to other customers. Exploiting a law that lowered the cost of offering trade credit, we show that higher provision of trade credit to high-bargaining-power customers leads to an expansion of the suppliers’ customer base.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713731
Journal of Political Economy,2021,The Impact of Temperature on Productivity and Labor Supply: Evidence from Indian Manufacturing,"E. Somanathan, Rohini Somanathan, Anant Sudarshan and Meenu Tewari","Hotter years are associated with lower economic output in developing countries. We show that the effect of temperature on labor is an important part of the explanation. Using microdata from selected firms in India, we estimate reduced worker productivity and increased absenteeism on hot days. Climate control significantly mitigates productivity losses. In a national panel of Indian factories, annual plant output falls by about 2% per degree Celsius. This response appears to be driven by a reduction in the output elasticity of labor. Our estimates are large enough to explain previously observed output losses in cross-country panels.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713733
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Time Will Tell: Recovering Preferences When Choices Are Noisy,"Carlos Alós-Ferrer, Ernst Fehr and Nick Netzer","When choice is stochastic, revealed preference analysis often relies on random utility models. However, it is impossible to infer preferences without assumptions on the distribution of utility noise. We show that this difficulty can be overcome by using response time data. A simple condition on response time distributions ensures that choices reveal preferences without distributional assumptions. Standard models from economics and psychology generate data fulfilling this condition. Sharper results are obtained under symmetric or Fechnerian noise, where response times allow uncovering preferences or predicting choice probabilities out of sample. Application of our tools is simple and generates remarkable prediction accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713732
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Taxation under Learning by Doing,Miltiadis Makris and Alessandro Pavan,"We study optimal income taxation when workers’ productivity is stochastic and evolves endogenously because of learning by doing. Learning by doing calls for higher wedges and alters the relation between wedges and tax rates. In a calibrated model, we find that reforming the US tax code brings significant welfare gains and that a simple tax code invariant to past incomes is approximately optimal. We isolate the role of learning by doing by comparing the aforementioned tax code to its counterpart in an economy that is identical to the calibrated one except for the exogeneity of the productivity process. Ignoring learning by doing calls for fundamentally different proposals.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713745

Using IRS data in combination with other data sources, we explore the effect of measuring inequality levels and trends with income, including real accrued capital gains based on Haig-Simons principles. While median market income fell 10% from 1989 to 2016, median economic income increased by 26% using our Haig-Simons-based measure. Top 1% income shares were lower and increased by only about one-third of that estimated using previous approaches over this period.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713098
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Human Capital Investments and Expectations about Career and Family,Matthew Wiswall and Basit Zafar,"We conducted a survey of high-ability college students and elicited beliefs about how their choice of major, and of whether to complete their degree, would affect an array of future events: earnings, employment, marriage prospects, potential spousal characteristics, and fertility. We find that students perceive large “returns” to human capital not only in their own future earnings but also in other dimensions (e.g., potential spouse’s earnings and fertility). We find evidence of students sorting into majors on the basis of these perceived returns. Family expectations are particularly important for female students’ major choices. In a follow-up survey conducted 6 years after the initial data collection, we find a close connection between expectations and current realizations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713100
Journal of Political Economy,2021,How to Improve Tax Compliance? Evidence from Population-Wide Experiments in Belgium,"Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, Clément Imbert, Johannes Spinnewijn, Teodora Tsankova and Maarten Luts","We study the impact of simplification, deterrence, and tax morale on tax compliance. We ran four natural field experiments varying the communication of the tax administration with the universe of income taxpayers in Belgium throughout the tax process. A consistent picture emerges across experiments: (i) simplifying communication substantially increases compliance, (ii) deterrence messages have an additional positive effect, (iii) invoking tax morale is not effective and often backfires. A discontinuity in enforcement intensity, combined with the experimental variation, allows us to compare simplification with standard enforcement measures. We find that simplification is far more cost-effective, allowing for substantial savings on enforcement costs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713096

To answer this question, we use individual-level census data and create historical pollution patterns derived from the locations of 5,000 industrial chimneys and an atmospheric model. We show that this observation results from path-dependent neighborhood sorting that began during the Industrial Revolution, as prevailing winds blew pollution eastward. Past pollution explains up to 20% of observed neighborhood segregation in 2011, even though coal pollution stopped in the 1970s. We develop a quantitative model to identify the role of neighborhood effects and relocation rigidities underlying this persistence.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713101

We show that match-price elasticities combine conventional price effects with the strength of warm glow, so that a match-price elasticity alone is insufficient to characterize preferences for giving. Match- and rebate-price elasticities will be different, but together they lead to new tests of underlying giving preferences. We estimate, for the first time, a match-price elasticity in a high-stakes setting together with a rebate elasticity induced by tax policy. The estimates reject extant models of giving but are consistent with the new theory.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713190

We use micro data that uniquely match individual expectations, detailed information about consumption bundles, and item-level prices. The weights consumers assign to price changes depend on the frequency of purchase, rather than expenditure share, and positive price changes loom larger than negative price changes. Prices of goods offered in the same store but not purchased do not affect inflation expectations, nor do other dimensions.

In this paper, we overturn this conclusion, showing that it does not generally hold in the same model and under the same definition of time consistency as in Lucas-Stokey. Our argument rests on the existence of an overlooked commitment problem that cannot be remedied with debt maturity: a government in the future will not necessarily tax above the peak of the Laffer curve, even if it is ex ante optimal to do so.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713191

Agents choose from among various possible prices they want to prevail in the future and buy or sell rights in these market exchanges for future trade. Each agent can choose the exchange it wants without regard to what any other agent is doing. But crucially, the right to trade in each and every exchange is priced.

The problem is equivalent to a reduced-form model where agents have nonexpected utility. The uniform-price auction and the discriminatory pay-your-bid auction with reserve prices that react to both demand and supply constitute symmetric, optimal mechanisms. We also identify a condition under which the overall optimal mechanism is indeed symmetric and illustrate the structure of the optimal asymmetric mechanism when the condition fails.

An equilibrium of the model displays a class structure, where agents sort themselves across different types of assets according to their types. High-liquidity-need agents hold on to safer portfolios than lower-liquidity-need agents whenever the variation in the value of liquidity across states raises the value of safe assets more than that of riskier assets, and vice versa.

How do people come to identify with specific groups? This paper proposes a revealed preference approach, using food consumption to uncover ethnic and religious identity choices in India. We first show that consumption \of identity goods responds to forces suggested by social identity research: group status and group salience. Moreover, identity choices respond to the cost of following the group’s prescribed behaviors. We propose and estimate a demand system to quantify the identity changes that followed India’s 1991 reforms. While social identity research has focused on status and salience, our results suggest that economic costs also play an important role.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712761

Tariffs play almost no role in services markets, however, and the literature cannot account for the strikingly different approach to trade liberalization in agreements such as the World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). We develop a model through which key features of GATS, including its emphasis on “deep integration” can be understood.

We call such acquisitions “killer acquisitions.” We develop a model illustrating this phenomenon. Using pharmaceutical industry data, we show that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed when they overlap with the acquirer’s existing product portfolio, especially when the acquirer’s market power is large because of weak competition or distant patent expiration. Conservative estimates indicate that 5.3%–7.4% of acquisitions in our sample are killer acquisitions.

The analysis is made possible by linking Korean-born children who were adopted at infancy by Norwegian parents to a population panel data set with detailed information on wealth and socioeconomic characteristics. The mechanism by which these Korean-Norwegian adoptees were assigned to adoptive families is known and effectively random.

Adaptive dynamics predict that the NE is stable for one of our parameter sets and unstable for another. The empirical price distribution is close to the NE distribution for the stable parameter set, but for the unstable parameter set it skews toward higher prices in its NE support interval.

Journal of Political Economy,2021,Identification of Hedonic Equilibrium and Nonseparable Simultaneous Equations,"Victor Chernozhukov, Alfred Galichon, Marc Henry and Brendan Pass","This paper derives conditions under which preferences and technology are nonparametrically identified in hedonic equilibrium models. With products differentiated along a quality index and agents characterized by scalar unobserved heterogeneity, single-crossing conditions on preferences and technology provide identifying restrictions in previous work. We develop similar shape restrictions in the multiattribute case. These shape restrictions, based on optimal transport theory and generalized convexity, allow us to identify preferences for goods differentiated along multiple dimensions from the observation of a single market. We thereby derive identification results for nonseparable simultaneous equations and multiattribute hedonic equilibrium models with (possibly) multiple dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity. One of our results is a proof of absolute continuity of the distribution of endogenously traded qualities, which is of independent interest.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712447
Journal of Political Economy,2021,Granular Comparative Advantage,Cecile Gaubert and Oleg Itskhoki,Large firms play a pivotal role in international trade. We develop a multisector granular model of trade where sectors host a finite number of firms. Both aggregate and granular firm-level forces shape comparative advantage. The model is estimated using French microdata on firm domestic and export sales. We find that granularity accounts for about 20% of the sectoral variation in export intensity and is more pronounced in highly export-intensive sectors. An extension to a dynamic environment with both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks reveals that firm dynamics plays a central role in shaping comparative advantage reversals observed in the data.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712444

The intermediary optimally stocks high-value products exclusively to attract consumers to visit and then profits by selling nonexclusive products that are relatively cheap to buy from upstream suppliers. Relative to the social optimum, the intermediary tends to be too big and stock too many products exclusively.

We show that there is an equilibrium in which the poorly informed startup wins more often, and has higher expected profits, than the better-informed incumbent. When the informational asymmetry is large, this is the unique equilibrium outcome. The channel by which better information becomes a competitive disadvantage appears to be new and stems from the fact that better information dulls the incentive to learn from one’s rival.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711953

Should a dealer who acquires information by taking client orders be allowed to use or share that information? We explore how information sharing affects dealers, clients, and issuer revenues in US Treasury auctions, in a model calibrated to auction results data, which we use to quantify counterfactuals. Sharing information reduces uncertainty about future value. With less uncertainty, risk-averse bidders bid more. For investors, the welfare effects of information sharing depend on how information is shared and how it affects asymmetry. The model shows that investors can benefit when dealers share information with each other, not when they share more with clients.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/711954
