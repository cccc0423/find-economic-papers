Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Living and Dying in America: An Essay on Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism,Christopher Ruhm,"This essay reviews Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism (hereafter, DEATHS) by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, a fascinating account of life and death in the United States during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. While primarily targeted toward a popular audience, the volume will be of interest to many economists and other social scientists. It postulates how American capitalism run amok—combined with and partially causing the declining economic circumstances of the less educated—has increased mortality from drugs, suicide, and chronic liver disease. After describing the material in DEATHS in considerable detail, I suggest a variety of research questions that need to be answered to confirm or refute Case and Deaton's arguments and describe challenges to their key hypotheses. Among the latter are the ability of the postulated relationships to explain the sharply differing mortality trajectories of non-Hispanic Whites, compared with other groups, and the timing of the observed mortality changes. Along the way, I raise doubts about the usefulness of the ""deaths of despair"" conceptualization, with its strong implications about causality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20211638
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Graduate Student Mental Health: Lessons from American Economics Departments,"Valentin Bolotnyy, Matthew Basilico and Paul Barreira","We study the mental health of graduate students at eight top-ranked economics PhD programs in the United States using clinically validated surveys. We find that 24.8 percent experience moderate or severe symptoms of depression or anxiety—more than two times the population average. Though our response rate was 45.1 percent and sample selection concerns exist, conservative lower bounds nonetheless suggest higher prevalence rates of such symptoms than in the general population. Mental health issues are especially prevalent at the end of the PhD program: 36.7 percent of students in years 6+ of their program experience moderate or severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, versus 21.2 percent of first-year students. Of economics students with these symptoms, 25.2 percent are in treatment, compared to 41.4 percent of graduate students in other programs. A similar percentage of economics students (40–50 percent) say they cannot honestly discuss mental health with advisers as say they cannot easily discuss nonacademic career options with them. Only 26 percent find their work to be useful always or most of the time, compared to 70 percent of economics faculty and 63 percent of the working age population. We provide recommendations for students, faculty, and administrators on ways to improve graduate student mental health.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201555
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Measurement Systems,Susanne Schennach,"Economic models often depend on quantities that are unobservable, either for privacy reasons or because they are difficult to measure. Examples of such variables include human capital (or ability), personal income, unobserved heterogeneity (such as consumer ""types""), et cetera. This situation has historically been handled either by simply using observable imperfect proxies for each of the unobservables, or by assuming that such unobservables satisfy convenient conditional mean or independence assumptions that enable their elimination from the estimation problem. However, thanks to tremendous increases in both the amount of data available and computing power, it has become possible to take full advantage of recent formal methods to infer the statistical properties of unobservable variables from multiple imperfect measurements of them. The general framework used is the concept of measurement systems in which a vector of observed variables is expressed as a (possibly nonlinear or nonparametric) function of a vector of all unobserved variables (including unobserved error terms or ""disturbances"" that may have nonadditively separable affects). The framework emphasizes important connections with related fields, such as nonlinear panel data, limited dependent variables, game theoretic models, dynamic models, and set identification. This review reports the progress made toward the central question of whether there exist plausible assumptions under which one can identify the joint distribution of the unobservables from the knowledge of the joint distribution of the observables. It also overviews empirical efforts aimed at exploiting such identification results to deliver novel findings that formally account for the unavoidable presence of unobservables.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20211355
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Legal Markets,Gillian K. Hadfield,"The existence of an effective legal system is assumed throughout economic analysis, and yet there has been little study of the economics of legal markets themselves. Research to date has focused narrowly on the economics of markets for lawyers. In this review, I distinguish legal markets from the market for lawyers and show how excessive regulation of our legal markets—by lawyers themselves—distorts economic activity and growth. It does so primarily by inhibiting investment in the legal and regulatory technologies needed to respond to the transformation of the economy wrought by globalization, digitization, aspirations for inclusion, and the coming of artificial intelligence.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201330
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Agri-food Value Chain Revolutions in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,"Christopher Barrett, Thomas Reardon, Johan Swinnen and David Zilberman","Agri-food value chains (AVCs) intermediate the flow of products between largely rural farmers, fisherfolk, or herders and increasingly urban consumers. The theoretical models that historically structured research on the economic development process assumed away AVC functions, however, and AVC firms and workers were necessarily omitted from the household data that generated most empirical findings in the agricultural and development economics literatures. As a result, the discipline has somewhat overlooked the rapid growth and structural change in AVCs over the past few decades that turned AVCs into major employers and sources of value addition, as well as key loci for technology transfer and foreign investment. This paper offers an integrated, structured, empirical narrative of how and why AVC revolutions occur in developing countries, the impacts of those changes, and the abundant economic research opportunities these structural changes afford economists.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201539
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Local Policy Choice: Theory and Empirics,"David Agrawal, William H. Hoyt and John D. Wilson","This paper critically surveys the growing literature on the policy choices of local governments. First, we identify various reasons for local government policy interactions, including fiscal competition, bidding for firms, yardstick competition, expenditure spillovers, and Tiebout sorting. We discuss theoretically what parameters should be estimated to determine the reason for competition among local governments. We emphasize how the policy outcomes emerging from this competition are affected by the presence of constraints imposed by higher-level governments. Second, we integrate theoretical and empirical analyses on the effects of fiscal decentralization on mobility, spillovers, fiscal externalities, economic outcomes, and distributional issues. Third, we identify key issues that arise in the empirical estimation of strategic interactions among local governments and highlight recent quasi-experimental evidence that has attempted to identify the mechanism at work. Finally, a synthesis model, containing multiple mechanisms and fiscal instruments, resolves some puzzles and provides guidance for future research.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201490
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Carbon Taxes,Govinda R. Timilsina,"There is a growing interest in using carbon taxes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, not only in industrialized economies but also in developing economies. Many countries have considered carbon pricing, including carbon taxes, as policy instruments to meet their emission reduction targets set under the Paris Climate Agreement. However, policy makers, particularly from developing countries, are seeking clarity on several issues—particularly the impacts of carbon taxes on the economy, the distribution of these impacts across households, carbon tax design architectures, the effects of carbon taxes on the competitiveness of carbon-intensive industries, and comparison of carbon taxes with other policy instruments for climate change mitigation. This paper aims to offer insights on these issues by synthesizing the literature available since the 1970s, when the concept of carbon tax was first introduced. This paper also identifies the areas where further investigations are needed.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20211560
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Larry Ball's The Fed and Lehman Brothers: A Review Essay,V. V. Chari,Laurence Ball argues that the Federal Reserve (the Fed) could—and should—have bailed out Lehman Brothers so that it did not have to declare bankruptcy. He presents compelling evidence that it could have. I argue that the view that the Fed should not bail out Lehman is reasonable under the circumstances the Fed was in at the time. The Lehman bankruptcy is a case study in bailouts and the attendant moral hazard problem that expectations of bailouts create. The lessons learned imply a clear case for appropriate regulatory intervention to solve the problems created when governments cannot commit themselves to not undertake bailouts.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20221515
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,The Political Economy of Populism,Sergei Guriev and Elias Papaioannou,"We synthesize the literature on the recent rise of populism. First, we discuss definitions and present descriptive evidence on the recent increase in support for populists. Second, we cover the historical evolution of populist regimes since the late nineteenth century. Third, we discuss the role of secular economic factors related to cross-border trade and automation. Fourth, we review studies on the role of the 2008–09 global financial crisis and subsequent austerity, connect them to historical work covering the Great Depression, and discuss likely mechanisms. Fifth, we discuss studies on identity politics, trust, and cultural backlash. Sixth, we discuss economic and cultural consequences of growth in immigration and the recent refugee crisis. We also discuss the gap between perceptions and reality regarding immigration. Seventh, we review studies on the impact of the internet and social media. Eighth, we discuss the literature on the implications of populism's recent rise. We conclude outlining avenues for further research.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201595
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Belief-Dependent Motivations and Psychological Game Theory,Pierpaolo Battigalli and Martin Dufwenberg,"The mathematical framework of psychological game theory is useful for describing many forms of motivation where preferences depend directly on one's own or others' beliefs.

Journal of Economic Literature,2022,The Economics of Tobacco Regulation: A Comprehensive Review,"Philip DeCicca, Donald Kenkel and Michael Lovenheim","Tobacco regulation has been a major component of health policy in the developed world since the UK Royal College of Physicians' and the US Surgeon General's reports in the 1960s. Such regulation, which has intensified in the past two decades, includes cigarette taxation, place-based smoking bans in areas ranging from bars and restaurants to workplaces, and regulations designed to make tobacco products less desirable. More recently, the availability of alternative products, most notably e-cigarettes, has increased dramatically, and these products are just starting to be regulated. Despite an extensive body of research on tobacco regulations, there remains substantial debate regarding their effectiveness, and ultimately, their impact on economic welfare. We provide the first comprehensive review of the state of research in the economics of tobacco regulation in two decades.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201482
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,The Microeconomics of Cryptocurrencies,"Hanna Halaburda, Guillaume Haeringer, Joshua Gans and Neil Gandal","Since its launch in 2009 much has been written about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains. While the discussions initially took place mostly on blogs and other popular media, we now are witnessing the emergence of a growing body of rigorous academic research on these topics. By the nature of the phenomenon analyzed, this research spans many academic disciplines including macroeconomics, law and economics, and computer science. This survey focuses on the microeconomics of cryptocurrencies themselves. What drives their supply, demand, trading price, and competition amongst them? This literature has been emerging over the past decade and the purpose of this paper is to summarize its main findings so as to establish a base upon which future research can be conducted.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201593
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Book Review: Entrenchment by Paul Starr,Gilles Saint-Paul,"Entrenchment: Wealth, Power, and the Constitution of Democratic Societies, by Paul Starr, revisits the history of political economy through the lens of a novel concept: that of entrenchment. Policies that benefit some interest groups may become entrenched and persist in spite of subsequent evolutions. Such entrenchment in turn explains why crises occur, sometimes degenerating into violent conflicts: there is a tension between entrenched custom and the need for societal change, or more simply the fact that the balance of power has shifted.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201565
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,The Historical Perspective on the Donald Trump Puzzle: A Review of Barry Eichengreen's The Populist Temptation: Economic Grievance and Political Reaction in the Modern Era,Konstantin Sonin,"In The Populist Temptation: Economic Grievance and Political Reaction in the Modern Era, Barry Eichengreen relies on historical and contemporary evidence to analyze major episodes of populism in the twenty-first century, the Trump election in the United States, and Brexit in Europe. Populism—an anti-elite, authoritarian, and nativist movement—rises in times of economic and political discontent because elites, the winners of the preceding period, are unwilling or unable to share their winnings with the losers. This review asks for a model that would allow one to differentiate a destructive populism wave and a constructive adjustment of the political system to changing circumstances.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201514
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Review of Forging the Franchise: The Political Origins of the Women's Vote,Toke S. Aidt,"Recent years have seen several 100-year anniversaries of the women's vote, and today universal and equal suffrage is an inseparable part of democracy. Dawn Teele's book, Forging the Franchise, is an inquiry into the reasons why male politicians elected by male voters gave women the right to vote in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. It offers a theory of the political origins that focuses on electoral expediency and mobilization of women's groups and it provides quantitative evidence from the three countries. It argues that women got the right to vote when the incumbents saw and needed an electoral advantage of expanding the right to vote to females. The book is of interest not only to those who want a deeper understanding of the historical process of women's enfranchisement or who are interested in the political economy of democratization, but to everyone with a concern about gender inequality in politics today.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201567

Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Stratification Economics: Core Constructs and Policy Implications,"Grieve Chelwa, Darrick Hamilton and James Stewart","This article introduces the core constructs of stratification economics to provide a coherent explanation for the persistence of intergroup inequalities. Aligned with the critical race theory concept of ""the property rights in Whiteness,"" stratification economics explicitly incorporates the concepts of identity-group investment and group-based agency in the construction of identity-group hierarchies. We survey the intellectual lineage, foundations, tenets and theoretical underpinnings of stratification economics, and conclude with a treatise on inclusive economic rights as an appropriate policy frame to empower people and counteract structural inequalities generated from inter-group conflict and competition for preferred outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20211687
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Position and Possessions: Stratification Economics and Intergroup Inequality,William Darity,"This article provides an overview of the origins and development of stratification economics as a subfield that centers the importance of identity, social ranking, and relative group position. Stratification economics developed in response to explanations for interracial/ethnic/gender inequality that invoked group-based dysfunction on the part of the subordinate community. Influences, detailed here, include the works of W. E. B. DuBois, Thorstein Veblen, Karl Marx, Eric Williams, Herbert Blumer, Claude Steele, Cecilia Ridgeway, Thomas Pettigrew, and Linda Tropp. The article concludes with an exploration of unique insights and extensions stratification economics affords a variety of themes: the impact of multiple identities, the determinants of individual productivity, variation in intensity of group identification, ""passing,"" sources of inter-group differences in wealth, and social mobility and immigration.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20211690

We review the race laws of slavery, lynching, Negro Jobs, and the making of the Black ghetto.

We focus on applications in education, poverty and economic mobility, and public finance to extract common themes and patterns. The major themes that emerge include (i) Black economists' examination of individual versus structural explanations for economic outcomes, (ii) the role played by race and discrimination, (iii) the endogenous determination of race, and (iv) the nature of objectivity and positionality in economic research. A unifying theme is a willingness of many Black economists to engage critically on economic policy issues, using frameworks both from within as well as outside of mainstream neoclassical economics.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20211686
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Racial Isolation and Marginalization of Economic Research on Race and Crime,"Patrick Mason, Samuel L. Myers and Margaret Simms","This essay examines the extent to which research on the economics of race and crime produced by Black economists or published in the flagship journal of the organization of Black economists, the Review of Black Political Economy (RBPE), is undervalued by mainstream economics. We use modern bibliometric methods to test for citation biases in the economics of crime literature. We also identify the contributions of three streams of research overlooked in the mainstream literature: identity, police use of force, and mass incarceration. We find evidence that Blacks publishing on race and crime in top economics journals are less likely to be cited than non-Blacks and that articles published in the RBPE are less likely to be cited than articles published in other journals. A review of some under-cited articles reveals that themes related to identity, police use of force, and mass incarceration hold valuable insights for policy makers and those seeking solutions to problems of persistent racial disparities in the criminal legal system.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20211688
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,An Analysis of the Literature on International Unconventional Monetary Policy,Saroj Bhattarai and Christopher Neely,"This paper evaluates the literature on international unconventional monetary policies (UMPs). Introducing market segmentation, limits-to-arbitrage, and time-consistent policy in standard models permits a theoretical role for UMP. Empirical studies provide compelling evidence that UMPs influenced international asset prices and tail risk in the desired manner. Calibrated modeling and vector autoregressive (VAR) exercises imply that these policies also improved macroeconomic outcomes. We assess the recent debate on the empirical evidence and discuss central bank assessments of UMP. Despite qualified successes, we recommend that UMP be reserved for crises and/or when the zero bound constrains conventional monetary policy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201493
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Satisficing: Integrating Two Traditions,"Florian M. Artinger, Gerd Gigerenzer and Perke Jacobs","In 1955, Herbert Simon introduced the notion of satisficing: an agent satisfices by searching for an alternative that meets an aspiration level but does not optimize. We survey more than 60 years of advances in understanding satisficing in economics, psychology, and management, identifying two research traditions that address two classes of situations: under risk, satisficing is typically inferior to optimization strategies and modeled according to the neoclassical framework; under uncertainty, satisficing strategies are often derived empirically and can be highly effective. We integrate the two research traditions and show the conditions under which satisficing can be rational.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201396
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,"Epidemics, Inequality, and Poverty in Preindustrial and Early Industrial Times",Guido Alfani,"Recent research has explored the distributive consequences of major historical epidemics, and the current crisis triggered by COVID-19 prompts us to look at the past for insights about how pandemics can affect inequalities in income, wealth, and health. The fourteenth-century Black Death, which is usually believed to have led to a significant reduction in economic inequality, has attracted the greatest attention. However, the picture becomes much more complex if other epidemics are considered. This article covers the worst epidemics of preindustrial times, from the Plague of Justinian of 540–41 to the last great European plagues of the seventeenth century, as well as the cholera waves of the nineteenth. It shows how the distributive outcomes of lethal epidemics do not only depend upon mortality rates, but are mediated by a range of factors, chief among them the institutional framework in place at the onset of each crisis. It then explores how past epidemics affected poverty, arguing that highly lethal epidemics could reduce its prevalence through two deeply different mechanisms: redistribution toward the poor or extermination of the poor. It concludes by recalling the historical connection between the progressive weakening and spacing in time of lethal epidemics and improvements in life expectancy, and by discussing how epidemics affected inequality in health and living standards.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201640

We begin by providing an overview of key contextual and epidemiological details as well as the data that are available to researchers. We then examine the effects on mortality, fertility, and the economy in the short and medium run. The role of non-pharmaceutical interventions in shaping those outcomes is discussed throughout.

Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Modern Infectious Diseases: Macroeconomic Impacts and Policy Responses,"David E. Bloom, Michael Kuhn and Klaus Prettner","We discuss and review literature on the macroeconomic effects of epidemics and pandemics since the late twentieth century. First, we cover the role of health in driving economic growth and well-being and discuss standard frameworks for assessing the economic burden of infectious diseases. Second, we sketch a general theoretical framework to evaluate the trade-offs policy makers must consider when addressing infectious diseases and their macroeconomic repercussions. In so doing, we emphasize the dependence of economic consequences on (i) disease characteristics; (ii) inequalities among individuals in terms of susceptibility, preferences, and income; and (iii) cross-country heterogeneities in terms of their institutional and macroeconomic environments. Third, we study pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical policies aimed at mitigating and preventing infectious diseases and their macroeconomic repercussions. Fourth, we discuss the health toll and economic impacts of five infectious diseases: HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and COVID-19. Although major epidemics and pandemics can take an enormous human toll and impose a staggering economic burden, early and targeted health and economic policy interventions can often mitigate both to a substantial degree.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201642
Journal of Economic Literature,2022,The Economic Impact of the Black Death,"Remi Jedwab, Noel D. Johnson and Mark Koyama","The Black Death was the largest demographic shock in European history. We review the evidence for the origins, spread, and mortality of the disease. We document that it was a plausibly exogenous shock to the European economy and trace out its aggregate and local impacts in both the short run and the long run. The initial effect of the plague was highly disruptive. Wages and per capita income rose. But, in the long run, this rise was only sustained in some parts of Europe. The other indirect long-run effects of the Black Death are associated with the growth of Europe relative to the rest of the world, especially Asia and the Middle East (the Great Divergence), a shift in the economic geography of Europe toward the northwest (the Little Divergence), the demise of serfdom in western Europe, a decline in the authority of religious institutions, and the emergence of stronger states.

Journal of Economic Literature,2022,Religion and Discrimination: A Review Essay of Persecution and Toleration: The Long Road to Religious Freedom,Sriya Iyer,"Noel D. Johnson and Mark Koyama's book, Persecution and Toleration: The Long Road to Religious Freedom, examines the links between religion, state action, and the development of liberalism in medieval Europe. It discusses a model of ""conditional toleration""; how the interaction between religion and state influences persecution and discrimination against minorities; and how religious freedom eventually paved the way for scientific advances, liberalism, and economic growth. It tackles issues such as fiscal capacity, anti-Semitism in Europe, plagues including the Black Death, heresy in the Spanish Inquisition, witchcraft trials, the Holocaust, climate shocks, and the growth of cities with emergent religious minorities. It discusses these issues for a range of countries in medieval Europe, providing rich historical detail and interpretive depth for its main argument. This is a deeply evocative book that makes an important contribution to the new economics of religion. Carefully researched and thoughtfully crafted, the themes it discusses and the ideas it raises have relevance not only for medieval European societies, with which it is principally concerned, but also for contemporary economies everywhere.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20201594
