The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Collective Reputation in Trade: Evidence from the Chinese Dairy Industry,"Jie Bai, Ludovica Gazze and Yukun Wang","The existence of collective reputation implies an important externality. Among firms trading internationally, quality shocks about one firm's products could affect the demand of other firms from the same origin country. We study such a reputation spillover in the context of a large-scale scandal that affected the Chinese dairy industry in 2008. Leveraging detailed firm-product level administrative data and official quality inspection reports, we document sizable reputation spillovers on uncontaminated firms. We further investigate potential mechanisms that could mediate the strength of collective reputation, including information accuracy, observability of the supply chain, and prior export experience.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01032
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,"Infant Health, Cognitive Performance, and Earnings: Evidence from Inception of the Welfare State in Sweden","Sonia Bhalotra, Martin Karlsson, Therese Nilsson and Nina Schwarz","We identify earnings impacts of exposure to an infant health intervention in Sweden, using individual-linked administrative data to trace potential mechanisms. Leveraging quasi-random variation in eligibility, we estimate that exposure was associated with higher test scores in primary school for boys and girls. However, only girls were more likely to score in the top quintile. Subsequent gains, in secondary schooling, employment, and earnings, are restricted to girls. We show that the differential gains for women accrued from both skills and opportunities.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01031
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Mums Go Online: Is the Internet Changing the Demand for Health Care?,"Sofia Amaral-Garcia, Mattia Nardotto, Carol Propper and Tommaso Valletti",We study the effect of Internet diffusion on childbirth procedures performed in England between 2000 and 2011. We show that broadband Internet access increased cesarean sections (C-sections): mothers living in areas with better Internet access are 2.5% more likely to obtain a C-section. The effect is driven by first-time mothers who are 6% more likely to obtain a C-section. The increased C-section rate is not accompanied by changes in health care outcomes; thus health care costs increased with no corresponding medical benefits. We show evidence documenting the growing importance of the Internet as a source of health-related information.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01033

The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Price Negotiation with Merchant Heterogeneity in the Payment Card Industry,"Chun-Yu Ho, Li Xu and Daiqiang Zhang","We examine price negotiation in the payment card industry by exploiting a unique merchant-, industry-, and city-level data set. Motivated by the substantial variation in acquirer fees and heterogeneous merchant card transactions, we use Nash bargaining to model the negotiation over the acquirer fee between an acquirer and a merchant. We find that the merchants secure a larger incremental surplus than the acquirer on average. Moreover, merchants might face upward pressure on acquirer fees as the card penetration rate rises over time, and policies that weaken the acquirer's bargaining power could relieve the upward fee pressure.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00986
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Trade Flows and Fiscal Multipliers,Matteo Cacciatore and Nora Traum,"We present novel insights on the role of international trade following unanticipated fiscal changes in a flexible exchange rate environment. We show analytically that fiscal multipliers can be larger in economies more open to trade, even when fiscal expansions imply trade deficits. Three factors determine how trade linkages matter: the relative import share of public and private goods, the financing of government debt, and the currency invoicing of exports. A Bayesian prior-predictive analysis shows that a quantitative model bears the same predictions. Conditioning on Canadian and U.S. data, we find support for larger multipliers relative to a counterfactually closed economy.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00985
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Endogenous Technological Change and the New Keynesian Model,Toshihiro Okada,"This paper develops and estimates a New Keynesian (NK) model with endogenous technology. It shows that introducing endogenous technology can solve three important puzzles that conventional NK models face: the inflation persistence, disinflationary news shock, and zero lower bound (ZLB) supply shock. First, the observed persistence in inflation is explained without relying on the conventional NK models' additional assumptions (e.g., backward price indexation). Second, it explains the observed disinflationary effect of a news shock. Third, the model avoids the conventional NK models' paradoxical, empirically inconsistent prediction that a negative supply shock is expansionary at the ZLB on interest rates.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00971
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Collaborative Production in Science: An Empirical Analysis of Coauthorships in Economics,Katharine A. Anderson and Seth Richards-Shubik,"This paper studies productivity and preferences in scientific research. Collaboration is increasingly important for innovation in science and other domains, but we have limited understanding of the factors researchers use to choose their collaborators and the projects they work on. Here, we use a model of strategic network formation and a recently developed econometric method to examine this question in the context of economics researchers. We learn that research teams with more collaborators tend to produce papers with higher impact, and without increasing individual costs of communication and coordination. This suggests the trend toward larger research teams in economics will continue.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01025
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Do Better Prisons Reduce Recidivism? Evidence from a Prison Construction Program,Santiago Tobon,"I study the effects of prison quality on recidivism using individual-level data from Colombia. To estimate causal effects, I leverage the quasi-random assignment of inmates to newer, less crowded, and higher service prisons. For inmates assigned to newer facilities, I find that the probability of returning to prison within one year is 36% lower. Criminal capital, access to rehabilitation programs, and negative prison experiences, which could trigger changes in intrinsic preferences over illegal occupations, seem to be important mechanisms. The program led to substantial welfare gains, even when assuming a low social cost per crime.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01007
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Can Agricultural Extension and Input Support Be Discontinued? Evidence from a Randomized Phaseout in Uganda,"Ram Fishman, Stephen Smith, Vida Bobic and Munshi Sulaiman","Many development programs that attempt to disseminate improved technologies are limited in duration because of external funding constraints or an assumption of impact sustainability, but there is limited evidence on whether and when terminating such programs is efficient. We provide novel experimental evidence on the impacts of a randomized phaseout of an agricultural extension and subsidy program that promotes improved inputs and cultivation practices among smallholder women farmers in Uganda. We find that phaseout does not diminish the use of either practices or inputs as farmers shift purchases from NGO-sponsored village-based supply networks to market sources. These results indicate that short-term interventions can suffice to trigger persistent effects, consistent with models of technology adoption that emphasize learning from experience.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01029
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,"Testing the Water: Drinking Water Quality, Public Notification, and Child Outcomes",Michelle Marcus,"Health-based drinking water violations affect about one in twelve Americans annually, yet the benefits of drinking water regulation are not well understood. I exploit plausibly exogenous variation in water quality violation timing to estimate the impacts on avoidance behavior and child outcomes. Using purchases of bottled water and common stomach remedies, emergency room visits for gastrointestinal illness, and school absences, I provide a comprehensive calculation of costs associated with poor drinking water quality. Individuals avoid the negative health impacts of coliform bacteria violations only when informed immediately. Timely public notification is a cost-effective way to induce avoidance behavior and protect health.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01006

We argue that this asymmetric network structure extracted from call and put traded option prices of the main U.S. banks contains valuable information for predicting macroeconomic conditions and economic uncertainty, and it can serve as a tool for forward-looking systemic risk monitoring.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01003
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Time-Varying Risk Aversion? Evidence from Near-Miss Accidents,Matthew Shum and Yi Xin,"We present evidence consistent with time-varying risk preferences among automobile drivers. Exploiting a unique data set of agents' high-frequency driving behavior collected by a mobile phone application, we show that drivers drive more conservatively following near-miss accidents. In a preferred specification, a near-miss triggers a reduction in driving distance of 12.98 kilometers, in-car cell phone use by more than 100%, and highway use by 43.24%. Structural estimation results indicate that such changes in behavior are consistent with an increase in risk aversion of 10.54% to 43.77% and a reduction in annual insurance cost amounting to 2.04% to 3.31% of the average car insurance premium.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01009
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Bridging Level-K to Nash Equilibrium,Dan Levin and Luyao Zhang,"We introduce NLK, a model that connects the Nash equilibrium (NE) and level-k. It allows a player in a game to believe that her opponent may be either less or as sophisticated as she is, a view supported in psychology. We apply NLK to data from five published papers on static, dynamic, and auction games. NLK provides different predictions from those of the NE and level-k; moreover, a simple version of NLK explains the experimental data better in many cases, with the same or fewer parameters. We discuss extensions to games with more than two players and heterogeneous beliefs.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00990
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Racial Disparities in Voting Wait Times: Evidence from Smartphone Data,"M. Keith Chen, Kareem Haggag, Devin G. Pope and Ryne Rohla","Equal access to voting is a core feature of democratic government. Using data from hundreds of thousands of smartphone users, we quantify a racial disparity in voting wait times across a nationwide sample of polling places during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Relative to entirely white neighborhoods, residents of entirely black neighborhoods waited 29% longer to vote and were 74% more likely to spend more than thirty minutes at their polling place. This disparity holds when comparing predominantly white and black polling places within the same states and counties and survives numerous robustness and placebo tests. We shed light on the mechanism for these results and discuss how geospatial data can be an effective tool to measure and monitor these disparities going forward.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01012
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Countervailing Market Power and Hospital Competition,"Eric Barrette, Gautam Gowrisankaran and Robert Town","While economic theories indicate that market power by downstream firms can potentially counteract market power upstream, antitrust policy is opaque as to whether to incorporate countervailing market power in merger analyses. We use detailed national claims data from the health care sector to evaluate whether countervailing insurer power does indeed limit hospitals' exercise of market power. We estimate willingness-to-pay models to evaluate hospital market power across analysis areas. We find that countervailing market power is important: a typical hospital merger would raise hospital prices 4.3% at the 25th percentile of insurer concentration but only 0.97% at the 75th percentile of insurer concentration.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01020
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Pass-Through of Own and Rival Cost Shocks: Evidence from the U.S. Fracking Boom,Erich Muehlegger and Richard L. Sweeney,"In imperfectly competitive settings, a firm's price depends on its own costs as well as those of its competitors. We demonstrate that this has important implications for the estimation and interpretation of pass-through. Leveraging a large input cost shock resulting from the fracking boom, we isolate price responses to firm-specific, regional, and industry-wide input cost shocks in the U.S. oil refining industry. The pass-through of these components varies from near zero to full pass-through, reconciling seemingly disparate results from the literature. We illustrate the policy implications of rival cost pass-through in the context of a tax on refinery carbon emissions.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01052
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,An Econometric Model of International Growth Dynamics for Long-Horizon Forecasting,"Ulrich K. Muller, James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson","We develop a Bayesian latent factor model of the joint long-run evolution of GDP per capita for 113 countries over the 118 years from 1900 to 2017. We find considerable heterogeneity in rates of convergence, including rates for some countries that are so slow that they might not converge (or diverge) in century-long samples, and a sparse correlation pattern (""convergence clubs"") between countries. The joint Bayesian structure allows us to compute a joint predictive distribution for the output paths of these countries over the next 100 years. This predictive distribution can be used for simulations requiring projections into the deep future, such as estimating the costs of climate change. The model's pooling of information across countries results in tighter prediction intervals than are achieved using univariate information sets. Still, even using more than a century of data on many countries, the 100-year growth paths exhibit very wide uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00997
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Estimation of a Heterogeneous Demand Function with Berkson Errors,"Richard Blundell, Joel Horowitz and Matthias Parey","Berkson errors are commonplace in empirical microeconomics. In consumer demand, this form of measurement error occurs when the price an individual pays is measured by the (weighted) average price paid by individuals in a group (e.g., a county) rather than the true transaction price. We show the importance of Berkson errors for demand estimation with nonseparable unobserved heterogeneity. We develop a consistent estimator using external information on the true price distribution. Examining gasoline demand in the United States, we document substantial within-market price variability. Accounting for Berkson errors is quantitatively important. Imposing the Slutsky shape constraint reduces sensitivity to Berkson errors.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01018
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Pass-Through of Minimum Wages into U.S. Retail Prices: Evidence from Supermarket Scanner Data,"Tobias Renkin, Claire Montialoux and Michael Siegenthaler","This paper estimates the pass-through of minimum wage increases into the prices of U.S. grocery and drug stores. We use high-frequency scanner data and leverage a large number of state-level increases in minimum wages between 2001 and 2012. We find that a 10% minimum wage hike translates into a 0.36% increase in the prices of grocery products. This magnitude is consistent with a full pass-through of cost increases into consumer prices. We show that price adjustments occur mostly in the three months following the passage of minimum wage legislation rather than after implementation, suggesting that pricing of groceries is forward-looking.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00981
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,"""It's Not You, It's Me"": Prices, Quality, and Switching in U.S.-China Trade Relationships",Ryan Monarch,"Costs from switching suppliers can affect prices by discouraging buyer movements from high- to low-cost sellers. This paper uses confidential data on U.S. importers and their Chinese exporters to investigate these costs. I find barriers to supplier adjustments: nearly half of importers keep their partner over time. Importers switch less if their supplier offers higher quality or provides lower prices. I propose and structurally estimate a dynamic discrete choice model to compute switching costs. Cost estimates are large, heterogeneous across products, and matter for trade prices: halving switching costs reduces the U.S.-China Import Price Index by 7.6%.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01015
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Impact of Social Networks on EITC Claiming Behavior,Riley Wilson,"Using the Social Connectedness Index (Bailey, Cao, Kuchler, Stroebel et al., 2018) to capture county-to-county Facebook linkages, I explore how county-level earned income tax credit (EITC) claiming behavior changes when the county's out-of-state social network is exposed to a newly implemented state EITC. Having more out-of-state friends face a state EITC shifts the composition of EITC claims toward more self-employment claiming. EITC-claiming households' income distribution also shifts, moving away from the EITC region with smaller credits, toward income levels that generate the largest EITC. This mimics the direct impacts of state-level EITC policies, consistent with social networks increasing information or salience about EITC policy.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00995
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Victim Incentives and Criminal Activity: Evidence from Bus Driver Robberies in Chile,Patricio Dominguez,"This paper analyzes crime as a function of the interaction between offenders and victims. I study robbery of bus drivers, a crime that remains common in cities throughout the world. Exploiting the timing of a Chilean public transportation reform and detailed administrative data, I show how victims' propensity to resist an attack can alter the level and nature of criminal activity. I also find a large decline in crime after the implementation of a technological innovation that eliminated cash transactions on buses. My results suggest a strong relationship between victim incentives, cash, and crime.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00989
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,School Desegregation and Black Teacher Employment,Owen Thompson,"Before the racial integration of schools in the southern United States, predominantly African American schools were staffed almost exclusively by African American teachers as well, and teaching constituted an extraordinarily large share of professional employment among southern Blacks. The large-scale desegregation of southern schools that occurred after passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act represented a potential threat to this employment base, and this paper estimates how student integration affected Black teacher employment. Using newly assembled archival data from 759 southern school districts observed between 1960 and 1972, I estimate that a school district transitioning from fully segregated to fully integrated education, which approximates the experience of the modal southern district in this period, led to a 41.7% reduction in Black teacher employment. Additional results, including event-study specifications and models with extensive controls for concurrent policy changes, strongly suggest that these employment reductions were a causal effect of integration and not due to school district self-selection into desegregation. To study the broader impacts of reduced teaching employment, I estimate race-specific changes in occupations and earnings in the decennial Censuses and find that displaced southern Black teachers either entered lower skill occupations within the South or migrated out of the region to continue teaching and that integration-induced displacement led to substantial earnings reductions.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00984
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Gender Promotion Gap: Evidence from Central Banking,"Laura Hospido, Luc Laeven and Ana Lamo","We examine gender differences in career progression and promotions using personnel data from the European Central Bank (ECB) during the period 2003-2017. A gender wage gap emerges within a few years of hiring, despite broadly similar entry conditions. We also find a gender promotion gap before 2010 when the ECB issued a public commitment to diversity. Following this change, the promotion gap disappears. Using data on promotion applications, we find a gender application bias, partly driven by preferences for competition. Following promotion, women perform better in terms of salary progression.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00988
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Unintended Consequences of Employer Credit Check Bans for Labor Markets,"Kristle Cortes, Andrew Glover and Murat Tasci","Over the past fifteen years, eleven states have restricted employers' access to the credit reports of job applicants. We estimate that county-level job vacancies have fallen by 5.5% in occupations affected by these laws relative to exempt occupations in the same counties and national-level vacancies for the same occupations. Cross-sectional heterogeneity suggests that employers use credit reports as signals of a worker's ability to perform the job: vacancies fall more in counties with a large share of subprime residents and less for occupations with other commonly available signals. Vacancies fall most for occupations involving routine tasks, suggesting that credit reports contain information relevant for these types of jobs.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01019
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Choosing Your Pond: Location Choices and Relative Income,Nicolas Bottan and Ricardo Perez-Truglia,"Do individuals care about their relative income? While this is a long-standing hypothesis, revealed-preference evidence remains elusive. We provide a unique test by studying residential choices: individuals often must choose between places with different income distributions, and as a result they ""choose"" their relative income. We conducted a field experiment with 1,080 senior medical students who participated in the National Resident Matching Program. We estimate their preferences by combining choice data, survey data on perceptions, and information-provision experiments. The evidence suggests that individuals care about their relative income and that these preferences differ across single and nonsingle individuals.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00991
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Effect of Labor Market Conditions at Entry on Workers' Long-Term Skills,Jaime Arellano-Bover,"Using data on adults' cognitive skills from nineteen countries, this paper shows that labor market conditions during the education-to-work transition affected workers' long-term skill development. Workers who faced higher unemployment rates at ages 18 to 25 have lower skills at ages 36 to 59. Unemployment rates at ages 26 to 35 do not have such an effect. Skill inequality is affected: those with less educated parents experience most of the negative effects. Using German panel data on skills, I document a mechanism related to heterogeneous skill development across firms: young workers at large firms experience higher skill growth than those at small firms.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01008
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,"Resource Discoveries, FDI Bonanzas, and Local Multipliers: Evidence from Mozambique",Gerhard Toews and Pierre-Louis Vézina,"We show that giant and unpredictable oil and gas discoveries trigger FDI bonanzas. Across developing countries, we document a 56% increase in FDI in the two years following a giant discovery. These booms are driven by new projects in sectors such as manufacturing, retail, services, and construction. To assess the job creation effects of one such FDI bonanza in Mozambique, we combine concurrent waves of household surveys and firm censuses and estimate the local job multiplier of FDI. Our estimates suggest that for each new FDI job, an additional 4.4 jobs are created locally, 2.1 of which are formal jobs.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00999
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Expectations with Endogenous Information Acquisition: An Experimental Investigation,"Andreas Fuster, Ricardo Perez-Truglia, Mirko Wiederholt and Basit Zafar","We use a survey experiment to generate direct evidence on how people acquire and process information. Participants can buy different information signals that could help them forecast future national home prices. We elicit their valuations and exogenously vary the cost of information. Participants put substantial value on their preferred signal and, when acquired, incorporate the signal in their beliefs. However, they disagree on which signal to buy. As a result, making information cheaper does not decrease the cross-sectional dispersion of expectations. We provide a model with costly acquisition and processing of information, which can match most of our empirical results.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00994
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Long-Run Saving Dynamics: Evidence from Unexpected Inheritances,Jeppe Druedahl and Alessandro Martinello,"We exploit inheritance episodes to provide novel causal evidence on the long-run effects of a large financial windfall on saving behavior. For identification, we combine a longitudinal panel of administrative wealth reports with variation in the timing of sudden, unexpected parental deaths. We show that after inheritance, net worth converges toward the path established before parental death, with only one-third of the initial windfall remaining after nine years. We interpret these findings through the lens of a generalized consumption-saving framework. To quantitatively replicate this behavior, life-cycle consumption models require impatient consumers and strong precautionary saving motives.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01004
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Self-Constrained Hand-to-Mouth,Michael Gelman,"Many studies have shown that consumption responds to the arrival of predictable income (excess sensitivity). This paper uses a buffer stock model of consumption to understand what causes excess sensitivity and to test which parameterization is consistent with empirical excess sensitivity estimates. Using high-frequency granular data from a personal finance app, I find that while liquidity constraints are a proximate cause, preferences are the ultimate cause of excess sensitivity. Furthermore, it finds that for feasible parameters, a quasi-hyperbolic version of the model is more consistent with the level of excess sensitivity relative to a standard exponential model.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01026
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Choice and Personal Responsibility: What Is a Morally Relevant Choice?,"Alexander Cappelen, Sebastian Fest, Erik Sørensen and Bertil Tungodden",The principle that people should be held personally responsible for the consequences of their choices is a fundamental moral ideal in Western societies. We report from a large-scale experimental study of how far-reaching this principle is for inequality acceptance. We show that third-party spectators violate minimal conditions for a morally relevant choice when making redistributive decisions for two workers. They accept more inequality when the workers have made nominal and forced choices than when brute luck is the source of inequality. We argue that our findings shed light on important current political debates about personal responsibility and redistributive policies.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01010
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Can Female Doctors Cure the Gender STEMM Gap? Evidence from Exogenously Assigned General Practitioners,"Julie Riise, Barton Willage and Alexander Willén","We use exogenously assigned general practitioners to study the effects of female role models on girls' educational outcomes. Girls who are exposed to female general practitioners are more likely to sort into male-dominated education programs in high school, most notably science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM). These effects persist as they enter college and select majors. The effects are larger for high-ability girls with low-educated mothers, suggesting that female role models improve intergenerational mobility and narrow the gifted gap. This demonstrates that role model effects in education need not involve individuals in the classroom but can arise due to everyday interactions with medical professionals.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00975
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,"What Drives the Gender Wage Gap? Examining the Roles of Sorting, Productivity Differences, Bargaining, and Discrimination","Isabelle Sin, Steven Stillman and Richard Fabling","As in other OECD countries, women in New Zealand earn substantially less than men with similar observable characteristics. In this paper, we use fifteen years of linked employer-employee data to examine different explanations for this gender wage gap. We find an overall gender wage gap between 20% and 28%, of which gender differences in sorting across occupations explain 9%, across industries 16% to 19%, and across firms 5% to 9%, respectively. The remaining within-firm gender wage gap is still between 13% and 17%. Around 5 percentage points of this are explained by women being less willing to bargain or less successful at bargaining to capture firm-specific rents. Gender differences in productivity also explain at most 4.5 percentage points of this remaining gap. These results suggest that taste discrimination is also important for explaining why women are paid less than their relative contribution to firm output. Across-industry and over-time variation in the gender wage-productivity gap further support this conclusion.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01000

The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Shocks versus Menu Costs: Patterns of Price Rigidity in an Estimated Multisector Menu-Cost Model,Erwan Gautier and Hervé Le Bihan,"Sectoral heterogeneity matters for monetary policy. Using CPI microdata, we estimate for 227 products a time-varying menu-cost model to investigate the quantitative relevance of this heterogeneity. We find a substantial degree of cross-sectoral heterogeneity in all structural parameters. Heterogeneity in the Calvo component of the pricing friction is, however, the main source of heterogeneity in price rigidity. Cross-sectoral heterogeneity amplifies the output effect of a monetary shock by a factor of about 2.5, compared to a single-sector model estimated with mean moments. Heterogeneity in the Calvo parameter plays a key role in this amplification.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00968

We find that a stable long-term inflation trend and a well-identified steep Phillips curve are consistent with the data, but they imply potential output declining since the new millennium and energy prices affecting headline inflation not only via the Phillips curve but also via an independent expectational channel.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00974
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Reflection Effect for Higher-Order Risk Preferences,Han Bleichrodt and Paul  van Bruggen,"Higher-order risk preferences are important determinants of economic behavior. We apply insights from behavioral economics: we measure higher-order risk preferences for pure gains and losses. We find a reflection effect not only for second-order risk preferences, as did Kahneman and Tversky (1979), but also for higher-order risk preferences: we find risk aversion, prudence and intemperance for gains and much more risk-loving preferences, imprudence and temperance for losses. These findings are at odds with a universal preference for combining good with bad or good with good, which previous results suggest may underlie higher-order risk preferences.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00980

Establishment-level data indicate faster growth in employment, wages, and corporate innovation after the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act's shock to the spread of innovation from universities in industries more closely related to the nearby university's innovative strengths. Federal research funding amplified the effect. University knowledge spillovers strengthen with geographic proximity, density, and local skills. Consistent with spatial equilibrium models, the growth effect is driven by nearby entry in university-linked industries, especially of multiunit expansions; these firms disproportionately partner with universities in RD, transfer IP, and innovate.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01027

The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Mission and the Bottom Line: Performance Incentives in a Multigoal Organization,"Xavier Gine, Ghazala Mansuri and Slesh A. Shrestha","We assess the role of monetary incentives in a mission-oriented organization by randomly assigning workers to one of two bonus schemes, incentivizing either the performance of a microcredit program (bottom line) or the empowerment of clients (mission). We find that the credit bonus improved credit-related outcomes but undermined the social mission, while the social bonus did not harm the bottom line. These results are consistent with a multitasking model with production spillovers or with prosocial behavior.

The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Employment Effects of Lump-Sum and Contingent Job Insurance Policies: Evidence from Brazil,Diogo G. C. Britto,"Lump-sum job displacement policies (e.g., severance pay) are often presented as a better alternative to contingent policies (e.g., unemployment insurance) in the context of developing countries, under the rationale that the former are less harmful to formal employment as they do not incentivize substitution from formal to informal jobs. First, this paper provides original evidence on the employment effects of lump-sum income in the context of a developing country with high labor informality. A regression discontinuity (RD) design, using Brazilian data, shows that a transfer equivalent to fifteen days of earnings (a) increases the duration out of a formal job by 1.9 weeks, (b) reduces monthly earnings in the next job by 1.6%, and (c) reduces total earnings in the formal labor market by 3.6% over a three-year period. Second, the paper studies the impact of a one-month extension in unemployment insurance (UI) on a comparable sample of displaced workers. UI is shown to have a stronger impact on the duration out of a formal job compared with a lump-sum transfer. In addition, a novel exercise matching administrative and survey data shows that 57% of the decrease in formal employment caused by UI is compensated by an increase in the incidence of informal employment. However, workers receiving the UI extension partially recover the initial employment loss over time in such a way that the adverse impact on employment over a three-year period is similar compared with the lump-sum transfer. Moreover, UI is found to be less harmful to reemployment wages, possibly because it improves workers' bargaining power as it offers insurance against the duration of joblessness. Overall, the UI extension is less detrimental to total earnings in the formal labor market over a three-year period. Hence, although these findings indicate that contingent job insurance policies have a stronger impact on the initial duration out of a formal job and indeed incentivize informal employment, they do not support the notion that lump-sum policies are less harmful to formal employment and earnings in the medium term.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00948

I show that the treatment coefficient is a convex combination of two parameters, which under certain conditions can be interpreted as the average treatment effects on the treated and untreated. The weights on these parameters are inversely related to the proportion of observations in each group. Reliance on these implicit weights can have serious consequences for applied work, as I illustrate with two well-known applications.

We investigate whether this stagnation was due to hysteresis effects from the Great Recession, a persistent negative output gap following the recession, or slower trend growth for other reasons. To do so, we develop a new Markov-switching time series model of output growth that accommodates two different types of recessions: those that permanently alter the level of real GDP and those with only temporary effects. We also account for structural change in trend growth. Estimates from our model suggest that the Great Recession generated a large, persistent negative output gap rather than any substantial hysteresis effects, with the economy eventually recovering to a lower trend path that appears to be due to a reduction in productivity growth that began prior to the onset of the Great Recession.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00957

A Field Test,Constanca Esteves-Sorenson and Robert Broce,"Economists have long been intrigued by an influential literature in psychology positing that monetary pay lowers performance on enjoyable tasks by crowding out agents' intrinsic interest in them. But typical experiments in this literature do not report a full set of performance metrics, which might reveal conflicting evidence on crowding out. Further, they may suffer from confounds. To evaluate these issues, we review over 100 prior tests and run a field experiment building on the canonical two-session test for crowding out wherein agents receive pay for an interesting activity in session 1 that is withdrawn unexpectedly in session 2. We test whether pay harms performance using a comprehensive set of performance measures, and if so, whether unmet pay expectations might also contribute to this decline. Our results on output, productivity and quits are most consistent with a standard economics model than with a crowding-out one. Additional, though more speculative, evidence suggests that unmet pay expectations may harm output quality.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00947

We find that the public disclosure caused an increase of 9 log points and the social recognition program 17 log points in the tax payments of agents exposed to the program. Our results suggest that such programs can be important policy levers to mobilize additional resources.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00929
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Long-Term Effect of Military Conscription on Personality and Beliefs,"Gabriela Ertola Navajas, Paula A. Lopez Villalba, Martín Rossi and Antonia Vazquez","We estimate the causal impact of military conscription on long-term beliefs and personality traits. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we exploit the conscription lottery in Argentina. We combine administrative data from the conscription lottery with data from a survey we designed on beliefs and personality traits. We find that men who were conscripted are more likely to adopt a military mind-set and that the effect is long lasting. Given the many people who go through military conscription, our results are useful for understanding how personality traits and beliefs are formed for a very salient part of the world's population.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00930
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,"Revealing ""Mafia Inc.""? Financial Crisis, Organized Crime, and the Birth of New Enterprises",Marco Le Moglie and Giuseppe Sorrenti,"We study the investment of organized crime in the legal economy. By using the shock induced on the Italian credit market by the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, we document how provinces with a high organized crime presence have been affected less by the crisis in terms of the establishment of new enterprises than provinces with a lower criminal infiltration. We provide evidence that the lower impact of the crisis is consistent with the presence of investments by organized crime in the legal economy. We corroborate this interpretation by comparing our results with the characterization made by the judicial authority of such investments.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00942
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Impact of Emergency Cash Assistance in a Pandemic: Experimental Evidence from Colombia,Juliana Londono-Velez and Pablo Querubin,"We study the impact of money on households during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, Colombia rolled out a new unconditional cash transfer (UCT) to 1 million households in poverty worth US$19 (PPP US$55.6) and paid every five to eight weeks. Using a randomized control trial and linked administrative and survey data, we find the UCT had positive (albeit modest) effects on measures of household well-being (e.g., financial health, food access). Moreover, the UCT boosted support for emergency assistance to households and firms during the crisis and promoted social cooperation. Finally, we explore the bottlenecks in expanding mobile money during a pandemic.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01043
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,Longer-Run Economic Consequences of Pandemics,"Oscar Jorda, Sanjay Singh and Alan Taylor","What are the medium- to long-term effects of pandemics? Do they differ from other economic disasters? We study major pandemics using rates of return on assets stretching back to the fourteenth century. Significant macroeconomic after-effects of pandemics persist for decades, with rates of return substantially depressed. The responses are in stark contrast to what happens after wars. Our findings also accord with wage and output responses, using more limited data, and are consistent with the neoclassical growth model: capital is destroyed in wars but not in pandemics; pandemics instead may induce more labor scarcity or more precautionary savings, or both.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01042
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Cost of Privacy: Welfare Effects of the Disclosure of COVID-19 Cases,"David Argente, Chang-Tai Hsieh and Munseob Lee","South Korea publicly disclosed detailed location information of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19. We quantify the effect of public disclosure on the transmission of the virus and economic losses in Seoul. The change in commuting patterns due to public disclosure lowers the number of cases by 60,000 and the number of deaths by 2,000 in Seoul over two years. Compared to a city-wide lockdown that results in the same number of cases over two years as the disclosure scenario, the economic cost of such a lockdown is almost four times higher.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01095
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2022,The Effect of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic on Income Inequality: Evidence from Italy,Sergio Galletta and Tommaso Giommoni,"We estimate the effect of the 1918 influenza pandemic on income inequality in Italian municipalities. Our identification strategy exploits the exogenous diffusion of influenza across municipalities due to the presence of infected soldiers on leave from World War I operations. The measures of income inequality come from newly digitized historical administrative records on taxpayer incomes. We show that in the short and medium run, income inequality is higher in municipalities more afflicted by the pandemic. The effect is mostly explained by an increase in the share of income held by the rich to the detriment of the other strata of the population.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01075
