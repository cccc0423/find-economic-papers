Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Introduction to a Special Issue in Honor of Robert A. Moffitt,Michael Keane and James Ziliak,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/733438
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,"Earnings, Marriage, and the Variance of Family Income by Age, Gender, and Cohort","Joseph G. Altonji, Daniel Giraldo-Páez, Disa Hynsjo and Ivan Vidangos","For birth cohorts 1935–44, 1945–62, and 1964–74, we estimate the contribution of education; permanent heterogeneity in wage rates, employment, and hours; labor market shocks; spouse characteristics and shocks; nonlabor income shocks; and marital histories to the age profiles of the variance of family income per adult equivalent. Education and employment heterogeneity are key sources of the rise in variance with age and across cohorts. Wage heterogeneity is important at all ages. Own characteristics and shocks matter more for men than women, while spouse characteristics and shocks matter more for women. Gender differences have declined across cohorts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734390
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Interpreting Cohort Profiles of Life Cycle Earnings Volatility,"Richard Blundell, Christopher R. Bollinger, Charles Hokayem and James Ziliak","We present new estimates of earnings volatility over time and the life cycle for men and women by race and human capital, using Social Security earnings linked to the Current Population Survey. From the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, there is a strong negative trend in earnings volatility driven by a decline in transitory variance. From the mid-1990s, there is relative stability in trends of male earnings volatility due to an increase in the variance of permanent shocks. Cohort analyses indicate that earnings volatility is U-shaped, driven by large permanent shocks early and later in the life cycle.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732667
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Workers’ Perceptions of Earnings Growth and Employment Risk,Gizem Kosar and Wilbert van der Klaauw,"In addition to realized earnings and employment shocks, forward-looking individuals are presumed to condition their consumption and labor supply decisions on their subjective beliefs about future labor market risks. This paper uses rich panel data to document considerable individual heterogeneity in earnings growth expectations and in the perceived likelihood of voluntary and involuntary job exits. We examine how expectations evolve over the working life and business cycle and how they covary with macroeconomic expectations and personal experiences. While largely consistent with patterns in realized outcomes, our findings highlight the unanticipated nature of the pandemic recession and the ensuing resignation wave.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734088
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Family Income Dynamics 1970–2018: Putting the Pieces Together,"Ji-Liang Shiu, Sisi Zhang and Peter Gottschalk","This paper examines the driving forces of family income dynamics by developing a unified framework to estimate permanent and transitory variation in head earnings, spouse earnings, and transfer income, as well as permanent and transitory correlations between these income sources. A complete decomposition using the PSID 1970–2018 shows that transitory variation in head earnings alone accounts for more than half of the total family income inequality. Insurance against transitory shocks to head earnings comes primarily from transfer income rather than spouse earnings. Both permanent and transitory variations in spouse earnings have an equalizing effect on family income inequality.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732769
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,The Association between the Volatility of Income and Life Expectancy in the United States,"Anna L. Ziff, Emily Wiemers and V. Joseph Hotz","We examine the relationship between income volatility and life expectancy in mid-sized US commuting zones between 2006 and 2014. We use a commercial dataset, InfoUSA, to measure income volatility, which we link to estimates of life expectancy by gender, county, race, and income. We find that higher income volatility in a county is associated with lower life expectancy but only at the bottom of the income distribution and primarily for non-Hispanic Whites. Though we cannot extrapolate our findings to individual-level relationships, we do link them to existing literatures on place-based differences in mortality and the relationship between volatility and health.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732668
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Robust Inference for the Frisch Labor Supply Elasticity,Michael Keane and Timothy Neal,"Many studies estimate the Frisch elasticity via two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression of hours changes on wage changes. However, 2SLS suffers from a power asymmetry problem that makes estimates far away from ordinary least squares appear spuriously imprecise. Hence, it is difficult for t-tests to detect a positive Frisch elasticity. We illustrate the problem using NLSY97 data. We estimate an elasticity of 0.60 for young men, but the t-test indicates that it is insignificant. The Anderson-Rubin (AR) test, which avoids the power asymmetry problem, indicates that it is highly significant. We argue that the AR test should be widely adopted in lieu of the t-test in instrumental variable applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732771
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Distributional Effects of Local Minimum Wages: A Spatial Job Search Approach,Weilong Zhang and Petra E. Todd,"This paper develops a spatial general equilibrium job search model to study the effects of local and universal minimum wage policies on employment, wages, job postings, vacancies, migration, and welfare. Workers search for jobs locally and in neighboring areas, deciding whether to migrate or commute after receiving remote offers. The model, estimated using ACS and QWI data, reliably forecasts commuting responses to city minimum wage hikes. Simulations show that low-skill (noncollege) workers benefit from local wage increases up to $12.50. The greatest per capita welfare gain for all workers is achieved by a $15.25 universal minimum wage.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734391
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,The Impact of the Level and Timing of Parental Resources on Child Development and Intergenerational Mobility,"Sadegh Eshaghnia, James Heckman and Rasmus Landersø","This study explores relationships between parental resource trajectories and child development and their implications for intergenerational mobility. By modifying the child skill formation technology to incorporate new skills emerging during adolescence, we analyze the importance of the timing of family resources on life outcomes, educational attainment, and participation in crime. Parental financial resources partially offset deficiencies in nonpecuniary inputs to children’s human capital. Estimates of the intergenerational influence on child outcomes are strongly influenced by the choice of lifetime versus snapshot parental income measures. The most predictive ages of children when family resources are measured vary by the outcome analyzed.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732677
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,A Generalized Model of Misclassification Errors and Labor Force Dynamics,"Shuaizhang Feng, Yingyao Hu and Jiandong Sun","We study the US labor market transitions using a latent variable approach, explicitly modeling the persistent misclassification process and the non-Markovian nature of the underlying true labor force dynamics. A closed-form global identification for misclassification probabilities and labor transition probabilities is established through an eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition. Contrary to existing studies, our empirical results suggest that the observed data have understated the true mobility in labor force statuses after we account for persistence in both the misclassification errors and the latent true labor force dynamics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732518
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Inference with Imputed Data: The Allure of Making Stuff Up,Charles F. Manski,Incomplete observability of data generates an identification problem. What one can learn about a population parameter depends on the assumptions one finds credible. Rubin has promoted random multiple imputation (RMI) as a general way to deal with missing values. The recommendation has been influential to researchers who seek a simple fix to the nuisance of missing data. This paper provides a transparent assessment of the mix of Bayesian and frequentist thinking used by Rubin to argue for RMI. It evaluates random imputation to replace missing outcome or covariate data when the objective is to learn a conditional expectation.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732521
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,"Family Law Effects on Divorce, Fertility, and Child Investment","Meta Brown, Christopher Flinn and Joseph Mullins","To assess the child welfare impact of policies governing divorced parenting, such as child support orders, child custody assignments, and marital dissolution standards, one must consider their influence not only on the divorce rate but also on spouses’ fertility choices and child investments. We develop a model of fertility, parenting, and divorce, from which we derive estimates of parental preferences and a child cognitive ability production function, using data on parental time allocation, children’s cognitive attainment, and realized fertility and divorce. Family policies that reduce divorce are simulated to have significant negative impacts on both fertility and child development.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/734568
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,"Changing Families: Family Relationships, Parental Decisions, and Child Development",Marc Chan and Kai Liu,"We develop a tractable economic framework to study the impact of family structure on children’s cognitive and noncognitive outcomes. Combining a sequential choice model with panel data on both biological parents, irrespective of subsequent relationship status, and on social fathers and a set of exclusion restrictions, we identify the unobserved heterogeneity of biological families and examine child skill formation via a control function approach. Time investments made by high-ability fathers have positive returns, whereas those made by low-ability fathers can generate negative returns. Policies that incentivize family formation should consider the quality of the fathers whom mothers are cohabited with.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732520
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Learning the Right Skill: Vocational Curricula and Returns to Skills,"Femke Cnossen, Matloob Piracha and Guy Tchuente","Using text data from curricula of the entire Dutch vocational education system, we extract verbs and nouns to measure basic cognitive and cross-functional skills, such as social, technical, and resource management skills. This method allows us to uncover, at a fine-grained level, the skills middle-educated students learn at school. We then estimate the returns to these skills. Results show that resource management and social skills have the highest return. Importantly, the returns to skills are strongly conditional on sorting mechanisms. Our results fit in the literature that highlights the demand for complex interactive skills in environments that require more coordination.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730123
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Firm Heterogeneity in Skill Returns,"Michael J. Böhm, Khalil Esmkhani and Giovanni Gallipoli","We quantify firm heterogeneity in skill returns and present direct evidence of worker-firm complementarities. Within a model of firms’ demand for cognitive and noncognitive attributes, we show that identification depends on the availability of skill measures. Linking administrative data to test scores, we document worker sorting and convex earnings-skill relationships. We find that (1) both skills’ returns vary substantially across employers and correlate weakly within firms; (2) workers with large endowments of a skill populate firms with higher returns to it, and sorting intensifies with the cross-sectional dispersion of returns; and (3) complementarities and sorting significantly influence the earnings distribution.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/729103
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Recidivism and Neighborhood Institutions: Evidence from the Rise of the Evangelical Church in Chile,Andrés Barrios-Fernández and Jorge García-Hombrados,"This paper uses administrative data from Chile to provide causal evidence that the local institutions of the neighborhood in which inmates live after prison impact recidivism. Indeed, the opening of an evangelical church nearby reduces 12-month reincarceration rates among property crime offenders by 11 percentage points (18%). Similarly, the opening of nongovernmental organizations helping their beneficiaries to improve their earnings potential or overcome alcohol and drug abuse problems reduce 12-month reincarceration rates by 11 and 10 percentage points, respectively. These results suggest that giving recently released inmates access to local support networks could play an important role in reducing recidivism.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730119
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Understanding the Effects of Granting Work Permits to Undocumented Immigrants,"Ferran Elias, Joan Monras and Javier Vázquez-Grenno","We study the regularization of 600,000 non-EU immigrants by the unexpectedly elected Spanish government following the terrorist attacks of 2004. By comparing non-EU to EU immigrants, we estimate that the policy did not lead to magnet effects. We then show that immigrant formal employment increased, while that of natives was not affected. However, there was a decrease in informal employment of both native and immigrant low-skilled workers. We document that tax revenues increased by around 4,000 euros per regularized immigrant—with no evidence of increased public expenditures. The evidence also suggests that the policy increased labor market opportunities for immigrants.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730122
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,"Health of Parents, Their Children’s Labor Supply, and the Role of Migrant Care Workers","Wolfgang Frimmel, Martin Halla, Jörg Paetzold and Julia Schmieder","We estimate the impact of parental health on adult children’s labor market outcomes. We focus on health shocks that increase care dependency abruptly. Our estimation strategy exploits the variation in the timing of shocks across treated families. Empirical results based on administrative data show a significant negative impact on the labor market activities of children. This effect is more pronounced for daughters and for children who live close to their parents. Informal caregiving is the most likely mechanism. The effect is significantly muted after a liberalization of the formal care market, which sharply increased the supply of foreign care workers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/729102
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Immigrating into a Recession: Evidence from Family Migrants to the United States,"Toman Barsbai, Andreas Steinmayr and Christoph Winter","We analyze the impact of economic conditions at arrival on the economic integration of family-sponsored migrants in the United States. A 1 percentage point higher unemployment rate at arrival decreases annual wage income by 4% in the short run and 2% in the longer run. The loss in wage income results primarily from lower hourly wages due to occupational downgrading. Migrant and family networks help mitigate the negative labor market effects. Migrants who arrive during a recession take up occupations with higher concentrations of fellow countrypeople and are more likely to reside with family members, potentially reducing their geographical mobility.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730121
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,The Search for Good Jobs: Evidence from a Six-Year Field Experiment in Uganda,"Oriana Bandiera, Vittorio Bassi, Robin Burgess, Imran Rasul, Munshi Sulaiman and Anna Vitali","There are 420 million young people in Africa today, and only one in three has a regular salaried job. We study how two common labor market interventions—vocational training and matching—affect the job search behavior of young workers. We do so by means of a field experiment tracking young job seekers for 6 years in Uganda’s main cities. Vocational training amplifies the job seekers’ initial optimism, leading them to search more intensively and toward high-quality firms. Adding matching has the opposite effect, plausibly because of low callback rates. These differences affect labor market outcomes in the long run.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728429
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Occupational Licensing and Labor Market Fluidity,Morris M. Kleiner and Ming Xu,"We show that occupational licensing has significant negative effects on labor market fluidity, defined as cross-occupation mobility, and positive effects on wage growth. We find that occupational licensing represents a barrier to entry for both nonemployed workers and employed ones. The effect is more prominent for employed workers than those entering from nonemployment. We also find that average wage growth is higher for licensed workers than nonlicensed workers. We find significant heterogeneity in the licensing effect across different occupation groups. These results hold across various data sources, time spans, and indicators of being licensed.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730120
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Permanent Residency and Refugee Immigrants’ Skill Investment,"Jacob Arendt, Christian Dustmann and Hyejin Ku","We analyze an immigration reform in Denmark that tightened refugee immigrants’ eligibility criteria for permanent residency to incentivize their labor market attachment and acquisition of local language skills. Contrary to what the reform intended, the overall employment of those affected decreased, while their average language proficiency remained largely unchanged. This was caused by a disincentive effect, where individuals with low prereform labor market performance reduced their labor supply. Our findings suggest that stricter permanent residency rules, rather than incentivizing refugees’ skill investment, may decrease the efforts of those who believe they cannot meet the new requirements.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726433
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Effect of Business Uncertainty on Turnover,"Omar Bamieh, Decio Coviello, Andrea Ichino and Nicola Persico","We document a causal relationship between business uncertainty and workforce management at the firm level by leveraging litigation-generated quasi-experimental variation in business uncertainty. The causal effects of business uncertainty on turnover, hiring, and separations are of the expected negative direction and of sizable magnitude. These consequences are stronger among firms that operate in sectors in which business uncertainty is intrinsically higher and can be attributed to the effect of regulation-induced business risk on normal operations. In particular, employee turnover, hiring, and separations are ratcheted down to reduce the risk of additional wrongful termination lawsuits.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/727201
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Long-Term Consequences of Teaching Gender Roles: Evidence from Desegregating Industrial Arts and Home Economics in Japan,Hiromi Hara and Núria Rodríguez-Planas,"This paper explores whether a 1990 reform that eliminated gender-segregated and gender normative industrial arts and home economics classes in Japanese junior high schools led to behavioral changes two decades later, when students were married and in their early 40s. Using a regression discontinuity design and Japanese time use data from 2016, we find that the reform narrowed gender gaps in weekend home production and job-related activities by increasing (decreasing) men’s engagement in traditionally female (male) activities, reduced the gender income gap by increasing women’s access to better jobs, delayed men’s fertility, and relaxed women’s attitudes toward traditional gender roles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728428
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,The Direct and Spillover Effects of Large-Scale Affirmative Action at an Elite Brazilian University,"Cecilia Machado, Germán Reyes and Evan Riehl",We examine the effects of an affirmative action policy at an elite Brazilian university that reserved 45% of admission slots for Black and low-income students. We find that marginally admitted students who enrolled through the affirmative action tracks experienced a 14% increase in early-career earnings. But the adoption of affirmative action also caused a large decrease in earnings for the university’s most highly ranked students. We present evidence that the negative spillover effects on highly ranked students’ earnings were driven by both a reduction in human capital accumulation and a decline in the value of networking.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726385
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,The Effect of Classroom Rank on Learning throughout Elementary School: Experimental Evidence from Ecuador,"Pedro Carneiro, Yyannu Cruz-Aguayo, Francesca Salvati and Norbert Schady","We study the impact of classroom rank on children’s learning using a unique experiment from Ecuador. Within each school, students were randomly assigned to classrooms in every grade between kindergarten and sixth grade. Students with the same ability can have different classroom ranks because of the (random) peer composition of their classroom. Children with higher beginning-of-grade classroom rank have significantly higher test scores at the end of that grade. The impact of classroom rank is larger for younger children and grows over time. Higher classroom rank also improves executive function, child happiness, and teacher perceptions of student ability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/727515
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Dynamic Effort Choice in High School: Costs and Benefits of an Academic Track,Olivier De Groote,"I investigate high school tracking policies using a dynamic discrete choice model of study programs and unobserved effort. I estimate the model using data from Flanders (Belgium) and perform an ex ante evaluation of a policy that encourages underperforming students to switch to less academically oriented programs. This reduces grade retention by a third and dropout by 11%. Although it decreases college enrollment, the decrease in college graduation is small and insignificant. I also show that modeling effort is important; otherwise, smaller decreases in grade retention and dropout and larger decreases in college enrollment and graduation would be predicted.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726702
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Computers as Stepping Stones? Technological Change and Equality of Labor Market Opportunities,"Melanie Arntz, Cäcilia Lipowski, Guido Neidhöfer and Ulrich Zierahn-Weilage","This paper analyzes whether technological change improves equality of labor market opportunities by increasing the returns to skills relative to the returns to parental background. We find that in Germany during the 1990s, the introduction of computer technologies improved the access to technology-adopting occupations for workers with low-educated parents and reduced their wage penalty within these occupations. We also show that this significantly contributed to a decline in the overall wage penalty experienced by workers from disadvantaged parental backgrounds over this time period. Competing mechanisms, such as skill-specific labor supply shocks and skill upgrading, do not explain these findings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/727490
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Matching across Markets: An Economic Analysis of Cross-Border Marriage,So Yoon Ahn,"Severe gender imbalances coupled with stark income differences across countries are driving an increase in cross-border marriages in many Asian countries. I theoretically and empirically study who marries whom and how couples allocate marital surplus in Taiwanese and Vietnamese marriage markets. I find that Taiwanese men are selected from the middle level of the human capital distribution and that Vietnamese women are positively selected for cross-border marriages. I show that changes in the costs of cross-border marriage affect the welfare of Taiwanese and Vietnamese who do not participate in cross-border marriages by altering marriage rates, matching partners, and intrahousehold allocations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728359
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,In-Kind Housing Transfers and Labor Supply: A Structural Approach,Ning Zhang,"This paper estimates a dynamic life cycle model to study the long-term impacts of housing vouchers on employment and examine how policy reforms affect labor supply and well-being. I show that the current program decreases female employment by 17% and male employment by 7%. Compared with the current program, a proposed reform that provides every recipient with a flat-rate subsidy increases female employment by 4% and leads to higher welfare. Policies that offer a lower subsidy to a larger population decrease employment by 3%–4% and increase welfare. Time-limited subsidies increase female employment by 4% and improve overall welfare.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/727839
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,How Credible Is the Credibility Revolution?,Kevin Lang,"Economists analyzing a well-conducted randomized controlled trial or natural experiment and finding a statistically significant effect conclude that the null of no effect is unlikely to be true. But how frequently is this conclusion warranted? The answer depends on the proportion of tested nulls that are true and the test's power. I model the distribution of t-statistics in leading economics journals. Using my preferred model, 65% of narrowly rejected null hypotheses and 41% of all rejected null hypotheses with |t|<10 are likely to be false rejections. For the null to have only a .05 probability of being true requires a t of 5.48.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732772
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Effects of Confidential Access to Oral Contraception in Late Adolescence on Work and Earnings,Randy Cragun,"This article uses state-specific timing of legal changes and data from the Current Population Survey and National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women to estimate effects of confidential access to the pill in late adolescence on earnings, labor force participation, and human capital accumulation over the life cycle, finding no evidence of effects. These results are contrary to past research, which imposed a restriction on the regression model that this article shows explains the past results.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726383
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Physicians Treating Physicians: Relational and Informational Advantages in Treatment and Survival,"Stacey H. Chen, Jennjou Chen, Hongwei Chuang and Tzu-Hsin Lin","We use the medical specialties of physician-patients with advanced cancer to study the role of knowledge versus networks in treatment choices and patient survival by matching comparable patients with doctors and admission periods to control unobserved doctor quality. Physician-patients are less likely to have surgery, radiation, or checkups and more likely to receive targeted therapy, spend more on drugs, enjoy a higher survival rate, and spend less on coinsurance than nonphysician-patients. Knowledge mechanisms play a crucial role because the network effect explains some, but not all, patterns. For less informed physician-patients, possessing a network is equivalent to reducing medical knowledge.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725596
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Does Job Search Assistance Reduce Unemployment? Evidence on Displacement Effects and Mechanisms,"Maria Cheung, Johan Egebark, Anders Forslund, Lisa Laun, Magnus Rödin and Johan Vikström","Using a two-level randomized experiment, we find that job search assistance (JSA) reduces unemployment among the treated but also creates displacement effects. Analyses of mechanisms show that vacancy referrals from caseworkers to job seekers explain the positive effects for the treated by helping the job seekers apply to the most relevant jobs earlier. We also find that the overall assessment of JSA hinges on how the displacement effects hit the labor market and to what extent firms react by opening new vacancies. The displacement is larger in weak labor markets, and we find no displacement of resources.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726384
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Marginalized and Overlooked? Minoritized Groups and the Adoption of New Scientific Ideas,Wei Cheng and Bruce Weinberg,"The diffusion and use of new ideas is critical for producing innovations and realizing their potential. We explore how characteristics of innovators and potential adopters affect the adoption of important, new scientific ideas in networks. Using rich data on biomedical researchers and their networks, natural language processing, and a novel two-way fixed effects strategy, we find that new ideas introduced by female scientists are underutilized for two reasons. First, female innovators are less connected than men. Second, at short network distances, researchers (especially men) adopt women’s ideas less. Similar gaps hold for underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725551
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,"Promotions, Adverse Selection, and Efficiency",Michael Waldman and Zhenda Yin,"We consider how adverse selection affects the efficiency of turnover and postturnover job assignments. In the model, when a high-ability worker is not promoted at the worker’s current employer because of a lack of available managerial openings, it is efficient for the worker to move to a firm seeking a high-ability worker to promote. But this type of turnover does not occur given asymmetric information and adverse selection. We show that up-or-out contracts can be an efficient response to this inefficiency, where our analysis matches several observations concerning real-world promotion decisions and practices related to up-or-out.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726065
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,Social Transfers and Spatial Distortions,Mark Colas and Robert McDonough,"US social transfer programs vary substantially across states, incentivizing households to locate in states with more generous transfer programs. Furthermore, transfer formulas often decrease in income, thereby rewarding low-income households for living in low-paying cities. We quantify these distortions by combining a spatial equilibrium model with a detailed model of transfer programs in the United States. The current system leads to locational inefficiency of 4.88% of total transfer spending. A reform that both harmonizes transfer policies across states and indexes household income to local average earnings reduces this inefficiency by more than 60% while preserving the programs’ means-tested nature.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725873
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,The Impact of the Retirement Slowdown on the US Youth Labor Market,Paul Mohnen,"Exploiting cross–commuting zone differences in age composition among the old, this paper estimates the impact of retirements on youth labor market outcomes over the period 1980–2017. In commuting zones where fewer workers retire because of the initial age structure, there is no evidence of significant effects on youth employment, but the share of younger workers in high-skill jobs declines, while the share of younger workers in low-skill jobs rises. Fewer retirements also leads to declining youth wages and lower job mobility. This suggests that the retirement slowdown in recent decades has contributed to deteriorating early-career outcomes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725874
Journal of Labor Economics,2025,The Intergenerational Effects of the Vietnam Draft on Risky Behaviors,Monica Deza and Alvaro Mezza,"We exploit the natural experiment provided by the Vietnam lottery draft to evaluate the intergenerational effects of fathers’ draft eligibility on children’s propensity to engage in risky behaviors during adolescence using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. Draft eligibility increases measures of substance use, increases intensity of use, decreases age of initiation—particularly for marijuana—and increases measures of delinquency. We also show that draft eligibility led to changes in parenting that are conducive to these risky behaviors among children: it affects paternal parenting styles and attitudes toward the respondent, environmental aspects, and even maternal factors. Results are robust to alternative specifications and falsification diagnostics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725595
