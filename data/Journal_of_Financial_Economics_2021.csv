Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Dissecting bankruptcy frictions,"Winston Dou, Lucian A. Taylor, Wei Wang and Wenyu Wang","How efficient is corporate bankruptcy in the United States? Two frictions, asymmetric information and conflicts of interest among creditors, can cause several inefficiencies: excess liquidation, excess continuation, and excess delay. We find large bankruptcy inefficiencies, mainly due to excess delay. Eliminating information asymmetries would increase average total payouts by 4%, and eliminating conflicts of interest would increase them by 18% more. Without these frictions, 14% more cases would be resolved pre-court, and court cases would be 73% shorter. With less delay, bankruptcy’s indirect costs would be much lower. In contrast, inefficiencies from excess liquidation and excess continuation are quite small.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002841
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Failing to forecast rare events,Philip Bond and James Dow,"Do more talented traders prefer to bet on and against rare events or common events? Bets on rare events include out of the money options. Bets against rare events include the carry trade and investment grade bonds. In a model where traders specialize, equilibrium pricing reflects trading ability: A market with more skilled traders has a larger bid ask spread. We show that lower skill traders bet on and against rare events, while higher skill traders bet on and against frequent events, leading to higher bid-ask spreads in common event assets, and reducing financial markets’ ability to predict rare events.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002981
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Is there a risk-return tradeoff in the corporate bond market? Time-series and cross-sectional evidence,"Jennie Bai, Turan G. Bali and Quan Wen","We provide time-series and cross-sectional evidence on the significance of a risk-return tradeoff in the bond and equity markets. We find a significantly positive intertemporal relation between expected return and risk in the bond market. We also propose novel measures of systematic and idiosyncratic risk for individual corporate bonds and find a significantly positive cross-sectional relation between systematic risk and expected bond returns, whereas there is no significant link between idiosyncratic risk and future bond returns. We provide an explanation for the significance of systematic (idiosyncratic) risk based on different investor preferences and informational frictions in the bond (equity) market.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001835
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Optimal financing with tokens,"Sebastian Gryglewicz, Simon Mayer and Erwan Morellec","We develop a model in which a start-up firm issues tokens to finance a digital platform, which creates agency conflicts between platform developers and outsiders. We show that token financing is preferred to equity financing unless the platform expects strong cash flows, has large financing needs, or faces severe agency conflicts. Tokens are characterized by their utility features, facilitating transactions, and security features, granting cash flow rights. While security features trigger endogenous network effects and spur platform adoption, they also dilute developers’ equity stake and incentives so that the optimal level of security features decreases with agency conflicts and financing needs.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001860
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Core earnings: New data and evidence,"Ethan Rouen, Eric C. So and Charles C.Y. Wang","Using a novel dataset, we show that components of firms’ GAAP earnings stemming from ancillary business activities or transitory shocks are significant in frequency and magnitude. These components have grown over time and are dispersed across various sections of the 10-K. Excluding them from GAAP earnings yields a core earnings measure that distinguishes between the recurring and non-recurring components of net income and forecasts future performance. Analysts and market participants are slow to impound these earnings components’ implications, particularly the amounts disclosed in the footnotes. Trading strategies that exploit non-core earnings produce abnormal returns of 8% per year.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001550

As predicted by the model, we find that the recovery rate at emergence from bankruptcy on all of the firm’s debt taken together is increasing in the pre-bankruptcy share of private debt in all debt. We further find evidence consistent with a two-threshold model in which private debtholders force default in some cases and shareholders default strategically in others.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002415
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Spillover effects in empirical corporate finance,"Tobias Berg, Markus Reisinger and Daniel Streitz","Despite their importance, the discussion of spillover effects in empirical research often misses the rigor dedicated to endogeneity concerns. We analyze a broad set of workhorse models of firm interactions and show that spillovers naturally arise in many corporate finance settings. This has important implications for the estimation of treatment effects: (i) even with random treatment, spillovers lead to a complicated bias; (ii) fixed effects can exacerbate the spillover-induced bias. We propose simple diagnostic tools for empirical researchers and illustrate our guidance in an application.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001690

Replication yields ambiguous evidence within a unified testing framework that accounts for p-hacking. Out-of-sample tests reveal strong and robust presence of the large majority of global factor premiums, with limited out-of-sample decay of the premiums. We find global factor premiums to be generally unrelated to market, downside, or macroeconomic risks in the 217 years of data. These results reveal significant global factor premiums that present a challenge to traditional asset pricing theories.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21003007
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Does target firm insider trading signal the target's synergy potential in mergers and acquisitions?,Inho Suk and Mengmeng Wang,"We find that the acquirer's (1) abnormal returns at merger and acquisition (M&A) announcements and (2) long-term abnormal returns after acquisitions increase with target firm insiders’ net purchase ratios. Further, acquisition synergies, measured as the (1) acquirer-target combined cumulative abnormal returns at M&A announcements and (2) changes in three-year operating performance after acquisitions, increase with target insider net purchase ratios. Notwithstanding, targets with higher insider net purchase ratios receive higher takeover premiums. Overall, our findings suggest that, even under the SEC's “short-swing rule,” target insider trading prior to the M&A announcement serves as a credible signal for acquisition outcomes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002312

The long-run credit scores and default rates of MPL borrowers are especially worse when the MPL platforms provide less information to MPL investors, when MPL borrowers are benchmarked against relationship bank borrowers, and for one-time MPL borrowers as compared to repeat MPL borrowers. Overall, our results suggest that MPL lenders face greater information asymmetries with respect to their borrowers than traditional banks.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002713

Our approach accounts for the data sample being unrepresentative of the population distribution of regimes. We find that (i) the term structure of expected equity dividend strip returns is downward sloping in recessions and upward sloping in expansions, and (ii) the unconditional term structure of expected equity returns is positively sloped. Our estimation shows that the sample unrepresentativeness induces a downward bias in the estimate of the equity term structure slope.

Journal of Financial Economics,2021,"Labor leverage, coordination failures, and aggregate risk",Matthieu Bouvard and Adolfo de Motta,"This paper studies an economy in which demand spillovers make firms’ production decisions strategic complements. Firms choose their operating leverage trading off higher fixed costs for lower variable costs. Operating leverage governs firms’ exposures to an aggregate labor productivity shock. In equilibrium, firms exhibit excessive operating leverage because they do not internalize that an economy with higher aggregate operating leverage is more likely to fall into a recession following a negative productivity shock. Welfare losses coming from firms’ failure to coordinate production are amplified by suboptimal risk-taking, which magnifies the impact of productivity shocks onto aggregate output.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21003068
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Informed trading in government bond markets,"Robert Czech, Shiyang Huang, Dong Lou and Tianyu Wang","Using comprehensive administrative data from the UK, we examine trading by different investor types in government bond markets. Our sample covers virtually all secondary market trading in gilts and contains detailed information on each transaction, including the identities of both counterparties. We find that hedge funds’ daily trading positively forecasts gilt returns in the following one to five days, which is then fully reversed in the following month. A part of this short-term return predictability is due to hedge funds’ ability to predict other investors’ future demand. Mutual fund trading also positively predicts gilt returns, but over a longer horizon of one to two months. This return pattern does not revert in the following year and is partly due to mutual funds’ ability to forecast changes in short-term interest rates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002427

I measure cooperation using arrangements between securities regulators that enable enhanced cross-border enforcement, better regulatory decisions, and reduced compliance obligations for cross-border activities. These arrangements-formed at different times for different country pairs-are associated with an 11% increase in cross-border investment. I find similar increases using other proxies for market integration. Cross-border investment and market integration thus depend, in part, on regulators working together to extend legal and institutional capacities across borders.

To explore this possibility, we use administrative data for federal student borrowers linked to tax records and a sharp discontinuity generated by the timing of a student's 24th birthday, which induces a jump in federal support. We estimate a corresponding increase in homeownership, with larger effects among those most financially constrained, and find supplemental evidence of lagged marriage and fertility effects. Analysis of earnings, savings, and heterogeneity favors liquidity over human capital in explaining the results.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2100163X

Estimation is challenging because rumors may be spread on purpose or emerge accidentally while transaction values are only observable for completed deals and no regulation requires to disclose them. We use indirect inference to overcome these challenges. We find that (a) M&A rumors are deal breakers, (b) rumored but closed deals have higher transaction values, and (c) the combined economic impact of (a) and (b) is negative: in expectation rumors destroy about 32% of transaction value.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2100194X

Similar to the case for equity IPOs, the evidence shows bookbuilding theories help explain the CB offering price. In particular, CB price updates reduce underwriters’ pricing errors. The partial adjustment phenomenon exists, and underwriters propose a lower initial price in cases of greater uncertainty. However, the CB price update has a large mean value and is smaller for lower-rated offerings, indicating part of the CB price update is unrelated to investors’ information production.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2100307X
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Why are corporate payouts so high in the 2000s?,Kathleen Kahle and René M.

We find that an increase in aggregate corporate income accounts for 37% of the increase in aggregate annual payouts, and an increase in the payout rate accounts for 63%. Firms have higher payout rates in the 2000s not only because they are older, larger, and have more free cash flow, but also because they pay out more of their free cash flow. Though firms spend less on capital expenditures in the 2000s than before, capital expenditures decrease similarly for firms with payouts and for firms without.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002907
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Firm leverage and employment dynamics,Xavier Giroud and Holger M. Mueller,"We examine the dynamic relation between firm leverage buildups and real economic activity using U.S. establishment-, firm-, and region-level data. We find that buildups in firm leverage are predictably associated with boom-bust growth cycles: employment grows in the short run but declines in the medium run. While firm leverage buildups are correlated with firm-level expansions, they continue to predict negative future employment growth if we control for firm-level expansions. Buildups in firm leverage predict a tightening of future firm-level financing constraints, and they only predict negative future employment growth if the level of firm leverage is sufficiently high, suggesting that the dynamic relation between firm leverage buildups and employment growth operates through a financial fragility channel. Our results have aggregate implications: regions with larger buildups in firm leverage experience stronger regional boom-bust growth cycles, and they perform significantly worse during national recessions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001884

We construct a new yield curve using a non-parametric kernel-smoothing method with a novel adaptive bandwidth specifically designed to fit the Treasury yields. Our curve is globally smooth while still capturing important local variation. Economically, we show that applying our data leads to different conclusions from using the leading alternative data of Gürkaynak et al. (2007) (GSW) when we repeat two popular studies of Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005) and Giglio and Kelly (2018).

Journal of Financial Economics,2021,GSIB surcharges and bank lending: Evidence from US corporate loan data,"Giovanni Favara, Ivan Ivanov and Marcelo Rezende","Capital surcharges on global systemically important banks (GSIBs) decrease lending to firms but do not have any real effects. Banks subject to higher surcharges reduce loan commitments relative to other banks and also lower their estimates of firm risk. Firms’ total borrowing, however, does not fall, as firms switch to other banks. We establish these results using supervisory data on corporate loans and variation in surcharges in the United States. These results contribute to the debate on the costs and benefits of surcharges and regulatory tailoring and their effects on the reallocation of credit supply across financial institutions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002968
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,"Investment, capital stock, and replacement cost of assets when economic depreciation is non-geometric",Dmitry Livdan and Alexander Nezlobin,"This paper extends the Q-theory of investment to capital goods with arbitrary efficiency profiles. When efficiency is non-geometric, the firm’s capital stock and the replacement cost of its assets are fundamentally different aggregates of the firm’s investment history. If capital goods have constant efficiency over a finite useful life, simple proxies are readily available for both the replacement cost of assets in place and capital stock. Under this assumption, we decompose the total investment rate along two dimensions: into its net and replacement components, and into its cash and non-cash components.

Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Corporate green bonds,Caroline Flammer,"I examine corporate green bonds, whose proceeds finance climate-friendly projects. These bonds have become more prevalent over time, especially in industries where the environment is financially material to firm operations. I show that investors respond positively to the issuance announcement, a response that is stronger for first-time issuers and bonds certified by third parties. The issuers improve their environmental performance post-issuance (i.e., higher environmental ratings and lower CO2 emissions) and experience an increase in ownership by long-term and green investors. Overall, the findings are consistent with a signaling argument—by issuing green bonds, companies credibly signal their commitment toward the environment.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21000337

We find that stocks of firms with higher total carbon dioxide emissions (and changes in emissions) earn higher returns, controlling for size, book-to-market, and other return predictors. We cannot explain this carbon premium through differences in unexpected profitability or other known risk factors. We also find that institutional investors implement exclusionary screening based on direct emission intensity (the ratio of total emissions to sales) in a few salient industries.

The solution to the investor's portfolio problem is characterized by an ESG-efficient frontier, showing the highest attainable Sharpe ratio for each ESG level. The corresponding portfolios satisfy four-fund separation. Equilibrium asset prices are determined by an ESG-adjusted capital asset pricing model, showing when ESG raises or lowers the required return. Combining several large data sets, we compute the empirical ESG-efficient frontier and show the costs and benefits of responsible investing.

We employ several unique international databases to test whether socially responsible corporate customers can infuse similar socially responsible business behavior in suppliers. Our findings suggest a unilateral effect on corporate social responsibility (CSR) only from customers to suppliers, an evidence further supported by exogenous variation in customers’ close-call CSR proposals and by product scandals. Customers exert influence on suppliers’ CSR through positive assortative matching and their decision-making process. Enhanced collaborative CSR efforts help improve operational efficiency and firm valuation of both customers and suppliers but increase only the customers’ future sales growth.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300325

Derivative prices respond both to short-term weather forecasts for the next two weeks and longer-term warming trends. We show that the long-term trends in derivative prices are comparable to station-level data and climate model output. The one exception is February in the northeastern US, where financial markets price in a polar vortex-induced cooling effect, a recent scientific finding that was not present in the older CMIP5 climate output.

Based on a proprietary data set obtained from a large Chinese mutual fund family consisting of complete trading information for more than 773,198 accounts in 247 cities, we find that air pollution significantly increases investors’ disposition effects.

Using novel data on engagements of the Big Three with individual firms, we find evidence that the Big Three focus their engagement effort on large firms with high CO2 emissions in which these investors hold a significant stake.

Counter to the intuition from multitasking models (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991), few impact funds tie compensation directly to impact, and most retain traditional financial incentives. However, funds contract directly on impact in other ways and adjust aspects of the contracts such as governance.

Benchmarking generates additional, inelastic demand for assets inside the benchmark. This leads to a “benchmark inclusion subsidy:” a firm inside the benchmark values an investment project more than the one outside. The same wedge arises for valuing M&A, spinoffs, and IPOs. This overturns the proposition that an investment’s value is independent of the entity considering it.

Journal of Financial Economics,2021,The role of financial conditions in portfolio choices: The case of insurers,Shan Ge and Michael Weisbach,"Many institutional investors depend on the returns they generate to fund their operations and liabilities. How do these investors’ financial conditions affect the management of their portfolios? We address this issue using the insurance industry because insurers are large investors for which detailed portfolio data are available, and can face financial shocks from exogenous weather events which help us establish causality. Among corporate bonds, for which we can control for regulatory treatment, results suggest that when Property & Casualty (P&C) insurers become more constrained due to operating losses, they shift towards safer bonds. The effect of losses on allocations is likely to be causal because it holds when instrumenting for losses with weather shocks. The change in allocations following losses is larger for smaller or worse-rated insurers and during the financial crisis, suggesting that the shift toward safer securities is driven by concerns about financial flexibility. The results highlight the importance of financial conditions in institutional investors’ portfolio decisions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002014

Journal of Financial Economics,2021,The effect of stock liquidity on cash holdings: The repurchase motive,Kjell Nyborg and Zexi Wang,"Enhanced stock liquidity increases a firm’s propensity to hold cash. This is surprising given the view that improved stock liquidity reduces financial constraints. We propose that firms have a repurchase motive for holding cash. Higher stock liquidity strengthens this incentive. Consistent with this, firms with more liquid stock increase cash holdings relatively more when restrictions to repurchases are eased. The effect of stock liquidity on cash holdings is not influenced by access to credit markets. Our findings suggest that the repurchase motive dominates the real investments motive with respect to the effect of stock liquidity on cash holdings.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002099

Using data from a German online brokerage and a survey, we show that retail investors sharply reduce risk taking in response to nearby firm bankruptcies. Adjustments in risk taking occur through immediate and transitory increases in trading, and work through more pessimistic expectations about aggregate stock returns and increased risk aversion. Changes in background risks or wealth effects cannot explain our findings. Extrapolation from local experiences to aggregate expectations is inconsistent with optimal use of full or limited information.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21003032

The manager’s short-term task determines current performance, which deteriorates with investment in the firm’s future profitability, his long-term task. The optimal contract dynamically balances incentives for short- and long-term performance. Investment is distorted upwards (downwards) relative to first-best in firms with high (low) returns to investment. These distortions decrease as good performance relaxes endogenous financial constraints, implying negative (positive) investment-cash flow sensitivities.

If uncertainty shocks are viewed as bad by investors, they should carry negative risk premiums. Empirically, however, uncertainty risk premiums are positive in most markets. Instead, it is the realization of large shocks to fundamentals that has historically carried a negative premium. In other words, we find that the return premium for gamma is negative, while that for vega is positive. These results imply that it is jumps, for which exposure is measured by gamma, not forward-looking uncertainty shocks, measured by vega, that drive investors’ marginal utility. In further support of the jump interpretation, the return patterns are more extreme for deeper out-of-the-money options.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002476

During the two weeks leading up to Federal Reserve System interventions, volume shifted to liquid securities, transaction costs soared, trade-size pricing inverted, and dealers, particularly non-primary dealers, shifted from buying to selling, causing dealers’ inventories to plummet. Liquidity provisions in electronic customer-to-customer trading increased, though at prohibitively high costs. By improving dealer funding conditions and providing a liquidity backstop, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) stabilized trading conditions. Most of the impact of SMCCF on bond liquidity seems to have materialized following its announcement.

Frequency-specific systematic risk is captured by a notion of spectral beta. We show that traditional factor models restrict the spectral betas to be constant across frequencies.

This experiment makes secured lending for the affected banks more attractive vis-à-vis unsecured lending, because secured loans require less regulatory capital. Using loan-level data covering the universe of bank loans in Portugal, we identify how banks require collateral on new loans when facing higher capital requirements: relative to the control group, treated banks require loans to be collateralized more often after the shock. We find the affected banks partially shield their relationship borrowers. The increased collateralization also has economically relevant real effects. Treated banks reallocate funds towards sectors with greater asset tangibility. Firms and sectors borrowing to a greater degree from treated banks exhibit lower growth and tilt their investments towards tangible assets.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001999

This increase in risk-taking is concentrated among firms where the director experiences a shorter, less-costly bankruptcy and where the affected director likely exerts greater influence and serves in an advisory role.

Journal of Financial Economics,2021,"Persistent negative cash flows, staged financing, and the stockpiling of cash balances",David J. Denis and Stephen B. McKeon,"Firms with negative net cash flows (NCFs) play an empirically important role in recent decades’ increase in the average cash-balance ratio of publicly held non-financial firms. Since 1971, negative NCFs have become much more pervasive, persistent, and greater in magnitude, and these patterns hold within the growing set of firms that have high intangible capital. In recent years, firms with negative NCFs tend to build cash balances through frequent equity offerings. The high cash balances tend to be transitory as subsequent negative NCFs lead firms to rapid cash-balance drawdowns, often followed by new stock sales and cash stockpiling of the proceeds. We conclude that funding needs and staged equity financing by negative NCF firms are central features of the secular rise in the average cash-balance ratio.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001689

Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Accounting for financial stability: Bank disclosure and loss recognition in the financial crisis,"Jannis Bischof, Christian Laux and Christian Leuz","This paper examines banks’ disclosures and loss recognition in the 2007–2009 financial crisis and identifies several core issues for the link between accounting and financial stability. We show that, going into the financial crisis, banks’ disclosures about relevant risk exposures were relatively sparse. Such disclosures came later after major concerns about banks’ exposures had arisen in markets. The recognition of loan losses also was slow and delayed relative to prevailing market expectations. Among the possible explanations for this evidence, our analysis indicates that banks’ reporting incentives played a key role, which has important implications for bank supervision and the new expected loss model for loan accounting. We also provide evidence that shielding regulatory capital from accounting losses through prudential filters can dampen banks’ incentives for corrective actions. Overall, our analysis reveals several significant challenges if accounting and financial reporting are to contribute to financial stability.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001987

We exploit firm-level variation in adoption of the Broker Protocol, which enabled clients to follow their advisers to member firms without fear of litigation. We show that advisers’ ability to maintain client relationships is a significant predictor of their employment decisions; that about 40% of client assets follow advisers when they move; and that once clients are “unlocked,” firms become less willing to fire advisers for misconduct. Firms that unlock their clients subsequently experience higher levels of misconduct and increase their fees, calling into question whether clients are better off.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001562
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Did technology contribute to the housing boom? Evidence from MERS,Stefan Lewellen and Emily Williams,"We examine the effects of the Mortgage Electronic Registration System, or MERS, on mortgage origination volumes and foreclosure rates prior to the Great Recession. MERS was introduced in the late 1990s and significantly reduced the cost and time associated with secondary mortgage sales. Using novel data from the Massachusetts Registry of Deeds, we show that the introduction of MERS led to an expansion in mortgage credit supply that was primarily fueled by nonbank lenders originating mortgages to low-income borrowers. We also find that foreclosure rates were higher on these mortgages. Our paper provides a new explanation for the credit supply increases observed prior to the 2008 financial crisis and for the disproportionate supply increase observed in low-income areas.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2100129X

A long low IV-short high IV strategy produces large average returns after transaction costs. Total volatility matters rather than any component or transformation of volatility. The returns are distinct from those in the literature on foreign exchange returns or equity option returns and cannot be explained convincingly by standard risk factors. We argue cross-sectional differences in hedging demand combined with limits to arbitrage contribute to mispricing in FX options.,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001604

We apply our method in a panel regression setting and shed some light on the puzzling empirical result that the market factor drives the bulk of the variance of stock returns, but is often knocked out in cross-sectional tests. In our setup, the market factor is not eliminated. Further, we bypass arbitrary portfolio sorts and instead execute our tests on individual stocks with no loss in power.

We establish this result using the staggered introduction of anti-recharacterization laws in US states.

After the passage of the laws, firms that face more uncertainty hoard less cash and increase payouts, leverage, and investment in intangible assets. Our findings suggest that better access to debt markets shields firms from fluctuations in uncertainty and decreases firms’ precautionary behavior, contributing to the deployment of cash and other internal resources to investment in intangible capital.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21001379

We then isolate individuals who have had discrete increases in credit limits after the exogenous removal of bankruptcy flags to measure the effects of personal credit on entrepreneurship. Following bankruptcy flag removal, individuals are more likely to start a new employer business and borrow extensively. Those who own businesses with employees borrow $40,000 more after bankruptcy flag removal, a 33% gain relative to the sample average.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21000945

We find that firm fundamentals, the existence of a “glass cliff,” gender discrimination bias, and hedge fund activists’ inherent characteristics do not explain the observed gender effect. We also find that the transformational leadership style of female CEOs is a plausible explanation for this gender effect: instead of being self-defensive, female CEOs are more likely to communicate and cooperate with hedge fund activists to achieve intervention goals. Finally, we find that female-led targets experience greater increases in market and operational performance subsequent to hedge fund targeting.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21000817

When we restrict our sample to larger firms, as in the prior literature, we confirm earlier findings of an increasing and concave relation between q and managerial ownership. We show that cumulative past performance and liquidity can explain these seemingly contradictory results. Better performing firms have more liquid equity, which enables firms and insiders to more easily sell shares after the IPO, and they also have a higher Tobin's q.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21000416

We formalize this argument with a conditional factor pricing model. Using instrumented principal components analysis, we estimate latent factors with time-varying factor loadings that depend on observable firm characteristics. We show that factor loadings vary significantly over time, even at short horizons over which the momentum phenomenon operates (one year), and this variation captures reliable conditional risk premia missed by other factor models commonly used in the literature. Our estimates of conditional risk exposure can explain a sizable fraction of momentum and long-term reversal returns and can be used to generate even stronger return predictions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21000878

In contrast, abnormal returns of the volatility-managed market portfolio are robust to transaction costs and concentrated in the most easily arbitraged stocks, those with low arbitrage risk and impediments to short selling.

In crisis times, with higher central bank liquidity, less capitalized banks react by increasing securities over credit supply, inducing worse firm-level real effects.

Since these substitute dividends may be taxed differently than dividend payments themselves, some investors have incentives to either remove their shares from lendable supply–if they pay high taxes on substitute dividends–or lend out their shares to arbitrageurs–if they pay high taxes on dividends. Consistent with these incentives, we find a significant tightening of the equity lending market on dividend record days driven by both a contraction of supply and an expansion of demand–although the demand effect appears to dominate. We then exploit the plausibly exogenous nature of these shifts to causally link tightness in the lending market to wider effective spreads in the stock market.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20303500

The optimal contract can yield either overly risky or overly prudent project selection. It can be implemented with a constant pricing schedule (i.e., a static, decentralized, linear mechanism), giving the agent control over the resource quantities, project risk, and agent’s equity share.

The results provide a number of novel empirical predictions regarding asset prices and disclosure patterns over time.

For such redistribution to take place, the wealth of arriving and existing cohorts must react differently to discount rates, and in addition only the existing agents are marginal in financial markets.

We propose a way to estimate it by combining two key insights: Empirical Bayes methods capture the implicit process by which researchers form priors about the likelihood that a new variable is a tradable anomaly based on their past experience, and under certain conditions, a one-to-one mapping exists between these prior beliefs and the best-fit tuning parameter in a penalized regression.

The 2014 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reform of the money market fund (MMF) industry reduced the money-likeness of prime MMFs by increasing their information sensitivity, while leaving government MMFs unaffected. Investors fled from prime to government MMFs, with total outflows exceeding one trillion dollars.

With rational, fully informed agents and with no hysteresis, a successful cyberattack should have no impact on a financially unconstrained target's reputation and post-attack policies. In contrast, when a successful attack involves the loss of personal financial information, there is a significant shareholder wealth loss, which is much larger than the attack's out-of-pocket costs. This excess loss is higher when the attack decreases sales growth more and lower when the board pays more attention to risk management before the attack. Further, an attack decreases a firm's risk appetite, as it beefs up its risk management and information technology and decreases the risk-taking incentives of management. Finally, successful cyberattacks adversely affect the stock price of firms in the target's industry. These results imply that successful attacks with personal financial information loss provide adverse information about cyber risk to target firms, their stakeholders, and their competitors.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20300143

In the cross-section of U.S. stocks, risk premia for exposure to state variables vary over time accordingly. When a state variable predicts consumption strongly relative to its own history, its annualized risk premium increases by 6% (0.4 in Sharpe ratio).

Impact funds earn 4.7 percentage points (ppts) lower internal rates of return (IRRs) ex-post than traditional VC funds. In random utility/willingness-to-pay (WTP) models investors accept 2.5–3.7 ppts lower IRRs ex ante for impact funds. The positive WTP result is robust to fund access rationing and investor heterogeneity in fund expected returns. Development organizations, foundations, financial institutions, public pensions, Europeans, and United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment signatories have high WTP. Investors with mission objectives and/or facing political pressure exhibit high WTP; those subject to legal restrictions (e.g., Employee Retirement Income Security Act) exhibit low WTP.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2030194X
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Creditor control rights and resource allocation within firms,"Nuri Ersahin, Rustom M. Irani and Hanh Le","We examine the within-firm resource allocation and restructuring outcomes at firms violating debt covenants. Using establishment-level data from the US Census Bureau, we find that covenant violations are followed by reductions in employment, investment, and more frequent establishment closures among violating firms’ noncore business lines and less productive establishments. These changes are concentrated among establishments at which manager-shareholder agency costs are pronounced and when key lenders have industry experience. Our findings suggest that enhanced creditor control reduces managerial agency costs and encourages a more efficient allocation of resources within the boundaries of firms in technical default.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20301926
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Flying under the radar: The effects of short-sale disclosure rules on investor behavior and stock prices,"Stephan Jank, Christoph Roling and Esad Smajlbegovic","We study how disclosure requirements for large short positions affect investor behavior and security prices. Short positions accumulate just below the applicable disclosure threshold as certain investors never disclose any of their positions. Further tests suggest that this secrecy is part of investors’ general policy of avoiding disclosure to protect their unique, profitable investment strategies against reverse engineering by competitors. No evidence supports the notion that short sellers avoid disclosure because of potential adverse effects on securities' lending fees, risk of recall, or short squeezes. Finally, the evasive behavior by short sellers in response to transparency regulations hampers price discovery.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20302075
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Global market inefficiencies,Söhnke Bartram and Mark Grinblatt,"Using point-in-time accounting data, we estimate monthly fair values of 25,000+ stocks from 36 countries. A trading strategy based on deviations from fair value earns significant risk-adjusted returns (“alpha”) in most regions, especially Asia-Pacific, that are unrelated to known anomalies. The strategy's 40–70 basis point per month alpha difference between emerging and developed markets contrast with prior research findings. A country's pre-transaction cost alpha is positively related to its trading costs, but exceeds country-specific institutional trading costs. Thus, global equity markets are inefficient, particularly in countries with quantifiable market frictions, like trading costs, that deter arbitrageurs.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20302087
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Identifying and boosting “Gazelles”: Evidence from business accelerators,Juanita González-Uribe and Santiago Reyes,"Why is high-growth entrepreneurship scarce in developing countries? Does this scarcity reflect firm capabilities constraints? We explore these questions using as a laboratory an accelerator in Colombia that selects participants using scores from randomly assigned judges and offers them training, advice, and visibility but no cash. Exploiting exogenous differences in judges’ scoring generosity, we show that alleviating constraints to firm capabilities unlocks innovative entrepreneurs’ potential but does not transform subpar ideas into high-growth firms. The results demonstrate that some high-potential entrepreneurs in developing economies face firm capabilities constraints and accelerators can help identify these entrepreneurs and boost their growth.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20302208
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,Procyclicality of the comovement between dividend growth and consumption growth,Nancy R. Xu,"Duffee (2005) shows that the amount of consumption risk (i.e., the conditional covariance between market returns and consumption growth) is procyclical. In light of this “Duffee Puzzle,” I empirically demonstrate that the conditional covariance between dividend growth (i.e., the immediate cash flow part of market returns) and consumption growth is (1) procyclical and (2) a consistent source of procyclicality in the puzzle. Moreover, I solve an external habit formation model that incorporates realistic joint dynamics of dividend growth and consumption growth. The procyclical dividend-consumption comovement entails two new procyclical terms in the amount of consumption risk via cash flow and valuation channels, respectively. These two procyclical terms play an important role in generating a realistic magnitude of consumption risk. In contrast to extant habit formation models, the conditional equity premium no longer increases monotonically when a negative consumption shock arrives because it might lower the amount of risk while increasing the price of risk.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20302233
Journal of Financial Economics,2021,The difference a day makes: Timely disclosure and trading efficiency in the muni market,"John Chalmers, Liu, Yu (Steve) and Z. Jay Wang","The Real-Time Transaction Reporting System (RTRS) reduced the delay in reporting municipal bond trades from one-day to 15 min. We find a significant reduction in secondary market trading costs after the introduction of the RTRS. Our estimates imply that retail investors benefited primarily from reduced dealer intermediation costs, while large trades benefited from reductions in bargaining costs. Bonds experienced increases in trading volume across the liquidity spectrum. We find higher dealer capital commitment, longer intermediation chains, and fewer pre-arranged trades, all suggesting increased market-making incentives for dealers. These results are largely consistent with predictions from search-based models.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X20302257
