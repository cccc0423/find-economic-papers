Journal of Public Economics,2022,State responses to federal matching grants: The case of medicaid,Pauline Leung,"While Medicaid is currently financed by open-ended matching, in which the federal government’s contribution is uncapped, there has been interest in transforming the financing structure to block grants, which limits federal cost-sharing to a fixed amount. To understand the implications of this reform, I measure the effect of match rates on Medicaid spending by using the variation induced by a kink in the match rate formula. I find that a percentage point increase in the federal match raises per-beneficiary spending by 3 to 6 percent and that these results are driven by high-spending states. Using this estimate, I discuss the welfare impact of a block grant reform.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001487
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Subsidizing low- and middle-income adoption of electric vehicles: Quasi-experimental evidence from California,Erich Muehlegger and David Rapson,"Little is known about electric vehicle (EV) demand by low- and middle-income households. In this paper, we exploit a policy that provides exogenous variation in large EV subsidies targeted at the mass market in California. Using transaction-level data, we estimate three important policy parameters: the rate of subsidy pass-through, the impact of the subsidy on EV adoption, and the elasticity of demand for EVs among low- and middle-income households. Demand for EVs in our sample is price-elastic (−2.1) and buyers capture roughly 73 to 85 percent of the subsidy.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001542
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Reference points and redistributive preferences: Experimental evidence,"Jimmy Charité, Raymond Fisman, Ilyana Kuziemko and Kewei Zhang","We explore whether individuals, when acting as social planners, respect others’ reference points. We allow subjects to redistribute unequal, unearned initial endowments between two anonymous recipients. Subjects redistribute twenty percent less when recipients know their initial endowments (and thus may have formed corresponding reference points) than when the recipients do not know their initial endowments, in which case we observe near-complete redistribution. The result holds for both within- and between-subject comparisons and is robust to a number of variants in design. The extensive margin response (redistributing zero versus any amount) drives the difference, further suggesting that respect for reference points drives the observed limited redistribution.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001633
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Do mandated health insurance benefits for diabetes save lives?,Jinyeong Son,"In response to the growing concern over diabetes, state-mandated health insurance benefits for diabetes have become popular since the late 1990s. However, little is known about whether these mandates improve the health of people with diabetes. In this paper, I use data from the restricted-use Multiple Cause of Death Mortality database and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to investigate the effects of these mandates on diabetes-related mortality rates, along with the underlying mechanisms behind the estimated effects. Using a difference-in-differences framework that leverages variation in the enactment of mandates both across states and over time, I find that approximately 3.1 fewer diabetes-related deaths per 100,000 occur annually in mandate states than in non-mandate states. The mechanism analysis suggests higher utilization of the mandated medical benefits caused these mortality improvements. These findings can inform the ongoing policy debate on strengthening or weakening coverage mandates, including Essential Health Benefits under the Affordable Care Act.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001645
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Paternalism and pseudo-rationality: An illustration based on retirement savings,Itzik Fadlon and David Laibson,"Resource allocations are jointly determined by the actions of social planners and households. We study economies in which households have private information about their tastes and have a distribution of behavioral propensities: optimal, myopic, or passive. In such economies, we show that utilitarian planners enact policies such as Social Security and default savings that cause equilibrium consumption smoothing (on average in the cross-section of households). Our framework resolves tensions in the household savings literature by simultaneously explaining evidence of consumption smoothing and optimal savings on average across households while also predicting behavioral anomalies at the household level. In general, common tests of consumption smoothing are not sufficient to show that households are optimizers, but observational data or natural experiments can be used to identify the fractions of optimizing, myopic, and passive households.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001657
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Identity and underrepresentation: Interactions between race and gender,Jean-Paul Carvalho and Bary  Pradelski,"Economic outcomes vary significantly across socio-demographic groups. In a model of multidimensional identity, we show how differences in economic participation can give rise to identity-specific norms which ‘normalize’ and lock in the historical underrepresentation of various groups. Whereas standard approaches treat identity dimensions as independent, our analysis reveals deep connections between inequality and underrepresentation based on race, gender, and other characteristics. ‘Sterilized interventions’ along a single identity dimension are generally impossible. Interventions that aim to reduce underrepresentation along one identity dimension can increase underrepresentation along another. We show how underrepresentation can be eliminated along every dimension, through a system of (a) self-financing subsidies or (b) role models, where interventions are ‘intersectional’, i.e., connected across identity dimensions. When the strength of group identification is made endogenous, underrepresentation disappears in the long run on its own. Depending on the environment, affirmative action can either speed up or slow down this process.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001669

The students − 7–9 years old - are pulled out from their regular mathematics classes into small, homogenous groups of 4–6 students for mathematics instruction for 3 to 4 h per week, for two periods of 4–6 weeks per school year. Unlike many other recent tutoring experiments, all students are pulled out, not only struggling students. In our intention-to-treat analysis, we find that students in treatment schoolsincreased their performance by0.06of a standard deviation in national tests, with no differential effect by baseline test score level, parental education, or gender.

Journal of Public Economics,2022,Assessing knowledge or classroom behavior? Evidence of teachers’ grading bias,Bruno Ferman and Luiz Felipe Fontes,"This paper tests whether teachers unequally evaluate students based on their classroom behavior, rather than their scholastic competence. Evidence is drawn from a unique dataset on students from Brazil, which allows us to contrast teacher- and blindly-assigned scores on achievement tests that are high-stakes and cover the same material. We find that teachers inflate test scores of better-behaved students, and deduct points from worse-behaved ones. We also find that teachers’ decision to promote students is influenced by how they behave in class. Our results (i) document a potentially inefficient way of assessing students’ knowledge, (ii) explain a large part of grading discrimination against boys, and (iii) reveal a causal effect of noncognitive skills on educational outcomes that is unrelated to student proficiency.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272200175X

Our bunching and difference-in-differences results show that a substantial share of those who report earning the minimum wage earn at least the same amount off the books.

Journal of Public Economics,2022,Syringe exchange programs and harm reduction: New evidence in the wake of the opioid epidemic,Analisa Packham,"In light of the recent opioid crisis, many public health entities have called for an expansion in syringe exchange programs (SEPs), which provide access to sterile syringes and facilitate safe needle disposal for injection drug users. This paper uses a newly constructed administrative dataset to estimate the effects of recent SEP openings on HIV diagnoses and drug-related deaths. I find that SEP openings decrease HIV rates by up to 18.2 percent. However, I present new evidence that SEPs increase rates of opioid-related mortality. Effects are largest in rural counties and in counties that adopted SEPs after the influx of fentanyl to the US, suggesting that needle exchanges may be less effective during periods when illicit opioids are widely available, especially in areas with high barriers to substance abuse treatment.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001359

We find a large, sudden increase in withdrawals after the penalty’s expiration of 3–3.5 times the baseline level, with no evidence of anticipatory behavior. After one month, average withdrawals decline to and persist at approximately double the baseline. We find that the short-run increase is more pronounced when liquidity constraints are more likely to have been binding. Finally, we explore the implications of our results for policies that adjust the age at which early penalties expire or policies that temporarily remove such penalties.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001360

For voters, group identification can give rise to a preference for own-group payoffs, for electing an own-group candidate, and could be used to assess candidate-sincerity. For candidates, identity might affect the optimal campaign platform. There is evidence to support all four. Our key contribution comes from bringing the candidate supply of redistribution policies into an equilibrium analysis with voter demand for redistribution. It yields an important new insight: the extent of minority group political representation among the electoral candidates critically affects redistribution outcomes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001499

Consistent with predictions of a model of private–public school competition, we find evidence of stratification in terms of academic preparation and socioeconomic status. High-performing students sort into private schools, as do students from affluent families and from relatively privileged castes (especially males). In principle such stratification might undermine public schools, but our analysis of students across the socioeconomic spectrum shows no evidence of harm to those who remain in public schools.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001517

We propose a model in which educators with high fixed-costs use charter schools to explore teaching careers before obtaining licenses required for higher paying public sector jobs. A key implication of the theoretical model is that charter schools create positive externalities for traditional public schools by increasing the average quality of available teacher labor. Empirical results show patterns consistent with the model. In particular, we show that charters are more likely to lose their highest and lowest value-added teachers. Low performers tend to exit public education, while high performers tend to switch to traditional public schools.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001529

This paper examines the effects of the PPCDAm – a centralized set of environmental policies that effectively raised the expected cost of illegal deforestation – on the behavior of a powerful special-interest group operating in the Brazilian Amazon: farmers. Using different identification strategies, we document that municipalities governed by farmer politicians experienced larger declines in deforestation, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and violence than municipalities governed by other politicians after this set of policies was implemented.

Using an exposure design that combines time-series variation in the federal marginal tax rate for top 1% earners with cross-sectional variation in the top 1% income share across local labor markets, I find very little evidence of local trickle-down effects. The point estimates imply zero local trickle-down effects. At conventional levels of confidence, the estimates are statistically inconsistent with a one percentage point increase in the top tax rate reducing worker wages by more than −0.08%. These results undermine claims that trickle-down effects should be an important consideration in setting top tax rates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000913
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Eliciting preferences for income redistribution: A new survey item,Jochem de Bresser and Marike Knoef,"This paper introduces a new survey item through which to measure people’s preferences toward income redistribution. Respondents construct their preferred distribution of after-tax income by changing the tax rates of the bottom four income quintiles. Taxes for the top quintile update automatically in order to keep government revenues fixed and take into account behavioral effects on pre-tax income. Data from a large, representative sample of the Dutch population indicates that around 50–60% of the respondents construct distributions that are more equal overall than the status quo, as measured by the Gini coefficient. Indeed, only 5% of respondents opt for greater inequality, but not beyond a flat-tax. Income ratios for the bottom and top half of the distribution indicate greater support for additional redistribution among those on higher rather than lower incomes. The validity of the responses to the new item is supported by their predictive power for voting behavior in the parliamentary elections almost three years later, even when controlling for a Likert scale. Two information provision experiments illustrate the richness of the new data.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001268
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Infrastructure maintenance and rural economic activity: Evidence from India,Ritam Chaurey and Duong Trung Le,"We evaluate the impact of a rural infrastructure development and maintenance scheme, directed towards India’s most “backward” districts. Importantly, these infrastructure grants were spent on maintenance, improvements, and complementary investments to existing infrastructure. Using a Regression Discontinuity Design and multiple data sets covering the entire firm size distribution, as well as household employment surveys, we show evidence on the effectiveness of the program on local economic activity. In treated districts, the policy appears to have increased overall village-level employment, and the number of microenterprises, but there were no changes for formal firms. These increases were likely driven by a decline in the share of agricultural wage workers. At the individual-level, wages and the number of days worked also increased. There is suggestive evidence that both rural electrification and connectivity were important mechanisms driving our results. We find stronger impacts in electricity and road-intensive industries, and in villages that had paved roads and electricity prior to the program. Overall, our paper suggests that improving rural infrastructure conditions can boost economic activity, especially by stimulating microenterprises.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272200127X

To learn more about justices’ preferences and the nature of decision-making in the Court, we differentiate between votes that were pivotal and those that were not. We find that in situations in which a justice is pivotal, her ideology is even more predictive of her vote than usual, especially when her choice matters for unambiguously establishing legal precedent. To interpret this previously unknown pattern in the data, we develop a model of voting in which justices have both expressive and instrumental preferences. That is, the justices strategically trade off which litigant should prevail based on the merits of a case with their desire to shape precedent.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001281

Reduced-form evidence reveals substantial adjustment frictions attenuating bunching and de-bunching responses. Combining the empirical bunching moments with a structural model of frictional earnings supply, adjustment costs are estimated between EUR 93 and EUR 238 for wage earners. Moreover, we uncover important asymmetries in adjustment frictions, where bunching at a kink is costlier than de-bunching away from the kink.

Journal of Public Economics,2022,Political manipulation of urban land markets: Evidence from China,"J. Vernon Henderson, Dongling Su, Qinghua Zhang and Siqi Zheng","Over the last forty years, China has experienced extraordinary growth under output market reforms, but the growth rates are now tapering off. Reforms in factor markets and city governance have been much slower and are viewed as having the potential to yield considerable efficiency gains. In this paper, we explore this possibility, tackling the key issues of local political manipulation of land markets and objectives of local leaders, constraints on the local budgetary process to finance infrastructure and capital market favoritism of certain cities. We use a structural general equilibrium model with trade and migration frictions, based on prefecture level data. We model the political process of land misallocation within cities which drives up housing prices and estimate city-by-city local leaders’ preferences over economic performance versus residents’ welfare. Counterfactual analysis shows that equalizing capital prices across cities, changing the political scorecard for city leaders to reward just maximization of local consumer welfare, and relaxing local budget constraints together increase welfare of consumers and returns to capital by 13.7% and 2.25% respectively. Housing prices would decline in almost all cities; and the reforms would reduce the current excessive, often showcase investment in local public infrastructure by 49% nationally. These reforms would significantly reduce the population of favored cities with low capital costs like Tianjin and Beijing and raise the population of cities with high costs of capital and low local-leader weights on consumer welfare like Shenzhen and Dongguan.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001323

The UK introduced a worldwide debt cap in 2010, generating a quasi-natural experiment that limited interest deductibility for a group of multinational firms. We find that multinationals affected by the reform reduced the amount of debt held in the UK and increased debt held abroad.

We find that the social preferences of group members are a key determinant of the group’s coordination choice. Controlling for social preferences of the group, groups with more women are more likely to make choices that are kinder to external parties. Both men and women believe that women will make kinder choices more frequently. Groups comprised of all men are expected to make 18 percentage points fewer kind choices than groups of all women.

Journal of Public Economics,2022,Simulated power analyses for observational studies: An application to the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion,"Bernard Black, Alex Hollingsworth, Letícia Nunes and Kosali Simon","Power is an important factor in assessing the likely validity of a statistical estimate. An analysis with low power is unlikely to produce convincing evidence of a treatment effect even when one exists. Of greater concern, a statistically significant estimate from a low-powered analysis is likely to misstate the true effect size, including finding estimates of the wrong sign or that are several times too large. Yet statistical power is rarely reported in published economics work. This is in part because many modern research designs are complex enough that power cannot be easily ascertained using simple formulae. Power can also be difficult to estimate in observational settings. Using an applied example–the link between gaining health insurance and mortality–we conduct a simulated power analysis to outline the importance of power and ways to estimate power in complex research settings. We find that standard difference-in-differences and triple differences analyses of Medicaid expansions using county or state mortality data would need to induce reductions in population mortality of at least 2% to be well powered. While there is no single, correct method for conducting a simulated power analysis, our manuscript outlines how applied researchers can conduct simulations appropriate to their settings.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001153
Journal of Public Economics,2022,The psychology of taxing capital income: Evidence from a survey experiment on the realization rule,Zachary Liscow and Edward Fox,"We conduct the first survey experiment to understand public attitudes about the realization rule for capital gains. This rule requires that assets usually must be sold before gains on them are taxed and thus makes taxing capital income much harder. We have three main findings. First, respondents strongly prefer to wait to tax gains on stocks until sale: 75% to 25%. But the flip side is that there is surprisingly strong support for taxing gains on assets at sale or transfer, including at death, in areas where current law never taxes those gains. Second, these stated views change only modestly when randomized participants observe a policy debate composed of videos explaining both the pros and cons of taxing before sale, though the pro and con treatments have large effects individually. And, third, among many possible explanations of these attitudes, we find particular evidence for three: mental accounting; status quo effects; and a desire to tax consumption, not income.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001165
Journal of Public Economics,2022,"Another day, another visit: Impact of Arkansas’ mandatory waiting period for women seeking an abortion by demographic groups",Onur Altindag and Theodore Joyce,"Twenty-six states require that women seeking an abortion wait between 18 and 72 h after receipt of counseling before the abortion can be completed. Thirteen states require that the counseling be given in person necessitating at least two visits to the provider. In April of 2015, Arkansas increased the waiting period for an abortion from 24 to 48 h and more significantly, required that women receive the counseling in person. The two-visit requirement, unnecessary from a medical standpoint, substantially increases the cost in terms of travel, lost work, child care, and exposure to stigma and harassment upon accessing abortion facilities. We use a regression discontinuity design to analyze the immediate effect of Arkansas’s 2015 mandatory waiting period (MWP) law on abortion rates. We use de-identified, individual-level data from the Arkansas Department of Health (DOH) on all abortions performed in Arkansas from 2000 to 2020. Our study is the first to use monthly individual data and stratify analyses by race/ethnicity, age, parity, marital status and schooling. Abortion rates fell 17 percent among all women, but 22 percent among white non-Hispanics and 14 percent among black non-Hispanics immediately after the law went into effect. We show that the law decreased abortion rates the most among unmarried adults with children. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion will become illegal in Arkansas. Given the decline in abortion rates associated the MWP’s two-visit requirement, abortion rates will likely fall further as travel distance to the nearest legal provider increases.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001177
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Statutory incidence and sales tax compliance: Evidence from Wayfair,"William Fox, Enda Hargaden and LeAnn Luna","This paper studies the compliance, pricing, and progressivity effects of changing statutory incidence. The Wayfair Supreme Court decision granted U.S. states new authority to shift the statutory incidence of taxation from consumers to online and out-of-state retailers, forcing supply-side remittance of the sales tax. With state-level data, we find this increased sales tax revenues by 7.9 percent, concentrated in states with stringent compliance standards. With barcode-level scanner data, we find evidence of full pass-through of the tax to consumers. Effects are progressive however, with the reforms increasing tax liabilities principally for higher-income households.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722001189

One purpose of the present paper is to use Monte Carlo simulation techniques to assess the bias and precision of the prevalent estimators in the literature, the IV-regression estimator and the bunching estimator. Thereby, we aim to provide arguments in favor of, or against, using these methods. Another is to suggest indirect inference estimation to improve the quality of the measurement of the ETI. While IV-regression estimators perform well in terms of bias under certain conditions, they are more variable than bunching estimators. We also find that bunching estimators can be biased downward. The estimators based on indirect inference principles are practically unbiased and more precise than the other estimators.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000810

Journal of Public Economics,2022,"Gridlock, leverage, and policy bundling",Barton Lee,"I consider a dynamic model of bargaining where alternatives to the status quo arrive stochastically during the bargaining process, the proposer can bundle multiple alternatives into a single proposal, and a forward-looking voter elects the agenda-setter. I show that the prevailing wisdom that policy bundling reduces gridlock—by facilitating compromise across different policy areas—is incomplete. Policy bundling can also increase gridlock: a player may veto or delay a bipartisan alternative, which is unanimously preferred to the status quo, so that in the future they can bundle this same alternative with a divisive alternative that otherwise would not pass. Gridlock of this form is more likely to occur during periods of economic or political stability and, when it occurs, suggests that traditional measures of legislator ideology will overstate polarization. From the voter’s perspective, gridlock occurs at an inefficiently high frequency. This state of “excess gridlock” is driven by the voter being forward-looking and lacking commitment power.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000895

The analysis focuses on the installation of capital intensive air pollution abatement technology in highly regulated “nonattainment” areas, which violate federal air quality standards. The primary research design uses a regression discontinuity in the vote share for Republican governors and event study analyses of close elections. In nonattainment areas, Republican gubernatorial control differentially decreases new air pollution abatement capital spending by 90% and the probability of installing the most effective nitrogen oxide abatement technology by nine percentage points, relative to attainment areas and the counterfactual of Democratic gubernatorial control. The health benefits from reduced nitrogen oxide emissions in nonattainment areas likely exceed the additional costs of new air pollution abatement technology at electric utilities. However, the estimated benefit-cost ratios are smaller than those from many other air pollution abatement policies and net benefits may be negative for technology that will operate for fewer than five years.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000901

In the context of income taxation, this implies that differences in income trends across the income distribution should remain constant in the absence of tax reforms. Similar to pre-trend validation of differences-in-differences studies, we can validate this assumption by comparing the evolution of income in untreated parts of the income distribution.

Journal of Public Economics,2022,A dynamic model of fiscal decentralization and public debt accumulation,"Si Guo, Yun Pei and Zoe Xie","This paper develops a dynamic infinite-horizon model with two layers of governments to study theoretically and quantitatively how fiscal decentralization affects local and central government debt accumulation and spending. In the model, the central government makes transfers to local governments to offset vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances. But the anticipation of transfers lowers local governments’ expected cost of borrowing and leads to overborrowing ex ante. Absent commitment, the central government over-transfers to reduce local governments’ future need to borrow, and in the equilibrium both local and central debts are inefficiently high. Consistent with empirical evidence, when fiscal decentralization widens vertical fiscal imbalances, local governments become more reliant on transfers, and both local and central debts rise. Applied to Spain, the model explains 39 percent of the rise in total government debt when the vertical fiscal imbalances widened during 1988–1996, and 18 percent of the fall in debt when the imbalances narrowed during 1996–2006.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000949

If the Setter’s first proposal is rejected, the Setter will make a second proposal. Sophisticated Voters will anticipate the second proposal in responding to the first proposal. The Setter takes their sophistication into account in making the first proposal. We compare outcomes when the Setter faces the same Voters in the two periods with outcomes when the Setter faces different Voters in the two periods, and compare both with the corresponding outcomes with naïve Voters. For some distributions of Voter preferences, Voter sophistication eliminates the benefit to the Setter from having two opportunities; for others, the Setter can exploit the sophistication of Voters to do even better than when Voters are naïve. Whether Voters are sophisticated or naïve, the Setter always does at least as well with two opportunities than with one, but does not always do better.

We characterize the social network these searches comprise, including its degree of homophily and reciprocation, and the demographics of targets and searchers. About one-fourth of searches occur within identifiable household and employment networks. Most searchers target people similar to themselves—homophily in network parlance—but young, low-income searchers also target older, successful people and celebrities. A causal research design based on the timing of searches relative to tax filing uncovers no evidence that, upon discovering they were targeted, targets subsequently increase their reported income. The evidence suggests that social comparisons motivate the bulk of searches rather than tax compliance.

We study changes in families’ choices of school sector using longitudinal student-level administrative data from Michigan and nationally representative data from the Census Household Pulse Survey. Public school enrollment declined noticeably in fall 2020, with 3 percent of Michigan students and 10 percent of kindergartners using other options. Most of this came from homeschooling rates jumping substantially among families with children in elementary school. Consistent with heterogeneous parental preferences for instructional mode, homeschooling increased more where schools provided in-person instruction while private schooling increased more where instruction was remote. Kindergarten declines were highest among low income and Black families while declines in other grades were highest among higher income and White families, highlighting important heterogeneity by students’ existing attachment to public schools.

On average, each dollar of grant revenue caused a $0.45 increase in sewerage capital spending. Dividing previously estimated benefit-to-cost ratios of CWA grants by this estimate suggests that each CWA grant dollar that municipalities spent on sewerage capital generated an average return of $1.01. In addition to funding grants, the Act set new capital standards for all wastewater treatment facilities in the United States. We show that CWA grants caused a dollar-for-dollar increase in sewerage capital spending up to the amount needed to cover the costs of capital upgrades newly mandated by the CWA, but after municipalities met these capital requirements, or if the capital mandate was not binding, they reduced their own spending on sewerage capital in response to grant receipt.

Specifically, in relation to tax pass-through, we provide “sufficient statistics” formulas for two welfare measures under a fairly general class of demand, production cost, and market competition. The measures are (i) marginal value of public funds (i.e., the marginal change in consumer and producer surplus relative to an increase in the net cost to the government), and (ii) incidence (i.e., the ratio of a marginal change in consumer surplus to a marginal change in producer surplus). We begin with the case of symmetric firms facing both unit and ad valorem taxes to derive a simple and empirically relevant set of formulas. Then, we provide a substantial generalization of these results to encompass firm heterogeneity by using the idea of tax revenue that is specified as a general function parameterized by a vector of policy instruments including government and non-government interventions and costs other than taxation.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721002255

We conduct a series of surveys eliciting participation in Hong Kong’s antiauthoritarian movement, covering a period that included protests ranging from tens of thousands to over one million participants. For a sample of university students, we construct a comprehensive profile of fundamental economic preferences: risk and time preferences plausibly affecting an individual’s costs of protest participation; social preferences affecting the benefits. We also elicit other fundamental traits: personality, cognitive abilities, and socioeconomic background. We document several facts about protest participants: (i) fundamental economic preferences, particularly risk tolerance and pro-social preferences, are the strongest predictors of protest participation; (ii) the strongest predictors are the same for modest and massive protests, with larger effects for massive protests; (iii) participation in massive protests is not driven by marginal types, but rather by inframarginal types; (iv) both the distribution of fundamental preferences and their relationship with protest participation are very similar between university students and the broader population; and, (v) willingness to respond honestly to sensitive survey questions is high and stable over the entire sample period.

Specifically, we investigate the effect of caste hierarchies on the amount of emergency aid given to households after the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. Local committees allocated aid immediately after the earthquake, and –officially– the amount of aid was a function of the magnitude of the housing damage. To identify discrimination and in-group favoritism in this context, we utilize rich data on house characteristics and housing damage and exploit exogenous variation in earthquake intensity. We first provide evidence for caste-based discrimination by these committees: Upper caste households received more aid than lower caste households. Second, we find in-group favoritism among upper caste households: Upper caste households received more aid if individuals from their own (upper) caste were involved in the allocation of aid. In contrast, lower caste households did not benefit from the presence of their own (lower) caste representatives in aid allocation committees.

Results show that these programs generate consistently large proportional decreases in criminal justice involvement, even as administrators recruit additional youth, hire new local providers, find more job placements, and vary the content of their programs. Using both endogeneous stratification within cities and variation in 62 new and existing point estimates across cities uncovers a key pattern of individual responsiveness: impacts grow linearly with the risk of socially costly behavior each person faces. Identifying more interventions that combine this pattern of robustness to treatment variation with bigger effects for the most disconnected could aid efforts to reduce social inequality efficiently.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000196
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Do temporary workers experience additional employment and earnings risk after workplace injuries?,"Nicholas Broten, Michael Dworsky and David Powell","Do temporary workers face more employment and earnings risk than direct-hire workers? We link administrative workers’ compensation claims to earnings records to measure the risk posed by workplace injuries, comparing employment and earnings outcomes between temporary and direct-hire workers injured doing the same job. We implement two complementary empirical strategies to account for underlying differences in labor market attachment. Despite evidence that injury severity does not vary between the two sets of workers, temporary workers suffer larger reductions in employment and more severe earnings losses, persisting at least three years after injury, relative to similar direct-hire workers. The additional earnings losses suffered by temporary workers are partially offset by workers’ compensation benefits, but the income loss gap is still large even after accounting for these benefits.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000305

We derive formulas for the optimal tax rates on capital, labour, and innovation on a balanced growth path. We compute the balanced growth path and the transition to it with optimal policy for a range of parameter values. We find that capital should be taxed in the short run, but be paid its marginal product in the long run. The returns to innovation and production labour, on the other hand, should always be lower than their marginal products. Whether the resulting taxes on innovative activity should be positive or negative depends on (a) the extent of government spending needs, (b) the importance of innovation externalities and (c) the market power of patent holders.

We estimate the labor market impacts of payroll taxation in Singapore, the country with the most competitive and flexible labor market among the countries investigated in the literature. By exploiting the sharp reduction in payroll tax rate when workers turn 60, we find that the reduced payroll tax rate in Singapore has a large effect on wages without changes in employment. Our meta-analysis shows consistent evidence that varying degrees of labor market competitiveness across places and time could explain the mixed results in the literature. Our findings corroborate the prediction of the canonical model that the welfare costs of social insurance programs financed by payroll taxes can be small in a competitive labor market.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000482

We find that local governments responded by undertaking more urban renewal projects that aimed to redevelop and rehabilitate “blighted” areas. More Black migrants also led to an increase in family displacement. This underscores the contribution of spatial policies such as urban renewal towards understanding the long-term consequences of the Great Migration on central cities, and Black neighborhoods and individuals.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000494

The novelty of our approach is to posit that people are motivated by reciprocity – an urge many argue affects humans. While many have suggested that market interactions make people more selfish, our reciprocity-based theory allows that market interaction on the contrary induces more prosociality. Our experiment provides a test of the empirical relevance of such an effect, in some highly stylized settings. The results are broadly (but not completely) supportive. They may shed light on the development of morality and prosocial behavior over time, with respect to episodes in history where the nature of commerce was transformed.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000500

We revisit this hypothesis by combining information on massive local government hydropower and petroleum revenues in Norway with five decades of registry data on individual mayors’ earnings and wealth. We find that, while the resource expansions massively boost local government revenues and spending, there is no evidence that mayors exploit the windfalls to enrich themselves. We attribute our precisely estimated zero-finding to characteristics of the Norwegian institutional and informational environment. First, we show that the revenue windfalls induce citizens to seek political information and raise their rates of electoral participation. Second, in the early sample period when local newspapers were more important, mayors’ wage responses were negatively related to newspaper coverage. In sum, our results suggest that voter information is a key disciplining accountability mechanism, potentially explaining our zero-rent result.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000524

Journal of Public Economics,2022,The medicaid windfall: Medicaid expansions and the target efficiency of hospital safety-net subsidies,Sayeh Nikpay,"Federal hospital safety-net subsidy programs seek to defray costs of uncompensated hospital care, but eligibility criteria are based on Medicaid volume. Therefore, subsidies have poor “target efficiency”: hospitals that provide large amounts of uncompensated care may not receive subsidies (exclusion error), while hospitals that provide little uncompensated care may receive subsidies (inclusion error). Medicaid expansions may exacerbate poor targeting by increasing Medicaid patient volume while reducing uncompensated care. Using hospital administrative data from 2003 to 2019, I quantify the target efficiency of Medicare and Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments and the 340B drug discount program and quantify how changes in Medicaid eligibility affect safety-net subsidy receipt and target efficiency. I find that the ACA Medicaid expansion increased participation in Medicare DSH and 340B, especially among non-safety-net hospitals (inclusion errors) resulting in a shift of approximately $5B from safety-net to non-safety-net hospitals. I find the opposite for a Medicaid contraction in Tennessee in 2005. My results demonstrate an unintended consequence of Medicaid-based eligibility criteria: changes in Medicaid coverage affect the allocation of public subsidies for safety-net patients.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272100219X

This paper explores the environmental health costs of burning natural gas by-products during crude oil extraction – flaring. We estimate the impact of flared natural gas on respiratory health by using quasi-random variation in upwind flaring generated by the interaction of wind patterns and natural gas processing capacity. Specifically, we construct a novel dataset to estimate the causal effect of increased upwind flaring on the monthly respiratory-related hospital visitation rate by using the number of upwind wells that are connected to a capacity-constrained natural gas processing facility as an instrument for monthly upwind flaring. We find that a 1% increase in the amount of flared natural gas in North Dakota would increase the respiratory-related hospital visitation rate by 0.73%. Furthermore, zip codes that were exposed to more than half of all flared natural gas extracted less than 20% of all resource wealth during the sample time period, and the zip codes exposed to a disproportionate amount of flaring tend to be economically-disadvantaged and communities of color. Our estimates indicate that the health costs constitute a material portion of the external cost of flaring, and therefore ought to be considered in global initiatives to reduce flaring.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000032

Using high–frequency data on media–reported events, I find robust evidence that governments resort to diversionary strategies in times of domestic turmoil and that such diversion takes the form of verbally aggressive foreign interactions. Diversionary interactions are typically targeted at countries closely linked along cultural and geographic dimensions, and at countries with low levels of state capability. Interestingly, I do not find evidence of these strategies being effective in deterring domestic turmoil. Taken together, these findings provide new insights on governments’ systematic use of verbally aggressive foreign interactions as a short-term, low-cost, low-risk, strategic tool, to divert domestic turmoil.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272200010X

Media scholars and U.S. historians claim that TV with its unprecedented advertising appeal drew Americans into a culture of upscaling and purchasing products for social status. I test this prevailing theory using newly digitized nationwide county-level retail sales data from the Census of Business series. I compare growth in retail sales between areas with and without local TV service over the unanticipated Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Freeze, which halted the licensing of new TV stations from 1948–52. I find three results that corroborate TV’s long-attributed role in American consumerism. First, during the Freeze, total retail sales in counties with TV access increased by 3–4% more on average than in counties without access. Second, the effect of TV was concentrated in the automobile sector, which alone accounted for a third of the total difference. Third, TV advertising led to higher growth in sales, but only for durable goods, which neatly aligns with both qualitative reports and theories of conspicuous consumption. Historians also propose that the suburban family life popularized in TV sitcoms became the mainstream representation of the American Dream in the 1950s. Consistent with these accounts, I find that the start of TV access coincides with greater activity in local highway construction and birthrates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000111

Journal of Public Economics,2022,Reexamining the evidence on gun ownership and homicide using proxy measures of ownership,"Karim Chalak, Daniel Kim, Megan Miller and John Pepper","Limited by the lack of data on gun ownership in the United States, ecological research linking firearms ownership rates to homicide often relies on proxy measures of ownership. Although the variable of interest is the gun ownership rate, not the proxy, the existing research does not formally account for the fact that the proxy is an error-ridden measure of the ownership rate. In this paper, we reexamine the ecological association between state-level gun ownership rates and homicide explicitly accounting for the measurement error in the proxy measure of ownership. To do this, we apply the results in Chalak and Kim (2020) to provide informative bounds on the mean association between rates of homicide and firearms ownership. In this setting, the estimated lower bound on the magnitude of the association corresponds to the conventional linear regression model estimate whereas the upper bound depends on prior information about the measurement error process. Our preferred model yields an upper bound on the gun homicide elasticity that is nearly three times larger than the fixed effects regression estimates that do not account for measurement error. Moreover, we consider three point-identified models that rely on earlier validation studies and on instrumental variables respectively, and find that the gun homicide elasticity nearly equals this upper bound. Thus, our results suggest that the association between gun homicide and ownership rates is substantially larger than found in the earlier literature.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000238
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Sources of inertia in the individual health insurance market,"Coleman Drake, Conor Ryan and Bryan Dowd","Consumers in private health insurance markets are highly inertial. The literature has repeatedly found consumers are willing to pay thousands of dollars to keep their health plan. However, the causes of inertia are not well understood, despite their importance in determining whether welfare can be improved by reducing inertia and which types of policies would be effective in doing so. Using administrative data from California’s Health Insurance Marketplace, we separately identify three sources of inertia—tastes for provider continuity, inattention, and hassle costs—using two-stage models of inattention and health plan choice. We find that eliminating inattention and hassle costs would reduce repeated health plan choice by 53 percentage points and that interventions to reduce inattention and hassle costs are complements. Inattention and hassle costs cost consumers over a billion dollars in foregone consumer surplus in 2018, roughly $1,790 per household per year or half the annual premium paid by the median household, with inattention accounting for the largest source of forgone surplus. We conclude that interventions to reduce inertial plan choice should jointly focus on hassle costs and particularly inattention, but not tastes for provider continuity.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272200024X

Conditional on some observable characteristics, funding availability is as-good-as-randomly assigned to callers. We link callers to healthcare utilization records and observe their inpatient hospital stays and emergency department visits. We find that referral to financial assistance has little effect on overall healthcare use–we can reject increases in total utilization greater than 7% of the base rate and decreases of more than 4%. This null effect can be explained, in part, by the fact that the income shock does not significantly change overall healthcare use among those not receiving assistance, suggesting that these individuals can insure health and healthcare demand against these shocks in other ways.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000287

In each version the growth rate exceeds the safe rate for one of four reasons – uninsured idiosyncratic risk, uninsured aggregate risk, policy uncertainty, and imperfect financial intermediation. Deficit finance does not directly address any of these problems. What works, respectively speaking, is progressive taxation, bilateral intergenerational risk-sharing, early policy resolution, and improved intermediation. The four examples thus show that seemingly free deficits may be more costly than they appear.

We argue that political repressions were more salient and visible to local communities living near forced labor camps (gulags), which symbolized the harshness of Stalin’s regime. Combining contemporary survey data with the geolocation of forced labor camps, we find that living near former gulags lowers present-day social trust and civic engagement. These effects are independent of living near places where Stalin’s victims were arrested. Moreover, they are above and beyond any experiences with war or civil conflict that the extant literature documents, indicating that the gulag system's repressiveness is a crucial trigger of the mistrust culture within the FSU countries today.

Our results are consistent with a negative shift in perceived detection risks and are driven by heterogeneous station characteristics. We can rule out alternative explanations such as incapacitation, crime displacement, and changes in police employment or strategies at the regional level. We argue that criminals are less deterred due to a lower visibility of the local police.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272200007X
Journal of Public Economics,2022,"COVID-19, college academic performance, and the flexible grading policy: A longitudinal analysis",Núria Rodriguez-Planas,"I use an unbalanced panel of over 11,000 academic records spanning from Spring 2017 to Spring 2020 to identify the difference in effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across lower- and higher-income students’ academic performance. Using difference-in-differences models and event study analyses with individual fixed effects, I find a differential effect by students’ pre-COVID-19 academic performance. Lower-income students in the bottom quartile of the Fall 2019 cumulative GPA distribution outperformed their higher-income peers with a 9% higher Spring 2020 GPA. This differential is fully explained by students’ use of the flexible grading policy with lower-income ones being 35% more likely to exercise the pass/fail option than their counterparts. While no such GPA advantage is observed among top-performing lower-income students, in the absence of the flexible grading policy these students would have seen their GPA decrease by 5% relative to their counterfactual pre-pandemic mean. I find suggestive evidence that this lower performance may be driven by lower-income top-performing students experiencing greater challenges with online learning. These students also reported a higher use of incompletes than their higher-income peers and being more concerned about maintaining (merit-based) financial aid.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272722000081

I use two empirical strategies to randomize the gender of legislators and text analysis to identify the topics of the legislation in the French Parliament from 2001 to 2017. Across the two Houses, I find consistent evidence that female legislators work on different topics than men. I show that they are most active on women’s issues while men seem more involved in military issues. I provide evidence that these differences partly stem from legislators’ individual interest.

We study an overhaul of public assistance in Pakistan that created a national database of household assets and used the data to means-test cash transfers, eliminating discretion in their allocation. We use difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity approaches to quantify the effect of this reform. Favoritism and transfers to wealthy households dropped; we estimate that the welfare benefits of the reform were seven times as large as its costs.

In a large field experiment, we find that IRS letters about free tax preparation modestly increased filing, with a large share of the new filers claiming the EITC and the CTC.

Does it vary across election types, political parties or electoral settings? Estimating these effects requires comprehensive data on spending across candidates, parties and elections, as well as identification strategies that handle the endogenous and strategic nature of campaign spending in multiparty systems. This paper provides novel contributions in both of these areas. We build a new comprehensive dataset of all French legislative and UK general elections over the 1993–2017 period. We propose new empirical specifications, including a new instrument that relies on the fact that candidates are differentially affected by regulation on the source of funding on which they depend the most. We find that an increase in spending per voter consistently improves candidates’ vote share, both at British and French elections, and that the effect is heterogeneous depending on candidates’ party. In particular, we show that spending by radical and extreme parties has much lower returns than spending by mainstream parties, and that this can be partly explained by the social stigma attached to extreme voting. Our findings help reconcile the conflicting results of the existing literature, and improve our understanding of why campaigns matter.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272100195X

Using data from long-running panel studies in Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Peru and Vietnam, we show that children with higher test scores at age 12 report more years of schooling and higher college attendance by ∼age 22 in every country. However, variation in test scores explain only ∼15–55% of the SES gap in years of completed schooling at age 22. A striking implication is that in every country, children from low SES backgrounds who are in the 80th percentile of test scores at age 12 have similar years of completed schooling at age 22 as children from high SES backgrounds who were at the 20th percentile of test scores.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721002061

Online education is an imperfect substitute for in-person learning, particularly for children from low-income families. Peer effects also change: schools allow children from different socio-economic backgrounds to mix together, and this effect is lost when schools are closed. Another factor is the response of parents, some of whom compensate for the changed environment through their own efforts, while others are unable to do so. We examine the interaction of these factors with the aid of a structural model of skill formation. We find that school closures have a large, persistent, and unequal effect on human capital accumulation. High school students from low-income neighborhoods suffer a learning loss of 0.4 standard deviations after a one-year school closure, whereas children from high-income neighborhoods initially remain unscathed. The channels operating through schools, peers, and parents all contribute to growing educational inequality during the pandemic.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721002103
Journal of Public Economics,2022,Who benefits from tax incentives? The heterogeneous wage incidence of a tax credit,"Clément Carbonnier, Clément Malgouyres, Loriane Py and Camille Urvoy","Do workers gain from lower business taxes, and why? We estimate how a large corporate income tax credit in France is passed on to wages and explore the firm- and employee-level underlying mechanisms. The amount of tax credit firms get depends on their payroll share of workers paid less than a wage threshold. Exposure to the policy thus varies both across workers depending on their wage and across firms depending on their wage structure. Using exhaustive employer-employee data, we find that half of the surplus generated by the reform falls onto workers. Wage gains load on incumbents in high-skill occupations. The wage earnings of low-skill workers—nearly all individually eligible—do not change. This heterogeneous wage incidence is unlikely to be driven by scale effects or skill complementarities. We find that the groups of workers benefiting from wage gains are also more likely to continue working for the same firm. Further, we show that firms do not change their wage-setting behavior in response to the individual eligibility status of workers. Overall, our results suggest that the wage incidence of the tax credit operated collectively through rent-sharing and benefited workers most costly to replace.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721002139

Merging information on the topology of the network with geocoded longitudinal data about individual social capital from 1997 to 2017, we show that access to fast Internet caused a significant decline in civic and political engagement.

A model of voter preferences over public spending tradeoffs provides individual-level testable hypotheses. The data come from an original survey that offered voters in seven Latin American countries binary choices between public spending options in education and security. Respondents with higher mistrust or impatience are more likely to choose transfers over public goods; more impatient respondents are also more likely to choose short-term spending over public investment. Within public goods, however, political mistrust and risk aversion can shift voter demand from current to investment spending. Randomized experiments providing information about the benefits of public investment have the expected average demand impacts, while respondents with high political mistrust or impatience show attenuated treatment effects.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721002152

Providers working for piece rates produce 18 percent more patient encounters, but only a small portion of this increase was due to individual responses to the incentives.

Using the fraction of gun-related suicides as a proxy for gun availability, we find that increased access to guns led to persistently higher murder rates.

Journal of Public Economics,2022,When the minimum wage really bites hard: The negative spillover effect on high-skilled workers,Terry Gregory and Ulrich Zierahn-Weilage,"Minimum wage levels are rising around the globe. To shed more light on the possible unintended side effects of higher wage floors, we study the impact of a minimum wage introduction on wages and employment in a quasi-experimental setting where the minimum wage is set extraordinarily high during an economic downturn. We identify treatment effects along different wage and skill groups and find positive wage and employment spillover effects for medium-skilled workers with salaries just above the minimum wage. More striking, we find negative wage and employment effects for high-skilled workers who are further up the wage distribution, followed by reduced returns to skills and industry skill supply. We explain these adjustments with a substitution-scale model that predicts negative spillover effects whenever labor-labor substitutions toward high-skilled workers are overcompensated by an overall decline in industry employment. Even though we focus on a specialized industry, we lay out the general conditions under which such unfavorable adjustments may occur in other contexts.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721002188

We build a formal model in which elites push the strategy when evidence on a policy issue goes against them such as during a political scandal. We characterize the “WOT trade-off” faced by initiators: immobilizing voters locks in the status quo and thereby prevents the public from enacting policy change the elite dislikes, but it also undermines future policy changes the elite may in fact like. We draw on a number of illustrations from discourse pushed by the Kremlin on Western media markets and from the informational environment in “diminished” democracies to demonstrate how our argument explains variation in the occurrence and intensity of conspiracy-spreading, one notable WOT strategy.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721002218

We find governors are on average 7.6% more likely to select a census tract as an Opportunity Zone when the tract’s state representative is a member of the governor’s political party. This effect is incremental to local demographic factors that increased the likelihood of selection, such as lower income levels and preceding improvements in local conditions. Selection of politically affiliated tracts is greatest in Republican-governed states, where the effect increases to 13.2%. Furthermore, we find two procedures used by some governors when selecting Opportunity Zones – proportional allocation across a state and delegation of initial nominations to local authorities – offset the role of political affiliation.

Members who vote for the proposal receive expressive utility, and all members pay a cost if the proposal is accepted. Committee members may have different depths of reasoning. Under certain sufficient conditions, the model predicts that features that reduce the probability of a member being pivotal – namely, larger committee size, or a more restrictive voting rule – raise the share of votes in favour of the proposal.
