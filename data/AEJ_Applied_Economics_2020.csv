AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,War of the Waves: Radio and Resistance during World War II,"Stefano Gagliarducci, Massimiliano Onorato, Francesco Sobbrio and Guido Tabellini","We analyze the role of the media in coordinating and mobilizing insurgency against an authoritarian regime, in the context of the Nazi-fascist occupation of Italy during WWII. We study the effect of BBC radio on the intensity of internal resistance. By exploiting variations in monthly sunspot activity that affect the sky-wave propagation of BBC broadcasting toward Italy, we show that BBC radio had a strong impact on political violence. We provide further evidence to document that BBC radio played an important role in coordinating resistance activities but had no lasting role in motivating the population against the Nazi-fascist regime.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190410
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,"E-governance, Accountability, and Leakage in Public Programs: Experimental Evidence from a Financial Management Reform in India","Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, Clément Imbert, Santhosh Mathew and Rohini Pande","Can e-governance reforms improve government policy? By making information available on a real-time basis, information technologies may reduce the theft of public funds. We analyze a large field experiment and the nationwide scale-up of a reform to India's workfare program. Advance payments were replaced by ""just-in-time"" payments, triggered by e-invoicing, making it easier to detect misreporting. Leakages went down: program expenditures dropped by 24 percent, while employment slightly increased; there were fewer fake households in the official database; and program officials' personal wealth fell by 10 percent. However, payment delays increased. The nationwide scale-up resulted in a persistent 19 percent reduction in program expenditure.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180302
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,The Not-So-Hot Melting Pot: The Persistence of Outcomes for Descendants of the Age of Mass Migration,Zachary Ward,"How persistent are economic gaps across ethnicities? The convergence of ethnic gaps through the third generation of immigrants is difficult to measure because few datasets include grandparental birthplace. I overcome this limitation with a new three-generational dataset that links immigrant grandfathers in 1880 to their grandsons in 1940. I find that the persistence of ethnic gaps in occupational income is 2.5 times stronger than predicted by a standard grandfather-grandson elasticity. While part of the discrepancy is due to measurement error attenuating the grandfather-grandson elasticity, mechanisms related to geography also partially explain the stronger persistence of ethnic occupational differentials.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20170382
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,The Elasticity of Science,Kyle Myers,"This paper identifies the degree to which scientists are willing to change the direction of their work in exchange for resources. Data from the National Institutes of Health are used to estimate how scientists respond to targeted funding opportunities. Inducing a scientist to change their direction by a small amount—to work on marginally different topics—requires a substantial amount of funding in expectation. The switching costs of science are large. The productivity of grants is also estimated, and it appears the additional costs of targeted research may be more than offset by more productive scientists pursuing these grants.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180518
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Increasing Access to Selective High Schools through Place-Based Affirmative Action: Unintended Consequences,"Lisa Barrow, Lauren Sartain and Marisa  de la Torre","We investigate whether elite Chicago public high schools differentially benefit high-achieving students from more and less affluent neighborhoods. Chicago's place-based affirmative action policy allocates seats based on achievement and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES). Using regression discontinuity design (RDD), we find that these schools do not raise test scores overall, but students are generally more positive about their high school experiences. For students from low-SES neighborhoods, we estimate negative effects on grades and the probability of attending a selective college. We present suggestive evidence that these findings for students from low-SES neighborhoods are driven by the negative effect of relative achievement ranking.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20170599
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Rules for Recovery: Impact of Indexed Disaster Funds on Shock Coping in Mexico,"Alejandro del Valle, Alain de Janvry and Elisabeth Sadoulet","Government provision of disaster transfers is typically hampered by liquidity constraints and by weak rules and administrative capacity to disburse reconstruction resources. We show that by easing these hurdles, Mexico's indexed disaster fund (Fonden) considerably accelerates economic recovery after a disaster. To estimate Fonden impact on recovery, as measured by night lights, we exploit the heavy rainfall index that determines program eligibility. We find that for one year after a disaster, eligible municipalities are 6 percent brighter than those ineligible, with gains likely concentrated among less resilient municipalities. We additionally document how Fonden rules shield resources from political abuse.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190002
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Healthcare Demand under Simple Prices: Evidence from Tiered Hospital Networks,Elena Prager,"This paper shows that consumers respond to prices for complex healthcare when they can easily assess out-of-pocket prices. Healthcare cost containment efforts increasingly incentivize price shopping despite a dearth of evidence that this steers consumers toward lower-priced care for major medical services. I show that consumers shift toward lower-priced hospitals in the highly simplified price information environment of insurance plans with tiered hospital networks. Consumers observe a single predictable, well-defined price that applies to a broad range of services within each of at most three hospital tiers. Within three years, expected partial-equilibrium savings reach 8–17 percent of baseline spending.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180422

We employ a regression-discontinuity-based event study in a sample of 758 worldwide post-1945 national elections, using existing data on parliamentary elections and newly collected data on presidential elections. Left-wing electoral victories cause significant and substantial short-term decreases in stock market valuations, while the response of sovereign bond markets is mostly muted. Stock market effects are stronger and more persistent in elections in which the left's proposed economic policy is more radical and in developing economies.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190292
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,"Job Displacement, Family Dynamics, and Spousal Labor Supply","Martin Halla, Julia Schmieder and Andrea Weber","We study the effectiveness of intrahousehold insurance among married couples when the husband loses his job due to a mass layoff or plant closure. Empirical results based on Austrian administrative data show that husbands suffer persistent employment and earnings losses, while wives' labor supply increases moderately due to extensive margin responses. Wives' earnings gains recover only a tiny fraction of the household income loss, and in the short-term, public transfers and taxes are a more important form of insurance. We show that the presence of children in the household is a crucial determinant of the wives' labor supply response.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180671
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,The Impact of Insurance Expansions on the Already Insured: The Affordable Care Act and Medicare,"Colleen M. Carey, Sarah Miller and Laura Wherry","Some states have not adopted the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions due to concerns that the expansions may impair access to care and utilization for those who are already insured. We investigate such negative spillovers using a large panel of Medicare beneficiaries. Across many subgroups and outcomes, we find no evidence that the expansions reduced utilization among Medicare beneficiaries and can rule out all but very small changes in utilization or spending. These results indicate that the expansions in Medicaid did not impair access to care or utilization for the Medicare population.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20190176
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,The Impact of Information Technology on the Diffusion of New Pharmaceuticals,"Kenneth Arrow, L. Kamran Bilir and Alan Sorensen","Do information differences across US physicians contribute to treatment disparities? This paper uses a unique new dataset to evaluate how changes in physician access to a decision-relevant drug database affect prescribing decisions. Our results indicate doctors using the reference have a significantly greater propensity to prescribe generic drugs, are faster to begin prescribing new generics, and prescribe a more diverse set of products. These results are consistent with database users responding primarily to the increased accessibility of non-clinical information such as pricing and insurance formulary data, and suggest improvements to physician information access have important implications for aggregate healthcare costs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20170647
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,The Value of Reference Letters: Experimental Evidence from South Africa,"Martin Abel, Rulof Burger and Patrizio Piraino","We show that reference letters from former employers alleviate information frictions in a low-skill labor market, improving applicant screening and gender equity. A resume audit study finds that using a reference letter in the application increases callbacks by 60 percent. Women drive the effect. Letters are effective because they provide valuable information about workers' skills that employers use to select applicants of higher ability. A second experiment, which encourages job seekers to obtain and use a reference letter, finds consistent results. In particular, reference letters raise job interviews and employment for women.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180666
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Multilateral Trade Bargaining: A First Look at the GATT Bargaining Records,"Kyle Bagwell, Robert Staiger and Ali Yurukoglu","This paper empirically examines recently declassified tariff bargaining data from the GATT/WTO. Focusing on the Torquay Round (1950–1951), we document stylized facts about these interconnected high-stakes international negotiations that suggest a lack of strategic behavior among the participating governments and an important multilateral element to the bilateral bargains. We suggest that these features can be understood as emerging from a tariff bargaining forum that emphasizes the GATT pillars of MFN and multilateral reciprocity, and we offer evidence that the relaxation of strict bilateral reciprocity facilitated by the GATT multilateral bargaining forum was important to the success of the GATT approach.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20170574
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Fenced Out: The Impact of Border Construction on US-Mexico Migration,Benjamin Feigenberg,"This paper estimates the impact of the US-Mexico border fence on US-Mexico migration by exploiting variation in the timing and location of US government investment in fence construction. Using Mexican survey data and data I collected on fence construction, I find that construction in a municipality reduces migration by 27 percent for municipality residents and 15 percent for residents of adjacent municipalities. In addition, construction reduces migration by up to 35 percent from non-border municipalities. I also find that construction induces migrants to substitute toward alternative crossing locations, disproportionately deters low-skilled migrants, and reduces the number of undocumented Mexicans in the United States.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20170231
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Front-Loading the Unemployment Benefit: An Empirical Assessment,Attila Lindner and Balazs Reizer,"We estimate the effect of front-loading unemployment benefit payments on nonemployment duration and reemployment wages. Exploiting a sharp change in the path of benefits for those who claimed unemployment benefits after November 1, 2005 in Hungary, we show that nonemployment duration fell by two weeks, while reemployment wages rose by 1.4 percent as a result of front-loading. We show that these behavioral responses were large enough to offset the mechanical cost increase of the unemployment insurance. We argue that our results indicate that benefit front-loading was a Pareto improving policy reform as both unemployed and employed workers were made better off.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180138
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,The Competitive Effects of Entry: Evidence from Supercenter Expansion,"Peter Arcidiacono, Paul B. Ellickson, Carl F. Mela and John Singleton","Coupling weekly grocery transactions with the exact location and opening date of Walmarts over an 11-year period, we examine how Supercenter entry affects prices and revenues at incumbent supermarkets. We find that entry within 1 mile of an incumbent causes a sharp 16 percent drop in revenue, a competitive effect that decays quickly with distance. Surprisingly, despite large cross-sectional differences in supermarket prices by exposure to Walmart, our findings also indicate that Supercenter entry has no causal effect on incumbent prices. This result is robust across many dimensions, including a lack of price response for individual products, and across brands within a category.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180047
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Prestige Matters: Wage Premium and Value Addition in Elite Colleges,Sheetal Sekhri,"This paper provides evidence that graduates of elite public institutions in India have an earnings advantage in the labor market even though attending these colleges has no discernible effect on academic outcomes. Admission to the elite public colleges is based on the scores obtained in the Senior Secondary School Examinations. I exploit this feature in a regression discontinuity design. Using administrative data on admission and college test scores and an in-depth survey, I find that the salaries of elite public college graduates are higher at the admission cutoff although the exit test scores are no different.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20140105
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Gender Differences in the Choice of Major: The Importance of Female Role Models,Catherine Porter and Danila Serra,"We conducted a field experiment aimed at increasing the percentage of women majoring in economics. We exposed students enrolled in introductory classes to successful and charismatic women who majored in economics at the same university. The intervention significantly impacted female students' enrollment in further economics classes, increasing their likelihood to major in economics by 8 percentage points. This is a large effect, given that only 9 percent of women were majoring in economics at baseline. Since the impacted women were previously planning to major in lower-earning fields, our low-cost intervention may have a positive effect on their future incomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180426
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,What Is the Added Value of Preschool for Poor Children? Long-Term and Intergenerational Impacts and Interactions with an Infant Health Intervention,Maya Rossin-Slater and Miriam Wüst,"We study the impact of preschool targeted at children from low-income families over the life cycle and across generations, and examine its interaction with an infant health intervention. Using Danish administrative data with variation in the timing of program implementation over the period 1933–1960, we find lasting benefits of access to preschool on adult educational attainment, earnings, and survival beyond age 65. We also show that children of women exposed to preschool obtain more education by age 25. However, exposure to a nurse home visiting program in infancy reduces the added value of preschool, implying that the programs serve as partial substitutes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180698
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,One in a Million: Field Experiments on Perceived Closeness of the Election and Voter Turnout,"Alan Gerber, Mitchell Hoffman, John Morgan and Collin Raymond","During the 2010 gubernatorial elections, we elicit voter beliefs about the closeness of the election before and after showing different polls, which, depending on treatment, indicate a close or not-close race. Subjects update their beliefs in response to polls, but overestimate the probability of a very close election. However, turnout is unaffected by beliefs about election closeness. A follow-up RCT, conducted during the 2014 gubernatorial elections at much larger scale, also points to little relationship between poll information about closeness and turnout. We caveat that the strength of our evidence depends on assumptions regarding our treatments' impacts on beliefs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180574

We show that the transformation of the US labor market away from routine cognitive and manual tasks and toward nonroutine interactive and analytic tasks has been larger than prior research has found, with a substantial fraction of total changes occurring within narrowly defined job titles.

We examine this question in the context of floods, which displaced more than 650 million people worldwide in the last 35 years. We study large urban floods using spatially detailed inundation maps and night lights data spanning the globe's cities. We find that low-elevation urban areas are flooded more frequently, and yet they concentrate more economic activity per square kilometer. When cities are flooded, low-elevation areas recover as rapidly as those higher up. With the exception of recently populated urban areas, we find little permanent movement of economic activity in response to floods.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20170066
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Politics in the Family: Nepotism and the Hiring Decisions of Italian Firms,Stefano Gagliarducci and Marco Manacorda,"This paper studies the effect of family connections to politicians on individuals' labor market outcomes. Using data for Italy spanning more than three decades on a sample of almost one million individuals plus data on the universe of individuals holding political office, we show that politicians extract significant rents, in terms of private sector jobs, for their family members. We present evidence consistent with the hypothesis that this phenomenon is a form of corruption, i.e., a quid pro quo exchange between firms and politicians, although arguably an inferior substitute for easier-to-detect modes of rent appropriation on the part of politicians.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20170778
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Compliance Behavior in Networks: Evidence from a Field Experiment,"Francesco Drago, Friederike Mengel and Christian Traxler","This paper studies the spread of compliance behavior in neighborhood networks in Austria. We exploit a field experiment that varied the content of mailings sent to potential evaders of TV license fees. The data reveal a strong treatment spillover: untreated households are more likely to switch from evasion to compliance in response to mailings received by their network neighbors. Digging deeper into the properties of the spillover, we find that it is concentrated among close neighbors of the targets and increases with the treated households' diffusion centrality. Local concentration of equally treated households implies a lower spillover.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20170690
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,"Charging Ahead: Prepaid Metering, Electricity Use, and Utility Revenue",Kelsey Jack and Grant Smith,"Monthly bills for services such as electricity often go unpaid in developing countries. Prepaid meters offer a potential technological solution. In Cape Town, South Africa, over 4,000 residential customers on monthly billing were switched to prepaid metering, with random variation in the timing of the switch. In response, electricity use falls by 14 percent, driven at least in part by an increase in marginal price sensitivity. The decrease in revenue to the municipal electric utility is more than offset by lower revenue recovery costs. Switching poorer and more in-debt customers generates the greatest net revenue gains to the utility.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180155
AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Gender Homophily in Referral Networks: Consequences for the Medicare Physician Earnings Gap,Dan Zeltzer,"I assess the extent to which the gender gap in physician earnings may be driven by physicians' preference for referring to specialists of the same gender. Analyzing administrative data on 100 million Medicare patient referrals, I provide robust evidence that doctors refer more to specialists of their own gender. I show that biased referrals are predominantly driven by physicians' decisions rather than by endogenous sorting of physicians or patients. Because most referring doctors are male, the net impact of same-gender bias by both male and female doctors generates lower demand for female relative to male specialists, pointing to a positive externality for increased female participation in medicine.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180201

Evidence from India,"Nicholas Bloom, Aprajit Mahajan, David McKenzie and John Roberts","We revisited Indian weaving firms nine years after a randomized experiment that changed their management practices. While about half of the practices adopted in the original experimental plants had been dropped, there was still a large and significant gap in practices between the treatment and control plants, suggesting lasting impacts of effective management interventions. Few practices had spread across the firms in the study, but many had spread within firms. Managerial turnover and the lack of director time were two of the most cited reasons for the drop in management practices, highlighting the importance of key employees.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180369

Interferences resulted when two or more independent parties submitted identical claims of invention nearly simultaneously. Following the idea that inventors of identical inventions share common knowledge inputs, interferences provide a new method for measuring knowledge spillovers. Interfering inventors are 1.4 to 4.0 times more likely to live in the same local area than matched control pairs of inventors.

We also develop a methodology to estimate the incidence of input taxes that accounts for incomplete pass-through, imperfect competition, and substitution among inputs. For the several industries we study, 70 percent of energy price-driven changes in input costs get passed through to consumers in the short to medium run. The share of the welfare cost that consumers bear is 25–75 percent smaller (and the share producers bear is larger) than models featuring complete pass-through and perfect competition would suggest.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180474

Our method uses information on bunching in the earnings distribution at convex budget set kinks before and after policy-induced changes in the magnitude of the kinks: the larger is the adjustment cost, the smaller is the absolute change in bunching from before to after the policy change.

Opposite sides of boundaries between voting precincts are observationally identical, except for their assigned polling locations. This discontinuous assignment produces sharp changes in voters' travel distance to cast their ballots. In nine municipalities in Massachusetts and Minnesota, a 1 standard deviation (0.245 mile) increase in distance reduces ballots cast by 2 to 5 percent across four elections.

Notably, Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) overwhelmingly purchase patents granted by ""lenient"" examiners. These examiners issue patents that are more likely to be litigated by both PAEs and conventional companies, and that also have higher invalidity rates. PAEs leverage a specific friction in the patent system that stems from lenient examiners and affects litigation more broadly.

AEJ: Applied Economics,2020,Educational Investment Responses to Economic Opportunity: Evidence from Indian Road Construction,"Anjali Adukia, Sam Asher and Paul Novosad","The rural poor in developing countries, once economically isolated, are increasingly being connected to outside markets. Whether these new connections crowd out or encourage educational investment is a central question. We examine the effects on educational choices of 115,000 new roads built under India's flagship road construction program. We find that children stay in school longer and perform better on standardized exams. Heterogeneity in treatment effects supports a standard human capital investment model: enrollment increases most when nearby labor markets offer high returns to educationand least when they imply high opportunity costs of schooling.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180036
