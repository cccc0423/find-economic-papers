Journal of Political Economy,2022,The Comparative Advantage of Firms,"Johannes Boehm, Swati Dhingra and John Morrow","Resource-based theories propose that firms grow by diversifying into products that use common capabilities. We provide evidence for common-input capabilities, using a policy that removed entry barriers in input markets to show that the similarity of a firm’s and an industry’s input mix determines firm production choices. We model industry choice and economies of scope from input capabilities. When the model is estimated for Indian manufacturing, input complementarities make firms 5% more likely to produce in an industry and are quantitatively as important as time-invariant drivers of coproduction rates. Upstream entry barriers were equivalent to a 9.5% tariff on inputs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720630
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Exit versus Voice,"Eleonora Broccardo, Oliver Hart and Luigi Zingales","We study the relative effectiveness of exit (divestment and boycott) and voice (engagement) strategies in a world where companies generate externalities and some agents care about the social impact of their decisions. We show that if the majority of investors are even slightly socially responsible, voice achieves the socially optimal outcome. In contrast, exit does not unless everybody is significantly socially responsible. If the majority of investors are purely selfish, exit is a more effective strategy, but neither strategy generally achieves the first best. We also show that exit can sometimes reduce social welfare.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720516
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Asset Management Contracts and Equilibrium Prices,"Andrea M. Buffa, Dimitri Vayanos and Paul Woolley","We model asset management as a continuum between active and passive: managers can deviate from benchmark indices to exploit noise trader–induced distortions, but agency frictions constrain these deviations. Because constraints force managers to buy assets that they underweight when these assets appreciate, overvalued assets have high volatility, and the risk-return relationship becomes inverted. Distortions are more severe for overvalued assets than for undervalued ones because trading against the former entails more risk and tighter constraints. We provide empirical evidence supporting our model’s main mechanisms. Using the data, we infer the constraints’ tightness and compute a measure of effective arbitrage capital.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720515
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Vertical Contracts with Endogenous Product Selection: An Empirical Analysis of Vendor Allowance Contracts,Sylvia Hristakeva,"Producers frequently provide retailers with financial incentives to secure product distribution. These payments often take the form of vendor allowances: lump-sum transfers to retailers that do not directly depend on quantity sold. I introduce an estimation strategy that uses observed product selections to inform unobserved allowances. I use retailers’ replacement threats, which may allow them to capture both vendor transfers and lower wholesale prices. A counterfactual restricts firms to contract on only wholesale prices. Results show that vendor allowances may have not only (negative) product distortion effects but also (potentially positive) pricing effects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720631
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Breaking the Cycle? Intergenerational Effects of an Antipoverty Program in Early Childhood,Andrew Barr and Chloe Gibbs,"Despite substantial evidence that resources and outcomes are transmitted across generations, there has been limited inquiry into the extent to which antipoverty programs actually disrupt the cycle of bad outcomes. We leverage the rollout of the United States’s largest early-childhood program, Head Start, to estimate the effect of early-childhood exposure among mothers on their children’s long-term outcomes. We find evidence of intergenerational transmission of effects in the form of increased educational attainment, reduced teen pregnancy, and reduced criminal engagement in the second generation. These effects correspond to an estimated increase in discounted second-generation wages of 6%–11%, depending on specification. Exploration of earlier outcomes suggests an important role for changes in parenting behavior and potential noncognitive channels.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720764
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Aggregate Implications of Changing Sectoral Trends,"Andrew Foerster, Andreas Hornstein, Pierre-Daniel G. Sarte and Mark W. Watson","We describe how capital accumulation and the network structure of US production interact to amplify the effects of sectoral trend growth rates in total factor productivity and labor on trend GDP (gross domestic product) growth. We derive expressions that conveniently summarize this long-run amplification effect by way of sectoral multipliers. We estimate that sector-specific factors have historically accounted for approximately three-fourths of long-run changes in GDP growth. Trend GDP growth fell by nearly 3 percentage points over the postwar period, with especially significant contributions from the Construction sector in 1950–80 and the Durable Goods sector in 2000–2018. No sector has contributed any steady significant increase to the trend growth rate of GDP in the past 70 years.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720763
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Within-Firm Productivity Dispersion: Estimates and Implications,Scott Orr,"This paper develops a flexible recipe for identifying unobserved input allocations, as well as quantity- and revenue-based total factor productivity (TFP) across product lines, for multiproduct producers, using demand- and supply-side information. Applying variants of this recipe to a panel of plants manufacturing machinery in India from 2000–2007 yields sizable within-plant TFP differences. Removing an average plant’s lowest-performing product increases the unweighted average of plant-level revenue-based productivity by 10%–65%. A 1 standard deviation decline in product-level revenue-based TFP generates around a 6 percentage point increase in the probability of dropping that product.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720465
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Central Bank Digital Currency: Welfare and Policy Implications,Stephen Williamson,"A model of banking and means of payment is constructed to analyze the effects of the introduction of central bank digital currency (CBDC). That CBDC is interest bearing is not an advantage, as replacement of physical currency with CBDC does not expand the attainable set of equilibrium allocations. CBDC can increase welfare by competing with private means of payment and shifting safe assets from the private banking sector to what is effectively a narrow banking facility. This uses the aggregate stock of safe collateral more efficiently, given incentive problems in private banking.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720457
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Poor and Rational: Decision-Making under Scarcity,"Dietmar Fehr, Günther Fink and B. Kelsey Jack","We investigate the link between poverty and decision-making in a sample of farmers in Zambia, who were given the opportunity to exchange randomly assigned household items for alternative items of similar value. Analyzing a total of 5,842 trading decisions and leveraging multiple sources of variation in financial constraints, we show that exchange asymmetries decrease in magnitude when participants are more constrained. This result is robust to experimental procedures and is not mediated by changes in cognitive performance. Consistent with the interpretation that scarcity leads to more rational decisions by increasing the utility loss from forgone trading, we show that trading probabilities go up when the market value of the items is exogenously increased.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720466
Journal of Political Economy,2022,"Caring or Pretending to Care? Social Impact, Firms’ Objectives, and Welfare",Michele Fioretti,"Many firms claim that “social impact” influences their strategies. This paper develops a structural model that quantifies social impact as the sum of surpluses to a firm and its stakeholders. With data from a for-profit firm whose prosocial expenditures are measurable and salient to consumers, the analysis shows that the firm spends prosocially beyond profit maximization, thereby increasing welfare substantially. Incentivizing a standard profit-maximizing firm to behave similarly would require subsidies amounting to 58% of its prosocial expenditures, because consumers’ willingness to pay is relatively inelastic to prosocial expenses. Therefore, social impact resembles a self-imposed welfare-enhancing tax with limited pass-through.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720459
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Mismatch Cycles,"Isaac Baley, Ana Figueiredo and Robert Ulbricht","This paper studies the cyclical dynamics of skill mismatch and quantifies its impact on labor productivity. We build a tractable directed search model, in which workers differ in skills along multiple dimensions and sort into jobs with heterogeneous skill requirements. Skill mismatch arises because of information frictions and is prolonged by search frictions. Estimated to the United States, the model replicates salient business cycle properties of mismatch. Job transitions in and out of bottom job rungs, combined with career mobility, are key to account for the empirical fit. The model provides a novel narrative for the scarring effect of unemployment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720461
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Electoral Accountability and Control in US Cities,Holger Sieg and Chamna Yoon,"We consider a dynamic game of electoral competition with adverse selection, moral hazard, and imperfect monitoring. We show that this dynamic game can be estimated using a flexible maximum likelihood estimator. We implement the estimator using data from recent mayoral elections in large US cities with binding two-term limits. Our empirical findings suggest that there are large differences in performance among different types of mayors. We find an economically important degree of policy responsiveness, with effort accounting for a larger fraction of the total effect than selection. Finally, we evaluate several institutional reforms that promise to increase policy responsiveness.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720514
Journal of Political Economy,2022,The Effects of High-Skilled Immigration Policy on Firms: Evidence from Visa Lotteries,"Kirk Doran, Alexander Gelber and Adam Isen","We compare winning and losing firms in lotteries for H-1B visas, matching administrative data on these lotteries to administrative tax data on US firms and to approved US patents. Winning one additional H-1B visa crowds out about 1.5 other workers at the firm. Additional H-1Bs have insignificant and at most modest effects on firm innovation. More general evidence from the universe of US firms and the universe of H-1B visas using alternative estimation strategies is consistent with these results. Firms that hire H-1Bs grow faster and innovate more because they are different in other ways from firms that do not.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720467
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Equilibrium Trade in Automobiles,"Kenneth Gillingham, Fedor Iskhakov, Anders Munk-Nielsen, John Rust and Bertel Schjerning","We introduce a computationally tractable dynamic equilibrium model of automobile markets with heterogeneous consumers, focused on stationary flow equilibria. We introduce a fast, robust algorithm for computing equilibria and use it to estimate a model using nearly 39 million observations on car ownership transitions from Denmark. The estimated model fits the data well, and counterfactual simulations show that Denmark could raise total tax revenue by reducing the new-car registration tax rate. We show that reducing this tax rate while raising the tax rate on fuel increases aggregate welfare, tax revenue, and car ownership, while reducing car ages, driving, and CO2 emissions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720463
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Non-Bayesian Persuasion,Geoffroy de Clippel and Xu Zhang,"Following Kamenica and Gentzkow, this paper studies persuasion as an information design problem. We investigate how mistakes in probabilistic inference impact optimal persuasion. The concavification method is shown to extend naturally to a large class of belief updating rules, which we identify and characterize. This class comprises many non-Bayesian models discussed in the literature. We apply this new technique to gain insight into the revelation principle, the ranking of updating rules, when persuasion is beneficial to the sender, and when it is detrimental to the receiver. Our key result also extends to shed light on the question of robust persuasion.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720464
Journal of Political Economy,2022,"Cognitive Skills, Strategic Sophistication, and Life Outcomes","Eduardo Fé, David Gill and Victoria Prowse","We investigate how childhood cognitive skills affect strategic sophistication and adult outcomes, and we emphasize the importance of childhood theory of mind. Experimental data show that (i) theory-of-mind ability and cognitive ability both predict level k behavior, (ii) older children respond to information about the cognitive ability of their opponent, and (iii) theory of mind (but not cognitive ability) predicts whether children respond to intentions. Using longitudinal data, we find that childhood theory of mind and cognitive ability are both associated with enhanced adult social skills, higher educational participation, better educational attainment, and lower fertility in young adulthood. Finally, we provide evidence that school spending improves theory of mind.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720460

Journal of Political Economy,2022,How Much Should We Trust the Dictator’s GDP Growth Estimates?,Luis Martinez,"I study the overstatement of economic growth in autocracies by comparing self-reported GDP figures to night-time light recorded by satellites from outer space. I show that the night-time-light elasticity of GDP is larger in authoritarian regimes, even accounting for differences in multiple country characteristics. This autocracy gradient in the elasticity is greater when the incentive to exaggerate economic growth is stronger or when the constraints on exaggeration are weaker. The results suggest that autocracies overstate yearly GDP growth by approximately 35%. Adjusting the data for manipulation leads to a more nuanced view on the recent economic success of autocracies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720458
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Taxing Top Incomes in a World of Ideas,Charles Jones,"This paper considers top income taxation when (i) new ideas drive economic growth, (ii) the reward for successful innovation is a top income, and (iii) innovation cannot be perfectly targeted by a research subsidy—think about the business methods of Walmart, the creation of Uber, or the “idea” of Amazon. These conditions lead to a new force affecting the optimal top tax rate: by slowing the creation of new ideas that drive aggregate GDP, top income taxation reduces everyone’s income, not just income at the top. This force sharply constrains both revenue-maximizing and welfare-maximizing top tax rates.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720394
Journal of Political Economy,2022,The Economic Effects of Long-Term Climate Change: Evidence from the Little Ice Age,Maria Waldinger,"Recent studies consistently find important economic effects of year-to-year weather fluctuations. I study the economic effects of long-term and gradual climate change over 250 years in the Little Ice Age (1600–1850), during which people and economies had time to adapt. Results show significant negative economic effects of long-term climate change. Temperature impacted the economy through its effect on agricultural productivity and mortality. To adapt to the Little Ice Age, economies increased trade and changed land use. I discuss the relevance of these results for understanding the impact of today’s climate change, especially in developing countries.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720393
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Minimum Wage and Individual Worker Productivity: Evidence from a Large US Retailer,"Decio Coviello, Erika Deserranno and Nicola Persico","We study workers who are employed by a large US retailer, work in many store locations, and are paid based on performance. By means of a border-discontinuity analysis, we document that workers become more productive and are terminated less often after a minimum wage increase. These effects are stronger among workers whose pay is more often supported by the minimum wage. However, when workers are monitored less intensely, the minimum wage depresses productivity. We interpret these findings through an efficiency wage model. After a minimum wage increase, profits decrease, and a calibration exercise suggests that worker welfare increases.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720397
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Economic Preferences across Generations and Family Clusters: A Large-Scale Experiment in a Developing Country,"Shyamal Chowdhury, Matthias Sutter and Klaus Zimmermann","Our large-scale experiment with 542 families from rural Bangladesh finds substantial intergenerational persistence of economic preferences. Both mothers’ and fathers’ risk, time, and social preferences are significantly (and largely to the same degree) positively correlated with their children’s economic preferences, even when controlling for personality traits and socioeconomic background. We discuss possible transmission channels and are the first to classify all families into one of two clusters, with either relatively patient, risk-tolerant, and prosocial members or relatively impatient, risk averse, and spiteful members. Classifications correlate with socioeconomic background variables. We find that our results differ from evidence for rich countries.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720395
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Behavioral Foundations of Nested Stochastic Choice and Nested Logit,Matthew Kovach and Gerelt Tserenjigmid,"We provide the first behavioral characterization of nested logit, a foundational and widely applied discrete-choice model, through the introduction of a nonparametric version of nested logit that we call “nested stochastic choice” (NSC). NSC is characterized by a single axiom that weakens independence of irrelevant alternatives on the basis of revealed similarity to allow for the similarity effect. Nested logit is characterized by an additional menu-independence axiom. Our axiomatic characterization leads to a practical, data-driven algorithm that identifies the true nest structure from choice data. We also discuss limitations of generalizing nested logit by studying the testable implications of cross-nested logit.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720399
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Child Development in Parent-Child Interactions,Avner Seror,"I present a model of child development that highlights the effect of parent-child interactions on the formation of skills. Through the parent’s affection, the child learns and builds mental representations of the self as loved and competent. These mental representations shape the child’s noncognitive skills and foster learning. I show that this model provides a unifying explanation for well-established evidence on child development. The model also sheds light on how early exposure to media devices can negatively impact skill acquisition. I discuss implications for the design of policies to reduce inequalities in child development.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720398
Journal of Political Economy,2022,The Allocation of Food to Food Banks,Canice Prendergast,"Feeding America allocates donated food to over 200 food banks. In 2005, it transitioned from a queueing mechanism to one where food banks use a specialized currency to bid for food. Food banks chose very different food than they received before. Small food banks acquired 72% more pounds per client than large food banks at little nutritional cost. This reallocation of food is estimated to have increased its value by 21%, or $115 million per annum. Food banks also sourced food much closer, saving an additional $16 million per annum. Finally, donations of food rose by over 100 million pounds.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720332
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Designing Incentives for Heterogeneous Researchers,Nathan Yoder,"A principal (e.g., the US government) contracts with a researcher with unknown costs (e.g., a vaccine developer) to conduct a costly experiment. This contracting problem has a novel feature that captures the difference between the form of an experiment and the strength of its results: researchers face a problem of information design rather than optimal effort. Using a novel comparative static for Bayesian persuasion settings, I characterize the optimal contract and show how experimentation is distorted by the need to screen researchers. Moreover, I show that there is no loss from contracting on the experiment’s result rather than the experiment itself.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720072
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Asymmetric Information and Sovereign Debt: Theory Meets Mexican Data,"Harold Cole, Daniel Neuhann and Guillermo Ordonez","Using bid-level data from discriminatory auctions for Mexican government bonds, we demonstrate that asymmetric information about default risk is a key friction in sovereign bond markets. We document that large bidders achieve higher bid-acceptance rates than other bidders despite paying no more for executed bids. We then propose a new model of primary markets in which investors may differ in wealth, risk aversion, market power, and information. Only asymmetric information can qualitatively account for our empirical finding, and asymmetric information about rare disasters can quantitatively match bidding and yield moments. Counterfactuals reveal substantial effects of asymmetric information on yields.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720139
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Sorting or Steering: The Effects of Housing Discrimination on Neighborhood Choice,Peter Christensen and Christopher Timmins,"Growing evidence indicates that neighborhoods affect human capital accumulation, raising concern that the exclusionary effects of housing discrimination could contribute to persistent inequality in the United States. Using data from HUD’s most recent Housing Discrimination Study and microlevel data on neighborhood attributes in 28 US cities, we find that minorities are steered toward neighborhoods with less economic opportunity and greater exposures to crime and pollution. Holding preferences and income constant, discriminatory steering alone can explain a disproportionate number of minority households found in high-poverty neighborhoods in the United States and the higher exposure of African American mothers to toxic pollutants.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720140
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Instrumental Variable Identification of Dynamic Variance Decompositions,Mikkel Plagborg-Moller and Christian Wolf,"Macroeconomists increasingly use external sources of exogenous variation for causal inference. However, unless such external instruments (proxies) capture the underlying shock without measurement error, existing methods are silent on the importance of that shock for macroeconomic fluctuations. We show that, in a general moving-average model with external instruments, variance decompositions for the instrumented shock are interval-identified, with informative bounds. Various additional restrictions guarantee point identification of both variance and historical decompositions. Unlike structural vector autoregression analysis, our methods do not require invertibility. Applied to US data, they give a tight upper bound on the importance of monetary shocks for inflation dynamics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720141

In the data, 8/10 of the average equity premium is attributable to monthly returns below −10%, but returns below −30% matter very little. In contrast, prominent asset pricing models based on habits, long-run risks, rare disasters, undiversifiable idiosyncratic risk, and constrained intermediaries attribute the premium predominantly to returns above −10% or to the extreme left tail. We show that the discrepancy arises from an unrealistically small price of risk for stock market tail events in the models.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720396

In comprehensive data for Belgium, firms with more customers have higher total sales but lower sales and lower market shares per customer. Downstream factors, especially the number of customers, explain the vast majority of firm size dispersion. We rationalize these facts with a model of network formation and two-dimensional firm heterogeneity. Higher productivity generates more matches and larger market shares among customers. Higher relationship capability generates more customers and higher sales. Model estimates suggest a strong negative correlation between productivity and relationship capability and potentially large welfare gains from improving relationship capability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719759

Incentives for banks to contribute to a voluntary bail-in arise from their exposure to financial contagion. In equilibrium, a bail-in is possible only if the regulator’s threat to not bail out insolvent banks is credible. Contrary to models without intervention or with government bailouts only, sparse networks enhance welfare for two main reasons: they improve the credibility of the regulator’s no-bailout threat for large shocks, and they reduce free-riding incentives among bail-in contributors when the threat is credible.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/719758

We develop a general framework that allows R&D to diffuse through both spillovers and voluntary technology transfers. To operationalize the framework, we create a data set of interactions in the market for technology between publicly held US firms. We use changes in tax incentives for R&D to identify causal effects. Taking market channels into account decreases the observed difference between social and private returns to R&D as compared with the canonical approach.

We use removal tendencies of child protection investigators as an instrument. Our analysis focuses on young children investigated before age 6 and finds that removal significantly increases test scores and reduces grade repetition for girls.

This pattern of results does not appear to be driven by heterogeneity in preremoval characteristics, foster placements, or types of schools attended after removal.

In Germany’s university admissions, the first stages of the Gale-Shapley algorithm are implemented in real time, allowing for multiple offers per student. We demonstrate that nonexploding early offers are accepted more often than later offers, despite not being more desirable. These results, together with survey evidence and a theoretical model, are consistent with students’ costly discovery of preferences. A novel dynamic multioffer mechanism that batches early offers improves matching efficiency by informing students of offer availability before preference discovery.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718983

To reconcile these three perspectives, we augment a standard dynamic firm model with organizational capital, an intangible, slow-moving, productive asset that can be produced only with the direct input of the firm’s leadership and that is subject to an agency problem.

We elicit individuals’ inflation expectations and then provide eight different forms of information regarding inflation. Reading the actual Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement has about the same average effect on expectations as simply being told about the Federal Reserve’s inflation target.

Comparing markets with and without signaling relative to the benchmark with no asymmetric information, we find that adverse selection destroys as much as 34% of total surplus, up to 78% of which can be restored with signaling.

As with the Shannon cost function, all can be solved using Lagrangian methods. Uniformly posterior-separable cost functions capture many forms of sequential learning and hence play a key role in many applications. Invariant posterior-separable cost functions make learning strategies depend exclusively on payoff uncertainty. We introduce two behavioral axioms, Locally Invariant Posteriors and Only Payoffs Matter, which identify posterior-separable functions as uniformly and invariant posterior separable, respectively.

We show that the same lack of commitment leads to other possible self-fulfilling crises, including issuance of more debt at depressed prices, or a “sudden stop” (forced austerity) in which debt issuance is sharply curtailed. Both outcomes stem from the government's incentive to eliminate uncertainty about imminent payments at the time of auction by altering the level of debt issuance. These outcomes generate a large increase in spread volatility in both a 1-period and a multiperiod quantitative debt model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718934

Journal of Political Economy,2022,"Trade, Structural Transformation, and Development: Evidence from Argentina 1869–1914",Pablo Fajgelbaum and Stephen Redding,"We provide new theory and evidence on the role of external and internal integration in structural transformation and economic development, using Argentina’s integration into the world economy in the late nineteenth century. Our theoretical model provides microfoundations for a spatial Balassa-Samuelson effect, in which locations closer to world markets have higher population densities, urban population shares, relative prices of nontraded goods, and land prices relative to wages, as well as specializing in traded goods that are transport-cost sensitive. We estimate the model’s parameters, provide evidence in support of this spatial Balassa-Samuelson mechanism, and find substantial effects of both external and internal integration on economic development.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718915
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Bidding and Drilling under Uncertainty: An Empirical Analysis of Contingent Payment Auctions,"Vivek Bhattacharya, Andrey Ordin and James W. Roberts","Auctions are often used to sell assets whose future cash flows require the winner to make postauction investments. When winners’ payments are contingent on these cash flows, auction design can influence both bidding and incentives to exert effort after the auction. We propose a model of contingent payment auctions that links auction design to postauction economic activity. In the context of oil leases in the Permian Basin, we show that moral hazard affects the relative revenue ranking of different auction designs. Among a large class of alternatives, the observed design cannot be changed to increase both revenues and drilling rates.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718916
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Detecting Large-Scale Collusion in Procurement Auctions,Kei Kawai and Jun Nakabayashi,"We document evidence of widespread collusion among construction firms in Japan using a novel data set covering most of the construction projects procured by the Japanese national government. Our data set contains information on about 42,000 auctions whose award amount sums to about $40 billion. We identify collusion by focusing on rebids that occur for auctions in which all (initial) bids fail to meet the secret reserve price. We identify more than 1,000 firms whose conduct is inconsistent with competitive behavior. These bidders were awarded about 15,000 projects, or about 37% of the total number of projects in our sample.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718913

Journal of Political Economy,2022,Cause and Effect in Political Polarization: A Dynamic Analysis,Steven Callander and Juan Carlos Carbajal,"Polarization is both a description of the current state of politics and a dynamic path that has rippled across the political domain over decades. We provide a simple model that explains why polarization appears incrementally and why it was elites who polarized first and more dramatically, whereas mass polarization came later and has been less pronounced. We incorporate an ostensibly unrelated finding about how voters form preferences into a dynamic model of elections. This change, when combined with the response of strategic candidates, creates a feedback loop that can replicate many features of the data. We explore the model’s implications for other aspects of politics and trace what it predicts for the future of polarization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718200
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Cost-Benefit Analysis in Reasoning,Larbi Alaoui and Antonio Penta,"An individual’s decision to reason about a problem may involve a trade-off between cognitive costs and a notion of value. This paper analyzes the primitive properties that must hold for the decision to stop thinking to be represented by a cost-benefit analysis. We then provide additional properties that give more structure to the value of reasoning function. We show how our model applies to a variety of settings, including contexts involving R&D applications, response time, and strategic reasoning. Our model can also be used to understand patterns of behavior for which the cost-benefit approach does not seem to hold.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718378
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Ordinal Centrality,Evan Sadler,"This paper studies the extent to which centrality measures share a common structure. In contrast with prior work, I take an ordinal approach, defining centrality measures as preorders that satisfy an axiom called recursive monotonicity. From this axiom, I derive two fundamental measures, strong and weak centrality, and I relate these to the equilibria of network games. Any equilibrium in a game of strategic complements implicitly orders the players by their actions. Strong centrality captures comparisons shared across all equilibria in all such games. Weak centrality captures comparisons shared across minimal and maximal equilibria in all such games.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718191

We suggest an additional measure, “completeness”: the fraction of the predictable variation in the data that the model captures. We calculate the completeness of prominent models in three problems from experimental economics: assigning certainty equivalents to lotteries, predicting initial play in games, and predicting human generation of random sequences. The completeness measure reveals new insights about these models, including how much room there is for improving their predictions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718371
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Good Reverberations? Teacher Influence in Music Composition since 1450,Karol Borowiecki,"Teachers and mentors in creative fields shape their students’ skills and views of the craft and thus the work they produce. How significant and persistent is this influence? Are there consequences for the variety and quality of students’ inventive output? We study these questions in the context of Western music composition over five centuries, during which musical lineages are well documented, the content of composers’ work can be directly compared, and its lasting value can be measured. We find strong evidence of influence, document when it arises and persists, and evaluate its consequences. The results provide insight into where creative ideas come from, why certain ideas get produced as opposed to others, and what the ramifications might be.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718370
Journal of Political Economy,2022,The Origin of the State: Land Productivity or Appropriability?,"Joram Mayshar, Omer Moav and Luigi Pascali","The conventional theory about the origin of the state is that the adoption of farming increased land productivity, which led to the production of food surplus. This surplus was a prerequisite for the emergence of tax-levying elites and, eventually, states. We challenge this theory and propose that hierarchy arose as a result of the shift to dependence on appropriable cereal grains. Our empirical investigation, utilizing multiple data sets spanning several millennia, demonstrates a causal effect of the cultivation of cereals on hierarchy, without finding a similar effect for land productivity. We further support our claims with several case studies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718372
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Welfare Reform and the Intergenerational Transmission of Dependence,"Robert Paul Hartley, Carlos Lamarche and James Ziliak","We investigate the effect of welfare reform on intergenerational welfare participation, using mother-daughter pairs in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find that a mother’s Aid to Families with Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (AFDC/TANF) participation increased her daughter’s odds of adult participation in that program by roughly 25 percentage points or more, but that welfare reform attenuated this transmission by at least 50%. However, there is no diminution of transmission after welfare reform when we consider the wider safety net or other outcomes. Daughters who grew up with mothers on AFDC/TANF were no better off after reform, with substitution toward other welfare programs over generations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717893
Journal of Political Economy,2022,"Monopoly Pricing, Optimal Randomization, and Resale",Simon Loertscher and Ellen V. Muir,"We provide a parsimonious and unified explanation for randomized selling mechanisms widely used in practice yet commonly perceived as puzzling. Optimality of randomization in the form of conflation and rationing implies that revenue under market-clearing pricing is nonconcave. Randomization is implementable via opaque pricing and underpricing. Relative to market-clearing pricing, randomization increases the equilibrium quantity and quality of goods sold and, consequently, may increase consumer surplus. For fixed quantities, resale increases consumer surplus. However, resale can decrease the equilibrium quantity and quality of goods sold. Thus, resale prohibition, which always benefits the seller, may also increase consumer surplus.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717894

Foster and Mark Rosenzweig,"We show that labor market transaction costs explain why the smallest farms are more efficient than slightly larger farms in most low-income countries and that increases in machine capacity with operational scale result in the globally observed rising upper tail of productivity. We find evidence consistent with these mechanisms using Indian data, and we show that if all Indian farms were at the minimum scale required to maximize the return on land, the number of farms would be reduced by 82% and income per farm worker would rise by 68%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717890

The method is a linear reframing of the 2013 nonlinear model of Dunbar, Lewbel, and Pendakur, extended to allow single-parent and other complex households, scale economies in assignable goods, and complementarities between nonassignable goods and supplemented with a linear identification test. We apply the model to data from 12 countries and investigate resource shares, gender gaps, and poverty at the individual level. We reject equal sharing and find large gender gaps in resource shares, and consequently in poverty rates, in some countries.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717892
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Why Does Education Reduce Crime?,"Brian Bell, Rui Costa and Stephen Machin","We provide a unifying empirical framework to study why crime reductions occurred due to a sequence of state-level dropout age reforms enacted between 1980 and 2010 in the United States. Because the reforms changed the shape of crime-age profiles, they generate both a short-term incapacitation effect and a more sustained crime-reducing effect. In contrast to previous research looking at earlier US education reforms, we find that reform-induced crime reduction does not arise primarily from education improvements. Decomposing short- and long-run effects, the observed longer-run effect for the post-1980 education reforms is primarily attributed to dynamic incapacitation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717895

The Effects of Salary Comparisons,Zoë Cullen and Ricardo Perez-Truglia,"The vast majority of the pay inequality in organizations comes from differences in pay between employees and their bosses. But are employees aware of these pay disparities? Are employees demotivated by this inequality? To address these questions, we conducted a natural field experiment with a sample of 2,060 employees from a multibillion-dollar corporation in Southeast Asia. We document large misperceptions among employees about the salaries of their managers and smaller but still significant misperceptions of the salaries of their peers, and we show that these perceptions have a significant causal effect on the employees’ own behavior.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717891

We detect government-sensitive topics and measure outlets’ news-reporting decisions from news article texts, and we estimate a structural model of demand for news, using detailed browsing data that traces individual-level consumption. The average consumer has a distaste for progovernment ideology but a strong, persistent taste for state-owned outlets, primarily driven by third-party referrals and nonsensitive news content.

I investigate the magnitude of these effects in New York City’s trade-waste market, where buyers can search either by themselves or through a waste broker. Combining elements from the empirical search and procurement auction literatures, I construct and estimate a model for a decentralized market. Results from the model show that intermediaries improve welfare and benefit buyers in both the broker and the search markets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717349

The seller makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the buyer. The cost of a signal is smooth and increasing in informativeness. We characterize the set of equilibria when learning is free and show that they are strongly Pareto ranked. Our main result is that when learning is costly but the cost of information goes to zero, equilibria converge to the worst free-learning equilibrium.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717350

This paper documents that aid disbursements to highly aid-dependent countries coincide with sharp increases in bank deposits in offshore financial centers known for bank secrecy and private wealth management but not in other financial centers. The estimates are not confounded by contemporaneous shocks—such as civil conflicts, natural disasters, and financial crises—and are robust to instrumenting using predetermined aid commitments. The implied leakage rate is around 7.5% at the sample mean and tends to increase with the ratio of aid to GDP. The findings are consistent with aid capture in the most aid-dependent countries.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717455

Participation is probabilistic, and bid prices are dispersed. The symmetric equilibrium is unique and yields simple analytic expressions. We use them to, for example, show that bid prices exhibit negative skewness. The expressions are further used to estimate the model based on bidding on a Standard & Poor’s 500 security. We find that the number of bidders declined over time, making liquidity supply fragile.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717454
Journal of Political Economy,2022,The Effects of Banking Competition on Growth and Financial Stability: Evidence from the National Banking Era,"Mark Carlson, Sergio Correia and Stephan Luck","How does banking competition affect credit provision and growth? How does it affect financial stability? In order to identify the causal effects of banking competition, we exploit a discontinuity in bank capital requirements during the nineteenth-century National Banking Era. We show that banks operating in markets with lower entry barriers extend more credit. The resulting credit expansion, in turn, is associated with additional real economic activity. However, banks in markets with lower entry barriers also take more risk and are more likely to default. Thus, we provide causal evidence that banking competition can cause both growth and financial instability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717453
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Management and Shocks to Worker Productivity,"Achyuta Adhvaryu, Namrata Kala and Anant Nyshadham","We study how managers mitigate the negative impacts of environmental shocks. Pairing productivity data from a garment firm with granular measures of air pollution, we show that productivity suffers as a result of pollution shocks but that managers respond by reallocating particularly sensitive workers to improve worker-to-task matches, thus mitigating team productivity losses. Responses are smaller for more inattentive managers; these same managers are also least able to mitigate productivity declines. These patterns are confirmed by leveraging variation in opportunities for reallocation and comparing how close managers of differing attentiveness can get to the simulated production frontier by reallocating workers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717046
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Cooperative Property Rights and Development: Evidence from Land Reform in El Salvador,Eduardo Montero,"In cooperative property rights systems, workers jointly own and manage production, whereas in outside-ownership systems, an owner contracts workers. Despite a rich literature on how the allocation of property rights matters for specialization, efficiency, and equity, little causal evidence exists. During a land reform in El Salvador in 1980, the military government reorganized properties owned by individuals with cumulative landholdings over 500 hectares into cooperatives; properties below this threshold remained as outside-owned properties. Using the discontinuous probability of cooperative formation, I provide evidence on the effects of cooperative property rights relative to outside ownership on specialization, productivity, and worker equity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717042
Journal of Political Economy,2022,Tolerance and Compromise in Social Networks,Garance Genicot,"Individuals typically differ in their identities—the behaviors they deem ideal for themselves and for the members of their network—and in their tolerance for behaviors that deviate from their ideals. This paper studies compromise—that is, departures from one’s ideal point, to be accepted by others. I show that an individual’s compromise in equilibrium is bounded by the difference between her tolerance level and the lowest tolerance level in society. Relatively intolerant individuals, who serve as “bridges,” are critical for reciprocated compromise. When individuals with extreme identities are systematically less tolerant, societies polarize. In contrast, intolerance among moderates encourages cohesion.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717041
Journal of Political Economy,2022,The Mortgage Rate Conundrum,"Alejandro Justiniano, Giorgio Primiceri and Andrea Tambalotti","We study the interest rates of privately securitized residential mortgages during the credit boom of the early 2000s. They reveal a sharp and persistent drop in the spread between mortgage and Treasury rates starting in the summer of 2003. The emergence of this mortgage rate conundrum immediately followed the collapse of an unprecedented refinancing wave, and it was more pronounced in the regions where that wave had grown faster. These same areas also experienced more originations of the nonconforming mortgages that boosted private label securitization after 2003. Mortgages originated after this shift are the first to show signs of deteriorating quality.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717043

However, rather than requiring entrepreneurs to learn everything, an alternative is to move beyond the boundary of the entrepreneur and link firms to these skills in a marketplace through insourcing workers or outsourcing tasks to professionals. We conducted a randomized experiment in Nigeria to test the relative effectiveness of these different approaches in improving business practices.

We study how rationing the commons shapes the efficiency and equity of resource use in the context of agricultural groundwater use in Rajasthan, India. We find that rationing binds on input use, such that farmers, despite trivial prices for water extraction, use roughly the socially optimal amount of water on average. The rationing regime is still grossly inefficient, because it misallocates water across farmers, lowering productivity. Pigouvian reform would increase agricultural surplus by 12% of household income yet fall well short of a Pareto improvement over rationing.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717045
