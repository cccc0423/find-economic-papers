Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Industry Wage Differentials: A Firm-Based Approach,"David Card, Jesse Rothstein and Moises Yi",We revisit the estimation of industry wage differentials using linked employer-employee data. Cross-sectional industry differences overstate pay premiums due to unmeasured heterogeneity. Estimates based on models with person and industry effects understate true premiums: workers who switch to a higher-premium industry typically move from higher-paying firms in their origin industry to lower-paying firms in their destination (and vice versa). The corrected standard deviation of log wage effects is 0.122 across narrowly defined industries and is similar at higher levels of aggregation. Higher-skilled workers sort to higher-pay industries. Premiums and worker sorting are more variable in cities with higher-wage firms and higher-skilled workers.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728803
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,"Household Mobility, Networks, and Gentrification of Minority Neighborhoods in the United States","Fernando Ferreira, Jeanna Kenney and Benjamin Smith","We investigate the impact of recent gentrification shocks on minority neighborhoods in the 50 largest US labor markets. We show that household moves from a given neighborhood are concentrated to few destinations with similar minority shares and strong network ties, but those neighborhoods are farther away from downtown. Gentrification affects Black neighborhoods by raising house prices, reducing the proportion of Black households, and increasing the share of movers going to neighborhoods with network ties. However, gentrification has negligible effects on Hispanic neighborhoods. Overall labor market area segregation decreases after a gentrification shock because highly Black neighborhoods become less segregated.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728805
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Teacher Salaries and Racial Inequality in Educational Attainment in the Midcentury South,Elizabeth Cascio and Ethan G. Lewis,"In the late 1930s, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) launched a campaign to equalize Black and white teacher salaries in the de jure segregated schools of the American South. We estimate the effect of teacher pay on educational attainment exploiting variation in Black salary gains over time across Southern counties with different Black enrollment shares and across states by whether subsequent policy reinforced or resisted court rulings favorable to the NAACP. Using newly collected county panel data, we find that Black teacher salary gains contributed to the large reductions in racial inequality in school enrollment and grade progression in the South at midcentury.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728470
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,"Skill, Productivity, and Wages: Direct Evidence from a Temporary Help Agency","Xinwei Dong, Dean Hyslop and Daiji Kawaguchi","Firms frequently provide general skill training for workers. Theories propose that labor market frictions entail wage compression, generate larger productivity gains than wage growth to skill acquisition, and motivate a firm to offer general skill training, but few studies directly test them. We use unusually rich data from a temporary help service firm that records both workers’ wages and their productivity as measured by the fees charged to client firms. We find that skill acquired through training and learning by doing increases productivity more than wages, with such wage compression accounting for half of the average 40% productivity growth over 5 years of tenure.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728809
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Caregiving and Labor Supply: New Evidence from Administrative Data,"Nicole Maestas, Matt Messel and Yulya Truskinovsky","A significant share of the rapidly growing demand for long-term care is met by family members, many of whom also work, and family caregiving has been shown to affect labor market outcomes. We use survey responses about family caregiving roles linked to administrative earnings records to estimate the employment trajectories of family caregivers over a 25-year period around the reported start of a caregiving episode. These trajectories vary significantly by gender. Relative to a matched comparison group, caregiving precipitates a drop in both earnings and employment for women, while men enter caregiving only after experiencing significant labor supply disruptions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728810
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,"Geographic Variation in Cesarean Sections in the United States: Trends, Correlates, and Other Interesting Facts","Sarah Robinson, Heather Royer and David Silver","Analyzing data spanning three decades covering the near universe of births, we study county-level differences in C-section rates among first-time mothers of singleton births. Our research reveals persistent geographic variation in C-section rates for both low- and high-risk groups. Counties with elevated C-section rates consistently perform more C-sections across mothers at all levels of appropriateness for the procedure. These elevated rates of C-section in counties with high C-section rates are associated with reduced maternal and infant morbidity. We also find that C-section decisions are less responsive to underlying risks for Black mothers relative to white mothers, suggesting potential welfare-reducing disparities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728804
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Value of Student Debt Relief and the Role of Administrative Barriers: Evidence from the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program,"Brian A. Jacob, Damon Jones and Benjamin J. Keys","We explore how much borrowers value student debt relief in the setting of the federal Teacher Loan Forgiveness program, which cancels between $5,000 and $17,500 in debt for teachers at high-need schools. Using both quasi-experimental evidence and a randomized controlled trial, we find that neither eligibility nor a targeted information intervention affects employment decisions. Information was found to increase application and receipt rates for teachers who had achieved eligibility. Evidence from contingent valuation surveys suggests that teachers do in general value debt relief. Incorporating qualitative evidence, we conclude that take-up may be constrained by program complexity and administrative barriers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728468
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Employment and Distributional Impacts of Nationwide Minimum Wage Changes,"Giulia Giupponi, Robert Joyce, Attila Lindner, Tom Waters, Thomas Wernham and Xiaowei Xu","We assess the impact of nationwide minimum wages on employment throughout the whole wage distribution by exploiting geographical variation in the level of wages. We find a substantial increase in wages at the bottom of the wage distribution, while we detect a small, statistically insignificant negative effect on employment. Combining the estimated change in the wage distribution with a tax and benefit microsimulation model, we show that the minimum wage generates considerable proportional income gains up to the middle of the household income distribution.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728471
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Comparing the Effects of Policies for the Labor Market Integration of Refugees,"Mette Foged, Linea Hasager and Giovanni Peri","This paper reviews, reanalyzes, and extends to the long run the estimated effects of integration polices on the employment probability and earnings of refugees in Denmark. We first describe the dynamics of labor market outcomes of refugees in Denmark. We then find that increased language training and initial placement in strong labor markets improved refugees’ long-run labor market outcomes, while cutting initial welfare payments and placing refugees near other refugees did not improve them. Policies focused on matching refugees with occupations experiencing shortages have positive short-run effects, but we cannot yet assess their long-run effects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728806
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Unemployment Insurance (UI) Benefit Generosity and Labor Supply from 2002 to 2020: Evidence from California UI Records,"Alex Bell, T. J. Hedin, Geoffrey Schnorr and Till  von Wachter","This paper obtains comparable estimates of the effect of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits on labor supply throughout the unemployment spell and over the business cycle using a regression kink design and 20 years of administrative data from California. For a given unemployment duration, the behavioral effect of UI benefit levels on labor supply does not vary with the business cycle from 2002 to 2019. However, due to increased coverage from extensions in benefit durations, the duration elasticity of UI benefits rises during recessions. The behavioral effect during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic is substantially lower at all unemployment durations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728808
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Expanding Landscape of Online Education: Who Engages and How They Fare,"Lisa Barrow, Wesley T. Morris and Lauren Sartain","Online university courses have become common, though some question whether the modality can adequately substitute for an in-person experience. We explore online course enrollment and student outcomes at a large public 4-year system. Online enrollment nearly doubled from 2012 to 2019. Female students and older students were especially likely to take online classes. Students earned more As and Fs in online courses, but semester grade point averages were higher in terms when students took at least one class online. Importantly, taking higher shares of courses online was associated with increased degree completion, with the largest benefits for younger students and male students.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728807
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Efficacy of Tournaments for Nonroutine Team Tasks,"Florian Englmaier, Stefan Grimm, Dominik Grothe, David Schindler and Simeon Schudy","Tournaments are often used to improve performance in innovation contexts. Tournaments provide monetary incentives but also render teams’ identity and image concerns salient. We study the effects of tournaments on team performance in a nonroutine task and identify the importance of these behavioral aspects. In a field experiment (n>1,700 participants), we vary the salience of team identity, social image concerns, and whether teams face monetary incentives. Increased salience of team identity does not improve performance. Social image motivates the top performers. Additional monetary incentives improve all teams’ outcomes without crowding out teams’ willingness to explore or perform similar tasks again.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725553
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Measuring Labor Market Power in Developing Countries: Evidence from Colombian Plants,Francesco Amodio and Nicolás de Roux,"How much can employers in low- and middle-income countries suppress wages below marginal productivity? Using plant and customs data from Colombia, we exploit predetermined variation across plants in sales export destinations combined with variation in exchange rates to generate plant-specific shocks to marginal revenue productivity and labor demand. We estimate a firm-level labor supply elasticity of around 2.5, implying that workers produce about 40% more than their wage level. This result is driven by plants that account for a large share of local employment, consistent with an oligopsonistic labor market model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725248
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Geography of Job Tasks,"Enghin Atalay, Sebastian Sotelo and Daniel Tannenbaum","We introduce new measurement tools to understand the sources of earnings differences across space. Based on the natural language employers use in job ads, we develop granular measures of job tasks and of worker specialization. We find that jobs in larger commuting zones involve greater interpersonal interactions and have higher computer software requirements. Between 10% and 50% of task and technology variation between large and small commuting zones exists within occupations. Furthermore, workers in larger markets are more specialized. Tasks, technologies, and worker specialization account for a substantial portion of the market size premium even within occupations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725360
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Do Less Informative College Admission Exams Reduce Earnings Inequality? Evidence from Colombia,Evan Riehl,"This paper asks whether reducing the informativeness of college admission exams reduces inequality in postcollege earnings. I examine a 2000 reform of the Colombian college admission exam that sought to reduce bias in scores. The reform reduced test score gaps between high- and low-income students by nearly 50% in some subjects, but it also decreased the exam’s predictive power for abilities that matter in college. I find that the reform caused students to attend colleges where they were more likely to drop out, which reduced earnings for both high- and low-income students.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725167
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Altruism or Money? Reducing Teacher Sorting Using Behavioral Strategies in Peru,"Nicolás Ajzenman, Eleonora Bertoni, Gregory Elacqua, Luana Marotta and Carolina Méndez Vargas","Inequality in access to high-quality teachers is an important driver of socioeconomic student achievement gaps. We experimentally evaluate a novel nationwide low-cost government program that deployed two behavioral strategies to motivate teachers to apply to job vacancies in disadvantaged schools. These strategies consisted of an “altruistic identity” treatment, which primed teachers’ altruistic identity by making it more salient, and an “extrinsic incentives” treatment, which simplified the presentation and increased the salience of an existing government monetary incentive scheme that rewards teachers who work in underprivileged institutions. Both strategies successfully encouraged teaching candidates to apply to disadvantaged schools.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725166
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Impact of Selection into the Labor Force on the Gender Wage Gap,"Francine D. Blau, Lawrence Kahn, Nikolai Boboshko and Matthew Comey","Using Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics data, we study selection bias and the gender wage gap. Employing several methods, we find large declines in the total and unexplained gender gaps in wage offers between 1981 and 2015. Under our preferred selection correction method, the median total and unexplained gaps fell by 0.378 and 0.204 log points, respectively. These are larger declines than if we had not corrected for selection and simply measured convergence in observed wage gaps. However, substantial selectivity-corrected median gender wage gaps remain in 2015: 0.242 log points (total gap) and 0.206 log points (unexplained gap).",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725032
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Is Parental Leave Costly for Firms and Coworkers?,"Anne Ardila Brenøe, Serena Canaan, Nikolaj A. Harmon and Heather N. Royer","We estimate the effect of a female employee giving birth and taking parental leave on small firms and coworkers in Denmark using a dynamic difference-in-differences design. We find little evidence that parental leave take-up has negative effects on firms and coworkers overall. This is because most firms are very effective in compensating for the worker on leave by hiring temporary workers and by increasing other employees’ hours. In contrast, we do find evidence that parental leave has negative effects on a small subsample of firms that are less able to use their existing employees to compensate for absent workers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725554
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Unemployed Job Search across People and over Time: Evidence from Applied-For Jobs,"Jonas Fluchtmann, Anita M. Glenny, Nikolaj Harmon and Jonas Maibom","Using data on applied-for jobs for the universe of Danish unemployment insurance recipients, we examine variation in job search behavior both across individuals and over time during unemployment spells. We find large differences in the level of applied-for wages across individuals, but over time all individuals adjust wages downward in the same way. The decline in applied-for wages over time is descriptively small but economically important in standard models of job search. We find similar results when examining variation in the nonwage characteristics of applied-for jobs and in the search methods used to find them. We discuss implications for theory.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725165
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Effect of Job Search Requirements on Family Welfare Receipt,"Marc Chan, Nicolas Hérault, Ha Vu and Roger Wilkins","Many countries impose job search requirements on unemployment benefit recipients. Existing studies have mainly focused on the impact of incremental changes to requirements on the recipients. Australian reforms in 1995 saw groups of partnered welfare recipients newly subjected to job search requirements, allowing us to produce causal estimates of the effects on family welfare receipt of introducing such requirements. Using a quasi-experimental design and administrative data, we find large negative effects on welfare receipt for the mature-age partnered women targeted by the reforms and similar effects on welfare receipt of their partners, suggesting that family labor supply decisions were considerably affected.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724157
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Grades and Employer Learning,"Anne Toft Hansen, Ulrik Hvidman and Hans Henrik Sievertsen","We identify the labor market returns to university grade point average (GPA) by leveraging a nationwide change in the scaling of grades in Danish universities. Our results show that a reform-induced increase in GPA that is unrelated to ability causes higher earnings immediately after graduation, but the effect fades in subsequent years. The effect at labor market entry is largest for individuals with fewer alternative signals. Although employers initially screen candidates on the basis of skill signals, our findings are consistent with a model in which employers rapidly learn about worker productivity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724048
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Decline in Rent Sharing,"Brian Bell, Paweł Bukowski and Stephen Machin","The evolution of rent sharing is studied. Based on a panel of the top 300 publicly quoted British companies over 35 years and using excess stock market returns to patenting activity as an instrument for economic rents, the paper reports evidence of a significant fall over time in the pass-through from rents to wages. It confirms that wages do respond to firm-level shocks to economic rents, but by significantly less after 2000 than during the 1980s and 1990s. The evidence of decline is robust, corroborated with alternative instruments and industry-level analysis for the United States and the European Union.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724570
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Who Benefits from Attending Effective High Schools?,"C. Kirabo Jackson, Sebastián Kiguel, Shanette C. Porter and John Q. Easton","We estimate the longer-run effects of attending an effective high school (one that improves a combination of test scores, survey measures of socioemotional development, and behaviors in ninth grade) for students who are more versus less educationally advantaged. All students benefit from attending effective schools, but the least advantaged students experience larger improvements in high school graduation, college going, and school-based arrests. Test score value-added understates the long-run importance of effective schools, particularly for less advantaged populations. Patterns suggest that this may, in part, reflect less advantaged students being relatively more responsive to non-test-score dimensions of school quality.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724568
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,"School Performance, Score Inflation, and Neighborhood Development",Erich Battistin and Lorenzo Neri,"We show that score inflation yields residential sorting around what households expect to be better schools, with long-term consequences for the economic geography of neighborhoods. We consider primary school exams in England, where grading standards have triggered an inflation of indicators in the national performance tables since the mid-1990s. Local neighborhoods were gentrified because of school improvements artificially signaled by score inflation. Competition between schools increased, yielding a real improvement in their quality. Effects of score inflation on house prices, deprivation, and local economic activities are identifiable through to the present day.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725001
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Speed of Earnings Responses to Taxation and the Role of Firm Labor Demand,Matthew Gudgeon and Simon Trenkle,"This paper studies the speed at which workers’ pretax earnings respond to tax changes along the intensive margin. We do so in the context of Germany, where a large notch in the tax schedule induces sharp bunching in the earnings distribution. We analyze earnings responses to two policy reforms that shift this notch outward and find clear evidence that frictions delay the earnings responses of more than 38% of workers. We propose that heterogeneity in firm labor demand plays a key role in generating the observed differences in the speed of workers’ earnings responses and provide supporting evidence.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723831
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,"Industry Mix, Local Labor Markets, and the Incidence of Trade Shocks","Moises Yi, Steffen Mueller and Jens Stegmaier","We analyze how skill transferability and the local industry mix affect the adjustment costs of workers hit by a trade shock. Using German administrative data and novel measures of economic distance, we construct an index of labor market absorptiveness that captures the degree to which workers from a particular industry are able to reallocate into other jobs. Among manufacturing workers, we find that the earnings loss associated with increased import exposure is much higher for those who live in the least absorptive regions. We conclude that the local industry composition plays an important role in the adjustment processes of workers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724569
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Cohort Size and the Marriage Market: Explaining Nearly a Century of Changes in US Marriage Rates,Mary Ann Bronson and Maurizio Mazzocco,"We document that the US marriage market is characterized by two systematic empirical patterns. First, there is a quantitatively large, strong, and persistent negative relationship between changes in cohort size and marriage rates of women. Second, the same negative correlation holds for men. We then establish the features a model should possess to generate these patterns. A standard matching model with search frictions is rejected by the data because it produces a negative relationship for women but a positive relationship for men. We generalize the standard model to show under what conditions it rationalizes both patterns.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724047
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic Recession on Less Educated Women’s Human Capital: Some Projections,"Mark Drozd, Robert A. Moffitt and Xinyu Zhao","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major declines in employment of women. We provide projections of impacts of this reduction on less educated women’s future human capital framed within the traditional Mincerian model. We find that wage losses one year out from 2020 are relatively modest on average, generally less than 1%, with the largest for married women without children in the home. But losses are greater for young married women, mothers with very young children, and those working in COVID-impacted industries. School and childcare closures increase negative wage impacts for married mothers by an additional 50%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728431
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,What Firms Do: Gender Inequality in Linked Employer-Employee Data,Alessandra Casarico and Salvatore Lattanzio,"We study the extent to which employer heterogeneity affects gender gaps in earnings across the distribution, over time, and over the life cycle, accounting for cohort effects. Using a linked employer-employee dataset for Italy, we show that the gender gap in firm pay premia explains 34% of the mean gender pay gap, mainly due to between-firm components. Within-firm differences are more important at the top of the distribution and have become more relevant over time. Gender differences in mobility toward firms with higher pay premia and within-firm gender inequality partly explain the gender gap in firm pay premia.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723177
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Long-Run Spillover Effects of Pollution: How Exposure to Lead Affects Everyone in the Classroom,"Ludovica Gazze, Claudia Persico and Sandra Spirovska","Children exposed to pollutants like lead have lower academic achievement and are more likely to engage in risky behavior. However, little is known about whether lead-exposed children affect the long-run outcomes of their peers. We estimate these spillover effects using unique data on preschool blood lead levels (BLLs) matched to education data for all students in North Carolina public schools. We compare siblings whose school-grade cohorts differ in the proportion of children with elevated BLLs, holding constant school and peers’ demographics. Having more lead-exposed peers is associated with lower high school graduation and SAT-taking rates and increased suspensions and absences.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723175
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Pricing the Biological Clock: The Marriage Market Costs of Aging to Women,Corinne Low,"This paper quantifies the causal negative impact of age on women’s marriage market appeal using an experiment where real online daters rate hypothetical profiles with randomly assigned ages. Truthfulness is incentivized through the experiment’s compensation: participants receive professional dating advice customized according to their ratings. The experiment shows that for every year a woman ages, she must earn $7,000 more annually to remain equally attractive to potential partners. This preference appears driven by women’s asymmetric fertility decline with age, as it is present only for men without children and who have accurate knowledge of the age-fertility trade-off.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723834
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,"Welfare versus Work under a Negative Income Tax: Evidence from the Gary, Seattle, Denver, and Manitoba Income Maintenance Experiments",Chris Riddell and W. Craig Riddell,"The income maintenance experiments have received renewed attention due to growing international interest in a basic income. Proponents of a negative income tax (NIT) viewed it as a replacement for traditional welfare with stronger work incentives. However, existing labor supply estimates for single mothers (those eligible for welfare) are uniformly negative. We reassess the experimental evidence and find randomization failure in two NITs (Gary and Seattle). In Denver and Manitoba, we find positive labor supply responses for those on welfare before random assignment. Our results provide strong evidence that an NIT can increase work activity among single mothers on welfare.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723706
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Entrepreneurial Spillovers from Corporate R&D,Tania Babina and Sabrina T. Howell,"This paper offers the first study of how changes in corporate R&D investment affect labor mobility. We show that increases in R&D spur employee departures to join start-ups’ founding teams. This appears to reflect employees taking the ideas, skills, or technologies created through the R&D process but not especially valuable to the R&D-investing firm to start-ups. The employee-founded start-ups tend to be outside the R&D-investing employer’s industry, suggesting that the underlying ideas would impose diversification costs on the R&D-investing firm. The start-ups are more likely to be VC backed, high tech, and high wage, pointing to substantial spillover benefits.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723501
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Labor Supply within the Firm,"Michele Battisti, Ryan Michaels and Choonsung Park","There is substantial variation in working time even within employer-employee matches, yet estimates of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply can be near zero. This paper proposes a tractable theory of earnings and working time to interpret these observations. Production complementarities attenuate the response of working time to idiosyncratic, or worker-specific, shocks, but firm-wide shocks are mediated by preference parameters. The model can be identified using firm-worker matched data, revealing a Frisch elasticity of around 0.5. A quasi-experimental approach that exploits only idiosyncratic variation would find an elasticity less than half this.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723519
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Career Consequences of Firm Heterogeneity for Young Workers: First Job and Firm Size,Jaime Arellano-Bover,"I study the long-term effects of landing a first job at a large firm versus a small one using Spanish administrative data. Size could be a relevant employer attribute for inexperienced workers since large firms are associated with greater productivity, wages, and training. The key empirical challenge is selection into first jobs based on unobserved worker characteristics. I develop an instrumental variable approach that, keeping business cycle conditions fixed, leverages variation in the composition of labor demand that labor market entrants face. Initially matching with a larger firm persistently improves long-term outcomes, even through subsequent jobs. Mechanisms suggest better skill development at large firms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723500
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,"Robots and Employment: Evidence from Japan, 1978–2017","Daisuke Adachi, Daiji Kawaguchi and Yukiko Saito","This paper studies the relationship between industrial robots and employment in Japan on the basis of a unique dataset that allows us to calculate the unit price of robots. Our model combines standard factor demand theory with a recent task-based approach to derive a simple estimation equation between robot prices and employment, and our identification strategy leverages heterogeneous applications of robots across industries and heterogeneous price changes across applications. We find that the decline in robot prices increased both the number of robots and employment by raising the productivity and production scale of robot-adopting industries.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/723205
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Black-White Recognition Gap in Award Nominations,"Nayoung Rim, Roman Rivera, Andrea Kiss and Bocar Ba","There is evidence showing racial bias in firms’ hiring decisions, but less is known about bias in career recognition. We construct a dataset from the second-largest US police department to estimate the Black-white gap in award nominations. Leveraging institutional features, we find that white supervisors are less likely to nominate Black officers conditional on work performance. This appears to be driven by supervisor bias in advocacy decisions rather than statistical discrimination. Given the reliance on subjective evaluations for promotions in many organizations, our findings have important implications for the Black-white promotion gap and the lack of diversity in upper-management positions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722412
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,Economic Outcomes of Strikers in an Era of Weak Unions,Maxim Massenkoff and Nathan Wilmers,"From 1970 to 2000, worker participation in strikes decreased by 90%. We show that strikers also experienced worse outcomes after 1981. Evidence from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics suggests that strikers enjoyed 5%–10% wage gains before the 1980s but null wage changes thereafter. Additional analyses of other survey data and collective bargaining agreements reinforce the finding that strikes since the 1980s have not been associated with increases in wages, hours, or benefits. We attribute these findings to structural labor market shifts and to a narrower deterioration in labor relations signaled by the 1981 air traffic controllers strike.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722743
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,What Do Course Offerings Imply about University Preferences?,James Thomas,"This paper empirically analyzes how universities decide which courses to offer and the implications of these decisions for students. At a sample university, course offerings significantly impact student course choices and implicitly sacrifice student utility to increase enrollment in STEM and business and occupational courses. This is because new course sections in these fields have slightly smaller effects on student utility and cost substantially more than new offerings in other fields. The university changes its course offerings in counterfactual scenarios, and ignoring these responses leads to understating the effects of interventions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722087
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,"Firm Productivity, Wages, and Sorting",Benjamin Lochner and Bastian Schulz,"We study the link between firm productivity and the wages that firms pay. Guided by a search-matching model with large firms, worker and firm heterogeneity, and production complementarities, we infer firm productivity by estimating firm-level production functions. Using German data, we find that the most productive firms do not pay the highest wages. Worker transitions from high- to medium-productivity firms are on average associated with wage gains. Productivity sorting—that is, the sorting of high-ability workers into high-productivity firms—is less pronounced than the sorting into high-wage firms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722564
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Effect of Labor Market Shocks across the Life Cycle,"Kjell G Salvanes, Barton Willage and Alexander Willén","Economic shocks occur frequently and may cause individuals to reevaluate key life decisions in ways that have lasting consequences for themselves and the broader economy. These decisions are tied to life stages, and the effect of economic shocks may differ depending on when they occur. We exploit exogenous job separations to study the impact of adverse shocks across the life cycle on labor market outcomes and major life decisions: education, mobility, family structure, and retirement. We find significant heterogeneity across the life cycle and conclude that focusing on average effects among workers across the life cycle misses a great deal.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722086
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Local Labor Market Effect of Relaxing Internal Migration Restrictions: Evidence from China,"Lei An, Yu Qin, Jing Wu and Wei You","We study how a significant relaxation of internal migration restrictions affects labor market outcomes of incumbent migrants and natives, exploiting the 2014 hukou reform in China, which substantially removed the migration barriers of cities with an urban population below 5 million (nonmegacities). Using a difference-in-differences method, we find that migrants’ wages in nonmegacities experienced approximately a 2.6%–7.9% decline relative to that in megacities after the policy. The policy had nonnegative impacts on the wages of natives in nonmegacities. These results suggest that the downward wage pressure imposed by new migrants falls primarily on incumbent migrants rather than on natives.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722620
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,"Occupation Growth, Skill Prices, and Wage Inequality","Michael J. Böhm, Hans-Martin von Gaudecker and Felix Schran","We study the relationship among occupational employment, occupational wages, and wage inequality. In all occupations, entrants and leavers earn less than stayers, suggesting negative selection effects for growing occupations and positive effects for shrinking ones. We estimate a model of occupational prices and skills that includes specific skill accumulation and endogenous switching. Contrary to uncorrected wages, prices and employment growth are positively related. Forty percent of selection is due to age, as entrants and leavers have had less time to accumulate skills. The remainder is Roy-type selection. Skill prices establish a quantitative connection of occupational changes with surging wage inequality.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722084
Journal of Labor Economics,2024,The Effect of Changes in the Skill Premium on College Degree Attainment and the Choice of Major,"Ran Abramitzky, Victor Lavy and Maayan Segev","We study the impact of financial incentives on higher education decisions and the choice of major. We rely on a reform whereby Israeli kibbutzim shifted from their traditional policy of equal sharing to productivity-based wages, using for identification the staggered implementation of this reform. In this setting of very low initial returns to education, we find that the dramatic increase in the rate of return and its sharp variation across fields of study led to a large increase in the probability of receiving a bachelor’s degree, especially in STEM fields of study that are expected to yield higher financial returns.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722565
