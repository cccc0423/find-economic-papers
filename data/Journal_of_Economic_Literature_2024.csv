Journal of Economic Literature,2024,Social Protection in the Developing World,"Abhijit Banerjee, Rema Hanna, Benjamin A. Olken and Diana Sverdlin Lisker","Social protection programs have become increasingly widespread in low- and middle-income countries, with their own distinct characteristics to match the environments in which they are operating. This paper reviews the growing literature on the design and impact of these programs. We review how to identify potential beneficiaries given the large informal sector, the design and implementation of redistribution and income support programs, and the challenges and potential of social insurance. We use our frameworks as a guide for consolidating and organizing the existing literature and also to highlight areas and questions for future research.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241646
Journal of Economic Literature,2024,The Economics of Social Media,"Guy Aridor, Rafael Jiménez-Durán, Ro'ee Levy and Lena Song","We provide a guide to the burgeoning literature on the economics of social media. We first define social media platforms and highlight their unique features. We then synthesize the main lessons from the empirical economics literature and organize them around the three stages of the life cycle of content: (i) production, (ii) distribution, and (iii) consumption. Under production, we discuss how incentives affect content produced on and off social media and how harmful content is moderated. Under distribution, we discuss the social network structure, algorithms, and targeted advertisements. Under consumption, we discuss how social media affects individuals who consume its content and society at large, and explore consumer substitution patterns across platforms. Throughout the guide, we examine case studies on the deterrence of misinformation, segregation, political advertisements, and the effects of social media on political outcomes. We conclude with a brief discussion of the future of social media.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241743
Journal of Economic Literature,2024,The Origins of Enduring Economic Inequality,Samuel Bowles and Mattia Fochesato,"We survey archaeological evidence suggesting that among hunter-gatherers and farmers in Neolithic western Eurasia (11,700 to 5,300 years ago) elevated levels of wealth inequality occurred but were ephemeral and rare compared to the substantial enduring inequalities of the past five millennia. In response, we seek to understand not the de novo ""creation of inequality"" but instead the processes by which substantial wealth differences could persist over long periods and why this occurred only at the end of the Neolithic, at least four millennia after the agricultural revolution. Archaeological and anthropological evidence suggests that a culture of aggressive egalitarianism may have thwarted the emergence of enduring wealth inequality until the Late Neolithic, when new farming technologies raised the value of material wealth relative to labor and a concentration of elite power in early proto-states (and eventually the exploitation of enslaved labor) provided the political and economic conditions for heightened wealth inequalities to endure.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241718
Journal of Economic Literature,2024,The Changing Identities of American Wives and Mothers,"Jeanne Lafortune, Laura Salisbury and Aloysius Siow","Over the last century, resource allocations within families changed significantly, as did marriage matching patterns. College-educated women became more likely to marry (and, to a lesser extent, have children) than less educated women. A large literature documents these patterns and proposes a variety of explanations. We review this literature. Then, we provide a unified empirical framework, which can integrate these mechanisms. We demonstrate the usefulness of that framework by employing it in decennial US censuses and showing that a combination of technological changes that increased the value of children's education and enabled more educated women to devote more time to child-rearing are consistent with multiple behavioral changes within marriage, on the marriage market, and before marriage.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20231648
Journal of Economic Literature,2024,Should They Compete or Should They Cooperate? The View of Agency Theory,"Pierre Fleckinger, David Martimort and Nicolas Roux","What is the most efficient way of designing incentives in an organization? Over the past five decades, agency theory has provided various answers to this crucial question. This line of research suggests that, depending on the organizational context, the optimal approach to providing incentives may involve either relying on collective compensations or, conversely, employing relative performance evaluations. In the first scenario, cooperation among agents is the key aspect of the organization. In the second, competition prevails. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of this extensive literature with the aim of understanding the conditions under which one or the other type of incentive schemes is more desirable for the principal of the organization. To this end, we use a flexible and versatile model capable of addressing a wide range of scenarios characterized by different technologies, information constraints, and behavioral norms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241678
Journal of Economic Literature,2024,Soviet Mathematics and Economic Theory in the Past Century: A Historical Reappraisal,Ivan Boldyrev,"What are the effects of authoritarian regimes on scholarly research in economics? And how might economic theory survive ideological pressures? This article addresses these questions by focusing on the mathematization of economics over the past century and drawing on the history of Soviet science. Mathematics in the USSR remained internationally competitive and generated many ideas that were taken up and played important roles in economic theory. These same ideas, however, were disregarded or adopted only in piecemeal fashion by Soviet economists, despite the efforts of influential scholars to change the economic research agenda. The article draws this contrast into sharper focus by exploring the work of Soviet mathematicians in optimization, game theory, and probability theory that was used in Western economics. While the intellectual exchange across the Iron Curtain did help advance the formal modeling apparatus, economics could only thrive in an intellectually open environment absent under Soviet rule.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241699
Journal of Economic Literature,2024,Can Massive Technological Progress Hurt Workers? A Review of Power and Progress by Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson,Fiona Scott Morton,"This book offers a radical thesis: Technological innovation often benefits elites while worsening conditions for workers, challenging the common view that technology always improves living standards. Through historical transitions like the Industrial Revolution, the authors illustrate how innovations have frequently led to worker exploitation. They argue that governance, rather than competition, determines whether technological advances benefit society. In the digital age, platforms exploit user data without fair compensation, causing harm through addictive services and poor regulation. The book calls for stronger regulations to protect consumers and ensure that innovation aligns with societal well-being, especially as artificial intelligence spreads.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20241761

Journal of Economic Literature,2024,New Advances on an Old Question: Does Money Matter for Children's Outcomes?,Marianne Page,"Family income is a positive predictor of children's health, human capital, and later-life earnings, but determining the extent to which these associations reflect causal effects is challenging. A recent wave of natural and randomized experiments, together with increased accessibility of large-scale administrative data, are allowing us to gain new perspectives about the importance of families' monetary resources in the United States and other high-income countries. This review pulls the emerging literature together to provide deeper insights into what we know, and what we don't know, about the extent to which policies that provide more generous income transfers could make a difference to children's life chances. My reading of the evidence suggests that policies providing financial resources to economically vulnerable families have the potential to improve children's outcomes. The magnitude of predicted impacts varies considerably across studies, however, and may be related to specific features of the income-generating event that researchers' leverage.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20231553

Journal of Economic Literature,2024,Religion and Growth,"Sascha Becker, Jared Rubin and Ludger Woessmann","We use the elements of a macroeconomic production function—physical capital, human capital, labor, and technology—together with standard growth models to frame the role of religion in economic growth. Unifying a growing literature, we argue that religion can enhance or impinge upon economic growth through all four elements because it shapes individual preferences, societal norms, and institutions. Religion affects physical capital accumulation by influencing thrift and financial development. It affects human capital through both religious and secular education. It affects population and labor by influencing work effort, fertility, and the demographic transition. And it affects total factor productivity by constraining or unleashing technological change and through rituals, legal institutions, political economy, and conflict. Synthesizing a disjoint literature in this way opens many interesting directions for future research.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20231666

Revisions of workhorse models used so far to analyze temporary employment are also suggested.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20231655
Journal of Economic Literature,2024,A Journey into Harold Hotelling's Economics,"Marion Gaspard, Antoine Missemer and Thomas Mueller","Harold Hotelling (1895–1973) was a major contributor to twentieth-century American economics. The overall thrust of his research, and his view of the role of mathematics in the discipline, have so far received little attention. Based on an unprecedented examination of his work and professional archives, this article provides a thorough analysis of Hotelling's background and contribution to economics. A self-taught economist in the 1920s, Hotelling built a research program that, despite apparently being highly technical, was primarily conceived as applied science to solve concrete social and economic issues, from spatial competition to natural resource exhaustion and public utility regulation. Although Hotelling's research was not exempt from criticism, it remains profoundly inspiring for the twenty-first century, from both a theoretical and epistemological point of view. When we remember that he trained the greatest, from Kenneth J. Arrow to William Vickrey, his career and ideas are all the more worthy of consideration.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20231700

A Review of Economic Prehistory by Dow and Reed,Samuel Bowles and Amy Bogaard,"In a work of extraordinary scope and scholarship, Gregory K. Dow and Clyde G. Reed deploy conventional microeconomic theory to explain ""six transitions that shaped the world,"" namely, the transitions to sedentism, farming, inequality, war, cities, and states. The models they offer provide a level of clarity about potential causal mechanisms that is unusual in the archaeological literature. But we are not convinced by some of their key empirical claims in light of current archaeological evidence, and we think that contemporary economics—including evolutionary game theory—has more appropriate models to offer than the Marshallian approach taken by the authors.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20221713

Rehabilitating the forgotten analyses of contemporary political philosophers Quinet, de Sade, and Leroux, I defend the view that a correct understanding of the French Revolution's essence lies in its political philosophical dimension, not in the supposed psychological traits of its actors.

Journal of Economic Literature,2024,Central Bank Communication with the General Public: Promise or False Hope?,"Alan Blinder, Michael Ehrmann, Jakob de Haan and David-Jan Jansen","Central banks are increasingly reaching out to the general public to motivate and explain their monetary policy actions. One major aim of this outreach is to ensure accountability and create trust; another is to guide inflation expectations. This article surveys a rapidly growing literature on central bank communication with the public, rather than with the financial markets. We first discuss why such communication matters and is more challenging than communicating with expert audiences. Then we turn to methods: How do central banks try to reach the public, and do they succeed? Next, and importantly, we survey the empirical evidence on the extent to which this new outreach affects inflation expectations. On balance, we see some promise in the potential to inform the public better, but many challenges along the way.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20231683

We conduct a large-scale, interdisciplinary meta-analysis to systematically accumulate knowledge from numerous empirical estimates of the loss aversion coefficient reported from 1992 to 2017. We examine 607 empirical estimates of loss aversion from 150 articles in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and several other disciplines. Our analysis indicates that the mean loss aversion coefficient is 1.955 with a 95 percent probability that the true value falls in the interval [1.820, 2.102].

Journal of Economic Literature,2024,Nonparametric Approaches to Empirical Welfare Analysis,Debopam Bhattacharya,"Welfare analysis of policy interventions is ubiquitous in economic research. It plays an important role in merger analysis and antitrust litigation, design of tax and subsidies, and informs the current debate on a universal basic income. This paper provides a survey of existing empirical methods, based on cross-sectional microdata, for calculating welfare effects and deadweight loss resulting from realized or hypothetical policy change. We briefly outline classical parametric methods that are computationally tractable, then discuss recent nonparametric approaches that avoid making statistical and functional-form restrictions on individual preferences. This makes the welfare estimates theoretically more credible, and clarifies exactly what welfare-relevant information is contained in demand distribution in various choice settings. However, these methods also demand greater in-sample variation in the data for practical implementation than classical parametric approaches. We then cover settings with externalities. The above results are theoretical, and take the demand function as known; therefore, we briefly discuss empirical problems around demand estimation. We conclude by suggesting areas for future research.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20221534

We analyze strategic decisions made by dictators from the standpoint of maximizing the chances of regime survival in the light of these challenges, and show how it explains multiple common patterns, from hiring political loyalists to positions that require competence, to restricting media freedom at the cost of sacrificing bureaucratic efficiency, to running propaganda campaigns, organizing election fraud, purging opponents and associates, and repressing citizens.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20221494

First, we present long-term trends in economic development, illustrating that throughout history, Russia significantly underperformed advanced economies, and quantify the human cost of Joseph Stalin's dictatorship. Second, we discuss studies of imperial Russia focusing on the causes of Russia's relatively low level of economic development and the 1917 revolution. The third strand of the literature focuses on the Soviet period, explaining its slowdown over time and eventual collapse.

Journal of Economic Literature,2024,"Mediation, Military, and Money: The Promises and Pitfalls of Outside Interventions to End Armed Conflicts",Dominic Rohner,"Wars impose tremendous costs on societies and the question of how to end them is of foremost importance. Several hundred books and scientific articles have been written on peace agreements and third-party interventions. In this article I provide a critical literature survey on what policies foreign countries have at their disposal if they wish to foster peace abroad. Ranging from pure (nonmilitarized) mediation, over a range of military options to economic policies, the promises and pitfalls of these types of interventions are critically assessed in the light of cutting-edge theoretical and empirical literature. A series of take-home messages emerge: (i) establishing a causal effect of mediation has proven difficult; (ii) military peacekeeping operations can play a key role, to the extent that security guarantees, the sharing of political and military power, and trust-building measures are well coordinated; and (iii) money matters—fostering human capital and economic opportunities contributes to fertile ground for lasting peace.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20221603

Comparing the post-2005 period with the preceding decade for five advanced economies, we seek to explain a slowdown of 0.8 to 1.8 pp. No single explanation accounts for the slowdown, but we have identified a combination of factors that, taken together, account for much of what has been observed. In the countries we have studied, these are mismeasurement, a decline in the contribution of capital per worker, lower spillovers from the growth of intangible capital, the slowdown in trade, and a lower growth of allocative efficiency. Sectoral reallocation and a lower contribution of human capital may also have played a role in some countries. In addition to our quantitative assessment of explanations for the slowdown, we qualitatively assess other explanations, including whether productivity growth may be declining due to innovation slowing down.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20221543

It is relatively even slower at the extremes. Much of the lag, especially at the extremes, arises from authors' dilatory behavior in revisions. Additional rounds of resubmissions at top economics journals are related to additional citations; but conditional on resubmission, the delays are unrelated to greater scholarly attention.

This review explains and assesses Marglin's argument for the possibility of a persistent equilibrium in which goods and/or labor markets continue not to clear in the absence of active stabilization policy. It also compares Marglin's analysis with that of New Keynesian models, and shows that the two approaches are more similar than might be immediately evident.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20221712
