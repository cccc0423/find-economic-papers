Journal of Political Economy,2024,The Bank of Amsterdam and the Limits of Fiat Money,"Wilko Bolt, Jon Frost, Hyun Song Shin and Peter Wierts","Central banks can operate with negative equity, and many have done so in history without undermining trust in fiat money. However, there are limits. How negative can central bank equity be before fiat money loses credibility? We address this question using a global game approach motivated by the fall of the Bank of Amsterdam (1609–1820). We solve for the unique break point where negative equity and asset illiquidity render fiat money worthless. We draw lessons on the role of fiscal support and central bank capital in sustaining trust in fiat money.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732524
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Detecting Drivers of Behavior at an Early Age: Evidence from a Longitudinal Field Experiment,"Marco Castillo, John List, Ragan Petrie and Anya Samek","We investigate how skills developed when children are 3–5 years old drive schooling outcomes in middle childhood and adolescence. We find that skills map onto three distinct factors—cognitive skills, executive functions, and economic preferences. Importantly, each of the three factors predict later schooling outcomes. While early executive function skills and cognitive scores are linked to future behavioral patterns and other key student outcomes, economic preferences have an independent effect: children who are impatient in early childhood have more disciplinary referrals. Finally, random assignment to preschool impacts grades and disciplinary referrals through changes to cognitive skills and executive functions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/731409
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Selective-Memory Equilibrium,"Drew Fudenberg, Giacomo Lanzani and Philipp Strack","We study agents who are more likely to remember some experiences than others but update beliefs as if the experiences they remember are the only ones that occurred. To understand the long-run effects of selective memory, we propose selective-memory equilibrium. We show that if the agent’s behavior converges, their limit strategy is a selective-memory equilibrium, and we provide a sufficient condition for behavior to converge. We use this equilibrium concept to explore the consequences of several well-documented biases. We also show that there is a close connection between selective-memory equilibria and the outcomes of misspecified learning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/731412
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Heterogeneity and Aggregate Fluctuations,"Minsu Chang, Xiaohong Chen and Frank Schorfheide","We develop a state-space model with a transition equation that takes the form of a functional vector autoregression (VAR) and stacks macroeconomic aggregates and a cross-sectional density. The measurement equation captures the error in estimating log densities from repeated cross-sectional samples. The log densities and their transition kernels are approximated by sieves, which leads to a finite-dimensional VAR for macroeconomic aggregates and sieve coefficients. With this model, we study the dynamics of technology shocks, GDP (gross domestic product), employment, and the earnings distribution. We find that spillovers between aggregate and distributional dynamics are generally small, that a positive technology shock tends to decrease inequality, and that a shock that raises earnings inequality leads to a small and insignificant GDP response.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/731411
Journal of Political Economy,2024,The Intertemporal Keynesian Cross,"Adrien Auclert, Matthew Rognlie and Ludwig Straub","We generalize the traditional, static Keynesian cross by deriving an intertemporal Keynesian cross for the dynamic output response to government spending and taxes in microfounded general equilibrium models. Intertemporal marginal propensities to consume (iMPCs) are sufficient statistics for this response, with fiscal multipliers depending only on the interaction between iMPCs and public deficits. We provide empirical estimates of iMPCs and argue that they are inconsistent with representative agent or two-agent models but can be matched by certain heterogeneous agent models. Models that match empirical iMPCs imply larger and more persistent output responses to deficit-financed fiscal policy, with cumulative spending multipliers above 1.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732531
Journal of Political Economy,2024,(Near-)Substitute Preferences and Equilibria with Indivisibilities,Thanh Nguyen and Rakesh Vohra,"An obstacle to using market mechanisms to allocate indivisible goods is the lack of competitive equilibria (CEs). Arrow and Hahn introduced social-approximate equilibria: price vectors with “small” excess demands. We define preferences called Δ-substitutes, where social-approximate equilibria exist with good-by-good excess demand bounded by 2(Δ−1), independent of economy size. For Δ=1, CEs exist even with income effects. A Δ greater than 1 allows for richer substitutability and complementarity patterns, broadening the scope for market mechanisms to allocate indivisible goods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/731413
Journal of Political Economy,2024,The Impact of Divorce Laws on the Equilibrium in the Marriage Market,Ana Reynoso,"Does easier divorce affect who marries whom? I exploit time variation in the adoption of unilateral divorce across the United States and show that it increases assortative matching among newlyweds. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, I estimate a novel life-cycle equilibrium model of marriage, labor supply, consumption, and divorce under the baseline mutual consent divorce regime. By solving the model under unilateral divorce, I find that, consistent with the data, assortative matching increases. Effects are largely due to changes in choices when risk sharing and cooperation within marriage decrease, which highlights the importance of considering equilibrium effects when evaluating family policies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732532

Journal of Political Economy,2024,Growth Off the Rails: Aggregate Productivity Growth in Distorted Economies,Richard Hornbeck and Martin Rotemberg,"We examine aggregate economic gains in the United States as the railroad network expanded in the nineteenth century. Using data from the Census of Manufactures, we estimate relative increases in county aggregate productivity from relative increases in county market access. In general equilibrium, we find that the railroads substantially increased national aggregate productivity. By accounting for input distortions, we estimate much larger aggregate economic gains from the railroads than previous estimates. Our estimates highlight how broadly-used infrastructure or technologies can have much larger economic impacts when there are inefficiencies in the economy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730548
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Safe Assets,"Markus K. Brunnermeier, Sebastian Merkel and Yuliy Sannikov","The price of a safe asset reflects not only the expected discounted future cash flows but also future service flows, since retrading allows partial insurance of idiosyncratic risk in an incomplete markets setting. This lowers the issuers’ interest burden. As idiosyncratic risk rises during recessions, so does the value of the service flows bestowing the safe asset with a negative β. The resulting exorbitant privilege resolves government debt valuation puzzles and allows the government to run a permanent (primary) deficit without ever paying back its debt, but the government faces a debt Laffer curve.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730547
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Private Monopoly and Restricted Entry—Evidence from the Notary Profession,Frank Verboven and Biliana Yontcheva,"We study entry restrictions in a private monopoly: the Latin notary system. Under this widespread system, the state grants notaries exclusive rights to certify important economic transactions, including real estate. To uncover the current policy goals behind the geographic entry restrictions, we develop an empirical entry model that incorporates a spatial demand model and a multioutput production model. We find that the entry restrictions serve primarily producer interests and give only a small weight to consumer surplus. We show how reform would generate considerable welfare improvements and imply a substantial redistribution toward consumers without threatening geographic coverage.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730549
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Efficient Allocation of Indivisible Goods in Pseudomarkets with Constraints,"Faruk Gul, Wolfgang Pesendorfer and Mu Zhang",We provide conditions under which a market mechanism can be used to allocate indivisible goods efficiently. We consider an economy with no transfers and show the existence and efficiency of Walrasian equilibria in the corresponding pseudomarket with stochastic consumption. We demonstrate that constraints on minimum and maximum levels of individual consumption and aggregate constraints of the kind that are relevant in combinatorial allocation problems can be accommodated either by incorporating these constraints into individual preferences or by specifying a suitable production technology.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730561
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Inferring Trade-Offs in University Admissions: Evidence from Cambridge,Debopam Bhattacharya and Julia Shvets,"How do elite universities balance diversity and academics during admissions? We develop a theory-based empirical framework to identify and quantify this potential trade-off, using postentry outcomes. We apply this to matched admission and exam-performance data from Cambridge. Comparing first- versus second-round admits from different demographic groups yields bounds on the trade-off magnitude, which (a) hold irrespective of whether we observe all applicant characteristics and (b) require no information on rejected applicants. We find robust evidence of trade-off between gender balance and future performance in math-intensive subjects but not for state/private school students or for gender in competitive nonmathematical disciplines.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730544
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Cadasters and Economic Growth: A Long-Run Cross-Country Panel,"Michelle D’Arcy, Marina Nistotskaya and Ola Olsson","Cadasters are public records of land ownership that facilitate clear assignment of property rights and land demarcation, thereby reducing transaction costs for economic agents and strengthening the state’s capacity to tax. Macro-level research on the evolution of formal land registration has largely been lacking. Using a novel dataset on the emergence and development of state-administered cadasters in 159 countries over the past millennium, we analyze empirically the association between the development of cadastral institutions and long-run economic growth. Our findings suggest a substantive positive effect of the introduction of cadasters on modern per capita income levels.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730551
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Regulation of Organ Transplantation and Procurement: A Market-Design Lab Experiment,Alex Chan and Alvin Roth,"We conduct a lab experiment that shows that current rules regulating transplant centers (TCs) and organ-procurement organizations (OPOs) create perverse incentives that inefficiently reduce both organ recovery and beneficial transplantations. We model the decision environment with a two-player multiround game between an OPO and a TC. In the condition that simulates current rules, OPOs recover only the highest-quality kidneys and forgo valuable recovery opportunities, and TCs decline some beneficial transplants. Alternative regulations that reward TCs and OPOs together for health outcomes in their entire patient pool lead to behaviors that increase organ recovery and appropriate transplants.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730546
Journal of Political Economy,2024,The Network Origins of Entry,"Arthur Campbell, Philip Ushchev and Yves Zenou","We develop a model of market entry under social learning through word of mouth (WOM). The success of an entrant depends on consumer awareness generated via WOM, modeled as a percolation process on a random graph. The likelihood of an entrant gaining significant awareness depends on network structure, characterized by the first three factorial moments of the degree distribution. We identify three pricing equilibria: blockaded, deterred, and accommodated entry. The model demonstrates that increased network density can shift equilibria from blockaded to deterred and eventually to accommodated entry. Numerical simulations suggest that consumer surplus may be nonmonotonic with respect to network density. Additionally, if incumbents can charge personalized prices based on consumers' connectivity, they may optimally set lower prices for highly connected consumers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730550
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Technology Adoption and Productivity Growth: Evidence from Industrialization in France,"Réka Juhász, Mara P. Squicciarini and Nico Voigtländer","New technologies tend to be adopted slowly and—even after being adopted—take time to be reflected in higher aggregate productivity. One prominent explanation is that major technological breakthroughs create the need to reorganize production. We study a unique setting that allows us to examine this mechanism: the adoption of mechanized cotton spinning during the first Industrial Revolution in France. Using a novel hand-collected, plant-level dataset from French archival sources, we show that a process of “trial and error” in reorganizing production led to initially low and widely dispersed productivity across firms operating the new technology. In the subsequent decades, we observe high productivity growth as knowledge diffused through the economy and new entrants adopted improved methods of organizing production.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730205
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Big G,"Lydia Cox, Gernot Müller, Ernesto Pasten, Raphael Schoenle and Michael Weber","“Big G” typically refers to aggregate government spending on a homogeneous good. We confront this notion with five facts for the universe of federal purchases. First, they are volatile and account for the largest part of the short-run variation in total spending. Second, the origin of their variation is granular. Third, purchases are subject to procurement and bidding. Fourth, they are concentrated in long-term contracts. Fifth, their composition is biased toward sectors in which private sector prices are sticky. We develop a two-sector New Keynesian model consistent with these facts and find where the government spends is key for aggregate effects.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730426
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Funding of Clinical Trials and Reported Drug Efficacy,Tamar Oostrom,"This paper estimates the effect of financial sponsorship of clinical trials on reported drug efficacy, leveraging the insight that the exact same pairs of drugs are often compared in different trials conducted by parties with different financial interests. I assemble new psychiatric trial data to estimate that a drug appears substantially more effective when the trial is sponsored by that drug’s manufacturer, compared with the same drug tested against the same combination of drugs but without sponsorship. This difference is not explained by observable characteristics, but publication bias is important. Preregistration may be effective in overcoming this bias.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730383
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Learning about the Long Run,"Leland E. Farmer, Emi Nakamura and Jón Steinsson","Forecasts of professional forecasters are anomalous: they are biased, and forecast errors are autocorrelated and predictable by forecast revisions. We propose that these anomalies arise because professional forecasters do not know the model that generates the data. We show that Bayesian agents learning about hard-to-learn features of the world can generate all the prominent aggregate anomalies emphasized in the literature. We show this for professional forecasts of nominal interest rates and Congressional Budget Office forecasts of gross domestic product growth. Our learning model for interest rates can explain observed deviations from the expectations hypothesis of the term structure without relying on time variation in risk premia.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730207
Journal of Political Economy,2024,"Strategic Inattention, Inflation Dynamics, and the Nonneutrality of Money",Hassan Afrouzi,"This paper studies how competition affects firms’ expectations in a new dynamic general equilibrium model with rational inattention and oligopolistic competition where firms acquire information about their competitors’ beliefs. In the model, firms with fewer competitors are less attentive to aggregate variables—a novel prediction supported by survey evidence. A calibrated version of the model matches the relationship between firms’ numbers of competitors and their uncertainty about aggregate inflation as a nontargeted moment. A quantitative exercise reveals that firms’ strategic inattention to aggregates significantly amplifies monetary nonneutrality and shifts output response disproportionately toward less competitive oligopolies by distorting relative prices.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730201
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Reputation Effects under Short Memories,Harry Pei,"I analyze a reputation game between a patient player and a sequence of short-run players. Each short-run player observes the number of times that the patient player took each of his actions in the past K periods. When players have monotone supermodular payoffs, the patient player can approximately secure his commitment payoff in all equilibria regardless of K. I also show that the short-run players can approximately attain their highest feasible payoff in all equilibria if and only if K is lower than some cutoff. This is because a larger K weakens the short-run players’ incentives to punish the patient player.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730203
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Prices and Policies in Opioid Markets,Casey B. Mulligan,"Opioid mortality increases have been linked to both lax and restrictive opioid prescription regulations. Modeling choice between prescription and illicitly manufactured opioid sources helps reconcile the apparently contradictory empirical findings. It also identifies groups responding opposite of the average and applies previous studies to new supply conditions. Organized around the two supply channels, a policy database is assembled that reveals distinct pricing phases during 1999–2021. Consistent with the model, during the later phases the relationship between the opioid fatality rate (measured from death certificates) and its composition changes sign, minors’ fatality rates trend opposite of adults’, and the black-white gap changes sign.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730381

This paper studies intergenerational insurance that maximizes the expected discounted utility of all generations subject to participation constraints for each generation. If complete insurance is unattainable, the optimal intergenerational insurance is history dependent even when the environment is stationary. The risk from a generational shock is spread into the future with periodic “resetting.” If we interpret intergenerational insurance in terms of debt, the fiscal reaction function is nonlinear and the risk premium on debt is lower than the risk premium with complete insurance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730206
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Organizing for Collective Action: Olson Revisited,Marco Battaglini and Thomas Palfrey,"We characterize optimal honest and obedient (HO) mechanisms for the classic collective action problem with private information, where group success requires costly participation by some fraction of its members. For large n, a simple HO mechanism, the volunteer-based organization, is approximately optimal. Success is achieved in the limit with probability one or zero depending on the rate at which the required fraction declines with n. For finite n, optimal HO mechanisms provide substantial gains over unorganized groups when the success probability converges to zero, because the optimal HO success probability converges slowly and is always positive, while finite-sized unorganized groups have exactly zero probability of success.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/729580
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Out of the Darkness and into the Light? Development Effects of Rural Electrification,Fiona Burlig and Louis Preonas,"Nearly 1 billion people still lack electricity access. Developing countries are investing billions of dollars in “last-mile” electrification, although evidence on its economic impacts is mixed. We estimate the development effects of rural electrification in the context of India’s national electrification program, RGGVY (Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana), which reached over 400,000 villages. Using regression-discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, we estimate that RGGVY meaningfully expanded electricity access. However, the program generated limited economic impacts after 3–5 years. Scaling our intent-to-treat estimates using instrumental variables, we find that “full electrification” reduces welfare in small villages but has a 33% internal rate of return in large villages.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730204

An Experimental Approach,"Janet Hua Jiang, Peter Norman, Daniela Puzzello, Bruno Sultanum and Randall Wright","Monetary exchange is called essential when better outcomes become incentive compatible when money is introduced. We study essentiality theoretically and experimentally using finite-horizon monetary models that are naturally suited to the lab. Following mechanism design, we also study the effects of strategy recommendations both when they are incentive compatible and when they are not. Results show that output and welfare are significantly enhanced by fiat currency if monetary equilibrium exists but not otherwise. Also, recommendations help if incentive compatible but not otherwise. Sometimes money gets used when it should not, and we investigate why, using surveys and measures of social preferences.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/730199

Reviewer recommendations are similarly influenced by PhD and employment matches.

Motivated by these findings, we develop a theory of credit lines and labor income risk to analyze optimal transfers to the unemployed. Since credit lines offer fixed interest rates and limits, credit lines are unresponsive to layoffs and provide greater consumption insurance relative to when debt is repriced period by period. At US levels of credit lines, the government can optimally reduce transfers to the unemployed, whereas this is not true when debt is counterfactually repriced period by period.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/729583

Study 1 finds that male-majority teams accord disproportionately less influence to women and are less likely to choose women to represent the team externally. We replicate this finding in a new context, where we also vary the gender of an assigned team leader. We find that a female leader substantially increases women’s influence, even in male-majority teams.

Bank records from Iceland show that borrowers have especially low liquidity just before getting a loan. Borrowers exhibit lower decision-making ability (DMA) in linked-choice experiments: 45% of loan dollars go to the bottom 20% of the DMA distribution. Standard determinants of demand do not explain this relationship, which is also mirrored by the relationship between DMA and an unambiguous mistake.

Structural changes may generate long-lasting mobility trends that can be nonmonotonic, and declining mobility may reflect past gains rather than a recent deterioration of equality of opportunity. We provide two applications. We first show that changes in the parent generation have partially offset the effect of rising skill premia on income mobility in the United States. We then show that a Swedish school reform reduced the transmission of inequalities in the directly affected generation but increased their persistence in the next.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/729582

In a series of field experiments involving more than 5,000 participants, we investigate how incentives alter behavior in teams working on such a task. We document a positive effect of bonus incentives on performance, even among teams with strong intrinsic motivation. Bonuses also transform team organization by enhancing the demand for leadership.

The DeGroot rule is chosen in equilibrium if and only if there is noiseless information transmission, leading to consensus. With noisy transmission, while some disagreement is inevitable, the optimal choice of rule amplifies the disagreement: even with little noise, individuals place substantial weight on their own initial opinion in every period, exacerbating the disagreement. We use this framework to think about equilibrium versus socially efficient choice of rules and its connection to polarization of opinions across groups.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/729448

We estimate the causal contribution of combat deployments to declining veteran well-being. Deployments increase injuries, combat deaths, and disability compensation, but we find limited effects on suicide, deaths of despair, financial health, incarceration, or education.

Estimates of top income shares based only on individual tax returns are biased by tax-base changes, social changes, and missing income sources. This paper addresses these shortcomings and presents new estimates of the distribution of national income since 1960. Our analysis of pretax income shows that top income shares are lower and have increased less since 1980 than other studies using tax data. In addition, increasing government transfers and tax progressivity have resulted in rising real incomes for all income groups and little change in aftertax top income shares.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728741

A disclosure policy is credible if the sender cannot profit from tampering with her messages while keeping the message distribution unchanged. We show that the credibility of a disclosure policy is equivalent to a cyclical monotonicity condition on the policy’s induced distribution over states and actions. We also characterize how credibility restricts the sender’s ability to persuade under different payoff structures. In particular, when the sender’s payoff is state independent, all disclosure policies are credible.

We first show that the expansion of the platform raised on-time graduation rates. We then develop and estimate a model of college applications, offers, wait lists, matriculation, and graduation. When the platform expands, welfare increases, and welfare, enrollment, and graduation rates are less sensitive to off-platform frictions. Gains are larger for students from lower-socioeconomic-status backgrounds.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/729068

Using a dynamic model of competitive resource extraction, we show that improving property right security unambiguously increases conservation incentives, but the effect of credit markets on resource extraction effort hinges on the security of property rights. We test these predictions using data on global fisheries, credit markets, and the largest ever marine property rights assignment. We find that property right security reduces resource extraction and that credit market development increases resource extraction under insecure property rights but reduces resource extraction under secure property rights.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/729065

First, we show that older people tend to underestimate their cognitive decline. We then show that those experiencing a severe decline but unaware of it are more likely to suffer wealth losses. These losses largely reflect decreases in financial wealth and are mainly experienced by wealthier people who were previously active on the stock market. Our findings support the view that financial losses among older people unaware of their cognitive decline are the result of bad financial decisions, not of rational disinvestment strategies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/728697

Such “nonmarket” mechanisms sacrifice some surplus, yet they can potentially improve equity. We develop a model of mechanism design with redistributive concerns. Agents are characterized by a privately observed willingness to pay for quality, a publicly observed label, and a social welfare weight. A market designer controls allocation and pricing of a set of objects of heterogeneous quality and maximizes the expectation of a welfare function. The designer does not directly observe individuals’ social welfare weights.

Patented financial innovations are substantial and increasingly economically important. Their subject matter has changed, consistent with the industry’s shift toward household investors and borrowers. Information technology (IT) and other nonfinancial firms drove the surge in financial patenting. The location of innovation shifted, with banks moving activity away from states with tight financial regulation and high-tech regions attracting innovation by payments, IT, and nonfinancial firms.

Adding a worker doubled net preschool instructional time and led to increases of 0.28σ and 0.46σ in math and language test scores after 18 months for children who remained enrolled in the program and 0.13σ and 0.10σ for all children enrolled at baseline.

We rationalize these important facts in a model featuring endogenous front-running. Although an additional contact intensifies competition and aids in finding a natural counterparty, it also intensifies information leakage—which can be costly if it helps a losing dealer to front-run.

This result emerges in a small open-economy model with downward nominal wage rigidity and is supported by new empirical evidence based on panel data from different exchange-rate regimes. The exchange-rate regime, economic slack, inflation, and how spending is financed all matter for the fiscal transmission mechanism in the way predicted by the model.

We show that when high-markup firms have lower pass-throughs than low-markup firms, then positive demand shocks, such as monetary expansions, alleviate cross-sectional misallocation by reallocating resources to high-markup firms. Consequently, positive “demand shocks” are accompanied by endogenous positive “supply shocks” that raise productivity and lower inflation. We derive a tractable, four-equation model where monetary shocks generate hump-shaped productivity responses. In our calibration, the supply-side effect amplifies the total impact of monetary shocks on output by about 70%.

Motivated by such cases, we study correlated equilibria in first-price procurement auctions with complete information, where bidders who disobey their recommendations are penalized. Cartel-optimal profit is greater when more information about submitted bids is disclosed at auction and when the maximum penalty is larger. When only the winner’s identity is disclosed (or the winner’s identity and bid), cartels do not benefit from mediation. Our main result characterizes the cartel-optimal equilibrium with two symmetric bidders when both bids are disclosed. The optimal equilibrium involves extensive randomization and displays tied bids and high winning bids with positive probability, even when the maximum penalty is very small. The stationary mediation schemes we consider are always more profitable for the cartel than bid rotation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/727710

Because adoption dates are unknown, we identify adopting stations by testing for structural breaks in AP markers, finding most breaks to be around the time of widespread AP introduction. Because station adoption is endogenous, we instrument using headquarter adoption. Adoption increases margins but only for nonmonopoly stations.

Using insights from discrete geometry, we study a tractable limit case of this problem in which these forces operate at a local level. Our analysis delivers predictions on sorting across space.

This can be rationalized by a bidimensional matching framework where women’s human capital is negatively correlated with another valuable trait: fertility, or reproductive capital. Such a model predicts nonmonotonicity in income matching with a sufficiently high income distribution of men.

We show that financially constrained firms cut investment more than unconstrained firms following an uncertainty shock.

In a standard New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, uncertainty shocks are proven to be superadditive only when the model is solved under fourth- (or higher-)order perturbation. The fourth-order solution unlocks the fourth derivative of marginal utility, “edginess,” which is key to generating stronger reactions to multiple risks and superadditivity.

While the official poverty rate fell from 19.5% in 1963 to 10.5% in 2019, our absolute full-income poverty measure—which uses a fuller income measure and updates thresholds only for inflation—fell from 19.5% to 1.6%. However, we also show that relative poverty reductions have been modest. Additionally, government dependence increased over this time, with the share of working-age adults receiving under half their income from market sources more than doubling.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725705
Journal of Political Economy,2024,"Estimation of a Life-Cycle Model with Human Capital, Labor Supply, and Retirement","Xiaodong Fan, Ananth Seshadri and Christopher Taber","We estimate a life-cycle model of consumption, human capital investment, and labor supply. The interaction between human capital and labor supply toward the end of the life cycle is most novel. The estimates replicate the main features of the data, in particular the large increase in wages and small increase in labor supply at the beginning of the life cycle and the small decrease in wages but large decrease in labor supply toward the end. We show that incorporating human capital is critical when analyzing changes to Social Security.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726232
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Market Segmentation and Competition in Health Insurance,"Michael J. Dickstein, Kate Ho and Nathaniel Mark","In the United States, households obtain health insurance through distinct market segments. To explore the economics of this segmentation, we consider the effects of pooling coverage provided through small employers and through individual marketplaces. We model households’ demand for insurance and health care along with insurers’ price setting to predict equilibrium choices and premiums. Applying our model to data from Oregon, we find that pooling can mitigate adverse selection in the individual market and benefit small group households without raising taxpayer costs. Our estimates provide insight into the effects of new regulations that allow employers to shift coverage to individual marketplaces.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725707
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Spatial Influences in Upward Mobility,Garrett Anstreicher,"This paper extends a canonical model of intergenerational human capital investment to a geographic context to study the role of migration in influencing income mobility in the United States. The main result is that migration is considerably influential in shaping the high rates of economic mobility observed among children from low-wage areas, with human capital investment behavioral responses being important to consider. Equalizing school quality across locations does more to reduce interstate inequality in income mobility than equalizing skill prices, and policies that attempt to decrease human capital flight from low-wage areas via cash transfers are unlikely to be cost-effective.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725706
Journal of Political Economy,2024,O-Ring Production Networks,"Banu Demir, Ana Cecília Fieler, Yi Xu and Kelly Kaili Yang","We document strong skill matching in Turkish firms’ production networks. Additionally, in the data, export demand shocks from rich countries increase firms’ skill intensity and their trade with skill-intensive domestic partners. We explain these patterns using a quantitative model with heterogeneous firms, quality choices, and endogenous networks. A counterfactual economy-wide export demand shock of 5% leads both exporters and nonexporters to upgrade quality, raising the average wage by 1.2%. This effect is nine times the effect in a scenario without interconnected quality choices. We use the model to study the conditions for the success of export promotion policies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725703
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Investing with the Government: A Field Experiment in China,"Emanuele Colonnelli, Bo Li and Ernest Liu","We conduct a large-scale, nondeceptive field experiment to elicit preferences for government participation in China's venture capital and private equity market. Our main result is that the average firm dislikes investors with government ties. We show that such dislike is not present with government-owned firms and that this dislike is highest with best-performing firms. Additional results and surveys suggest that political interference in decision-making is the leading reason why government investors are unattractive to private firms. Overall, our findings point to the limits of a model of “state capitalism” that strongly relies on the complementarity between private firms and government capital to drive high-growth entrepreneurship and innovation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726237
Journal of Political Economy,2024,Cultural Values and Productivity,Andreas Ek,"This paper estimates differences in human capital as country-of-origin-specific labor productivity terms in firm production functions, making it immune to wage discrimination concerns. After accounting for education and experience, estimated human capital varies by a factor of around three between the 90th and the 10th percentile. When I investigate which country-of-origin characteristics most closely correlate with human capital, cultural values are the only robust predictor. This relationship persists among children of migrants. Consistent with a plausible cultural mechanism, individuals whose origin places a high value on autonomy hold a comparative advantage in positions characterized by a low degree of routinization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/726239
