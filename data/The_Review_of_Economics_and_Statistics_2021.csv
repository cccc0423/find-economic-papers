The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Dynamic Electoral Returns of a Large Antipoverty Program,Laura Zimmermann,"Governments around the world use short-term reelection strategies. This is problematic if governments can maximize their reelection chances by prioritizing short-term spending before an election over long-term reforms. This paper tests whether longer program exposure has a causal effect on election outcomes in the context of a large antipoverty program in India. Using a regression-discontinuity framework, the results show that length of program exposure lowers electoral support for the government. The paper discusses a couple of potential explanations, finding that the most plausible mechanism is that voters hold the government accountable for the program's implementation quality.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00935
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Improving Child Health and Cognition: Evidence from a School-Based Nutrition Intervention in India,"Marion Kramer, Santosh Kumar and Sebastian Vollmer","We present experimental evidence on the impact of the use of double-fortified salt in school meals on anemia, cognition, and the learning outcomes of primary school children in rural Bihar, one of the poorest regions of India. We find that a year-long intervention had statistically significant positive impacts on hemoglobin levels and reduced anemia by 20%; however, these health gains did not translate into significant impacts on cognitive performance, test scores, and school attendance. Treatment effects on anemia and test scores were larger for children with higher school attendance. The findings indicate that school-based health interventions are a cost-effective and scalable approach for reducing anemia among school children in resource-constrained countries.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00950

The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Value of Reputation in Trade: Evidence from Alibaba,Maggie Chen and Min Wu,"We examine the role of an online reputation mechanism in international trade by exploring T-shirt exports on Alibaba. Exploiting rich transaction data and features of search and rating algorithms, we show that exporters displaying a superior reputation perform significantly better than peers with nearly identical true ratings and observables, and the value of reputation rises with the level of information friction and the specificity of information. We develop a dynamic reputation model with heterogeneous cross-country information friction to quantify the effect of the reputation mechanism and find a 20% increase in aggregate exports fueled by a market reallocation towards superstars.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00932
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Product Mix and Firm Productivity Responses to Trade Competition,"Thierry Mayer, Marc Melitz and Gianmarco Ottaviano","We document how demand shocks in export markets lead French multiproduct exporters to reallocate the mix of products sold in those destinations. In response to positive demand shocks, French firms skew their export sales toward their best-performing products. We develop a theoretical model of multiproduct firms and derive the specific demand conditions (with endogenous price elasticities) needed to generate these product-mix reallocations. Under those demand conditions, the increased competition from demand shocks in export markets also induces productivity changes within the firm. We empirically test for this connection between demand shocks and the productivity of multiproduct firms. We find that this connection is economically substantial.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00952
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,"Capital and Labor: The Factor Income Composition of Top Incomes in the United States, 1962-2006",Anthony Atkinson and Christoph Lakner,"This paper finds that capital and labor incomes in the United States have become more closely associated since the 1980s. This has contributed to the well-known increase in the top 1% share of total income, exacerbating rising inequality in capital incomes and earnings. We show that the trend in the association is U-shaped as the recent increase contrasts with a tendency toward a weakening association until the 1980s. The paper, using data derived from tax records, studies the asymmetries in the association and tests for robustness to alternative income definitions, including the role of income from closely held businesses at the top.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01063

The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Interest Rate Pass-Through and Consumption Response: The Deposit Channel,"Sumit Agarwal, Souphala Chomsisengphet, Yildiray Yildirim and Jian Zhang","This study assesses a new mechanism, the deposit channel, in the transmission of interest rate shock to household consumption using an administrative panel data set of financial transactions for Turkey. Our empirical strategy exploits variation in consumers' adherence to the Islamic laws that forbid earning interest and employs a standard difference-in-difference design. Following an unanticipated announcement of interest rate hike, rate-sensitive consumers significantly reduce their overall spending, and the response persists throughout the post-announcement period. The response of debt payment, disparate exposure to inflation, exchange rate, and the demographic difference can hardly fully account for the documented consumption response heterogeneity.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00941
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Dynamic Impact of FX Interventions on Financial Markets,"Lukas Menkhoff, Malte Rieth and Tobias Stohr","Evidence on the effectiveness of foreign exchange (FX) interventions is either limited to short horizons or hampered by debatable identification. We address these limitations by identifying a structural vector autoregressive model for the daily frequency with an external instrument. Generally we find, for freely floating currencies, that FX intervention shocks significantly affect exchange rates and that this impact persists for months. The signaling channel dominates the portfolio channel. Moreover, interest rates tend to fall in response to sales of the domestic currency, whereas stock prices of large (exporting) firms increase after devaluation of the domestic currency.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00928
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Impact of Open Access Mandates on Invention,Kevin A. Bryan and Yasin Ozcan,"How do barriers to the diffusion of academic research affect innovation? In 2008, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandated free online availability of funded research. This policy caused a 50 percentage point increase in free access to funded articles. We introduce a novel measure, in-text patent citations, to study how this mandate affected industry use of academic science. After 2008, patents cite NIH-funded research 12% to 27% more often. Nonfunded research, funded research in journals unaffected by the mandate, and academic citations see no change. These estimates are consistent with a model of search for useful knowledge. Inefficiency caused by academic publishing may be substantial.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00926

Using a global data set on internet searches and two representative surveys from the United States, we document a substantial increase in economic anxiety during and after the arrival of the coronavirus. We also document a large dispersion in beliefs about the pandemic risk factors of the coronavirus and demonstrate that these beliefs causally affect individuals' economic anxieties. Finally, we show that individuals' mental models of infectious disease spread understate nonlinear growth and shape the extent of economic anxiety.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00946
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Unemployment Effects of Stay-at-Home Orders: Evidence from High-Frequency Claims Data,"ChaeWon Baek, Peter B. McCrory, Todd Messer and Preston Mui","We use the high-frequency, decentralized implementation of stay-at-home (SAH) orders in the United States to disentangle the labor market effects of SAH orders from the general economic disruption wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that each week of SAH exposure increased a state's weekly initial unemployment insurance (UI) claims by 1.9% of its employment level relative to other states. A back-of-the-envelope calculation implies that of the 17 million UI claims between March 14 and April 4, only 4 million were attributable to SAH orders. We present a currency union model to provide conditions for mapping this estimate to aggregate employment losses.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00996
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Exposure to the COVID-19 Stock Market Crash and Its Effect on Household Expectations,"Tobin Hanspal, Annika Weber and Johannes Wohlfart","We survey a representative sample of U.S. households to study how exposure to the COVID-19 stock market crash affects expectations and planned behavior. Wealth shocks are associated with upward adjustments of expectations about retirement age, desired working hours, and household debt but have only small effects on expected spending. We provide correlational and experimental evidence that beliefs about the duration of the stock market recovery shape households' expectations about their own wealth and their planned investment decisions and labor market activity. Our findings shed light on the implications of household exposure to stock market crashes for expectation formation.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01011
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Do People Avoid Morally Relevant Information? Evidence from the Refugee Crisis,Eleonora Freddi,"Combining click data from a Swedish newspaper and administrative data on asylum seekers in Sweden, I examine whether a larger presence of refugees in a municipality induces people to avoid news that may encourage welcoming the newcomers. Exploiting the unexpected inflow of refugees to Sweden during 2015 and their exogenous allocation across Swedish municipalities, I find that people living in municipalities where the relative number of refugees is larger read fewer articles about asylum seekers. The decrease in clicks is 36% larger for more empathic articles and is correlated with less engagement in activities aimed at welcoming refugees.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00934
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Welfare Consequences of Centralization: Evidence from a Quasi-Natural Experiment in Switzerland,Sarah Flèche,"Many countries are reallocating tasks and powers to more central levels of government. To identify centralization's welfare effects, I use a difference-in-differences design that relies on time and cross-cantonal variations in the implementation of centralization reforms in Switzerland. I find that centralization provokes significant decreases in residents' life satisfaction. I identify one mechanism driving the effect: the procedural disutility that individuals experience from having less influence over the formulation of political decisions. This effect is largest among individuals with higher expected benefits from being involved in the political decision process, with detrimental effects on local political participation.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00894
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Inferring Tax Compliance from Pass-Through: Evidence from Airbnb Tax Enforcement Agreements,"Andrew J. Bibler, Keith F. Teltser and Mark Tremblay","Tax enforcement is especially costly when market participants are difficult to observe. The benefits of enforcement depend crucially on pre-enforcement compliance. We derive an upper bound on pre-enforcement compliance from the pass-through of newly enforced taxes. Using data on Airbnb listings and the platform's voluntary collection agreements, we find that taxes are paid on, at most, 24% of Airbnb transactions prior to enforcement. We also find that demand for Airbnb listings is inelastic, driving three key insights: the tax burden falls disproportionately on renters, the excess burden is small, and tax enforcement is relatively ineffective at reducing local Airbnb activity.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00910
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Of Mice and Merchants: Connectedness and the Location of Economic Activity in the Iron Age,"Jan David Bakker, Stephan Maurer, Jorn-Steffen Pischke and Ferdinand Rauch","We study the causal relationship between geographic connectedness and development using one of the earliest massive trade expansions: the first systematic crossing of open seas in the Mediterranean during the time of the Phoenicians. We construct a geography-based measure of connectedness along the shores of the sea. We relate connectedness to economic activity, which we measure using the presence of archaeological sites. We find an association between better-connected locations and archaeological sites during the Iron Age, at a time when sailors began to cross open water routinely on a large scale. We corroborate these findings at the world level.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00902
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Estimating the Production Function under Input Market Frictions,Ajay Shenoy,"Behind many production function estimators lies a crucial assumption that the firm's choice of intermediate inputs depends only on observed choices of other inputs and on unobserved productivity. This assumption fails when market frictions distort the firm's input choices. I derive a test for the assumption, which is rejected in several industries. Using weak identification asymptotics, I show that when the assumption fails, a simplified dynamic panel estimator can be used instead of choice-based methods because it requires choices to be distorted. I propose criteria for choosing between estimators, which in simulations yield lower error than either estimator alone.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00927
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Farmer Field Days and Demonstrator Selection for Increasing Technology Adoption,Kyle Emerick and Manzoor H. Dar,"Inadequate learning is an oft-cited friction impeding the adoption of improved agricultural technology in the developing world. We provide experimental evidence that farmer field days, an approach used throughout the world where farmers meet, learn about new technology, and observe its performance, alleviate learning frictions and increase adoption of an improved seed by 40%. Further analysis demonstrates that these field days are both cost-effective and have a greater impact on poorer farmers. In contrast, we find no evidence that selecting the first adopters of new technology in participatory village meetings has any effect on future adoption.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00917
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Fertility Restrictions and Life Cycle Outcomes: Evidence from the One-Child Policy in China,"Wei Huang, Xiaoyan Lei and Ang Sun","This study considers the experience of China's one-child policy to examine how fertility restrictions affect economic and social outcomes over a lifetime. Using variations in these penalties across provinces and over time, we find that exposure to stricter fertility restrictions when young leads to higher education levels, more white-collar jobs, delayed marriage, and lower fertility rates. Further consequences include lower rates of residing with the elderly and higher household income, consumption, and savings. Finally, exposure to stricter fertility restrictions in early life increases female empowerment. Overall, fertility restrictions imposed when people are young have powerful effects throughout their life cycle.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00921
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Effects of Changes in Local Bank Health on Household Consumption,Daniel Cooper and Joe Peek,"This study investigates the relationship between credit availability and household consumption using a novel approach to separate credit demand and supply. We find that a deterioration in local-bank health reduces household consumption, with the strongest effects occurring for households that are more likely to need credit—especially those experiencing a negative income shock and having limited liquid assets. The main contributions of the study are the use of an arguably exogenous measure of local-bank health and multifaceted indicators of constrained households. Our findings contribute to the discussion of the linkages between the financial sector and real economic activity.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00914

The analysis combines 2005–2012 Medicare fee-for-service and enrollment data with merger and physician affiliation information from the Levin Reports and SK&A, respectively. We determine the effect of acquisitions on several health outcomes: mortality, acute myocardial infarctions, acute circulatory conditions, ischemic heart disease, glaucoma, symptomatic diabetes complications, and asymptomatic diabetes complications. These outcomes represent the progression of hypertension and diabetes into worse health states. Our results indicate that hospital acquisitions of existing physician practices have little effect on the health outcomes we consider.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00924
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Adaptation and the Mortality Effects of Temperature across U.S. Climate Regions,"Garth Heutel, Nolan H. Miller and David Molitor","We estimate how the mortality effects of temperature vary across U.S. climate regions to assess local and national damages from projected climate change. Using 22 years of Medicare data, we find that both cold and hot days increase mortality. However, hot days are less deadly in warm places while cold days are less deadly in cool places. Incorporating this heterogeneity into end-of-century climate change assessments reverses the conventional wisdom on climate damage incidence: cold places bear more, not less, of the mortality burden. Allowing places to adapt to their future climate substantially reduces the estimated mortality effects of climate change.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00936
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Minimum Wage and Real Wage Inequality: Evidence from Pass-Through to Retail Prices,Justin H. Leung,"This paper considers the impact of the minimum wage on both labor and product markets using detailed store-level scanner data. I provide empirical evidence that a 10% increase in the minimum wage raises grocery store prices by 0.6% to 0.8% and suggest that the minimum wage not only raises labor costs but also affects product demand, especially in poorer regions. This points to novel channels of heterogeneity in pass-through that have distributional consequences, with key implications for real wage inequality. I also find that price rigidity within retail chains ameliorates these effects, reducing the pass-through elasticity for retail prices by about 60%.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00915
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Torn Apart? The Impact of Manufacturing Employment Decline on Black and White Americans,Eric Gould,"This paper examines the impact of manufacturing employment decline on the socioeconomic outcomes within and between black and white Americans since 1960. The analysis shows that manufacturing decline had a negative impact on blacks in terms of their wages, employment, marriage rates, house values, poverty rates, death rates, single parenthood, teen motherhood, child poverty, and child mortality. In addition, the decline in manufacturing increased inequality within the black community for wages and other outcomes. Similar patterns are found for whites, but to a lesser degree—leading to larger gaps between whites and blacks in wages, marriage patterns, poverty, single-parenthood, and death rates.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00918
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Incentives and Careers in Academia: Theory and Empirical Analysis,"Daniele Checchi, Gianni De Fraja and Stefano Verzillo","We study career concerns in Italian academia. We mold our empirical analysis on the standard model of contests, formalized in the multiunit all-pay auction. The number of posts, the number of applicants, and the relative importance of the criteria for promotion determine academics' effort and output. In Italian universities, incentives operate only through promotion, and all appointment panels are drawn from strictly separated and relatively narrow scientific sectors. Thus, the parameters affecting payoffs can be measured quite precisely, and we take the model to a newly constructed data set that collects the journal publications of all Italian university professors. Our identification strategy is based on a reform introduced in 1999, parts of which affected different academics differently. We find that individual researchers respond to incentives in the manner described by the theoretical model: roughly, more capable researchers respond to increases in the importance of the publications for promotion and in the competitiveness of the scientific sector by exerting more effort; less able researchers are discouraged by competition and do the opposite.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00916
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Virtuous Cycle of Property,Marco Fabbri and Giuseppe Dari-Mattiacci,This paper shows that formalizing private property rights has a positive effect on the propensity to respect the property of others. We study a recent large-scale land tenure reform in West Africa that was the first of its kind to be implemented as a randomized control trial. Results of a modified dictator game show that the formalization of private property rights reduced an individual's willingness to take from others' endowment. We used additional experimental measures and postexperimental survey data to rule out alternative explanations for the observed behavior that do not imply a change in preferences.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00905

A Randomized Experiment in the Western Balkans,"Ana Paula Cusolito, Ernest Dautović and David McKenzie","Innovative firms with good ideas may still struggle to fine-tune them to the stage where they can attract outside funding. We conduct a five-country randomized experiment that tests the impact of an investment readiness program. Firms then pitched their ideas to independent judges. The program resulted in a 0.3 standard deviation increase in the investment readiness score. Two years later, the average impacts on firm investment outcomes are positive but small in magnitude and not statistically significant. Larger and statistically significant impacts on receiving outside funding occur for smaller firms and for firms with lower likelihoods of otherwise being funded.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00882
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Trade and Management,"Nicholas Bloom, Kalina Manova, John van Reenen, Stephen Teng Sun and Zhihong Yu","We study how management practices shape export performance using matched production-trade-management data for Chinese and American firms and a randomized control trial in India. Better-managed firms are more likely to export, sell more products to more destinations, and earn higher export revenues and profits. They export higher-quality products at higher prices and lower quality-adjusted prices. They import a wider range of inputs and inputs of higher quality and price, from more advanced countries. We rationalize these patterns with a heterogeneous-firm model in which effective management improves performance by raising production efficiency and quality capacity.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00925
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Energy Efficiency and Electricity Reliability,Eliana Carranza and Robyn Meeks,"Overloaded electrical systems are a major source of unreliable power. Using a randomized saturation design, we estimate the impact of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) on electricity reliability and household electricity consumption in the Kyrgyz Republic. Greater saturation of CFLs within a transformer leads to fewer outages, a technological externality benefiting all households, regardless of individual adoption. Spillovers in CFL adoption further reduce electricity consumption, contributing to increased reliability within a transformer. CFLs' impacts on household electricity consumption vary according to the effects on reliability. Receiving CFLs significantly reduces electricity consumption, but increased reliability permits greater consumption of electricity services.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00912
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Environmental Regulations and the Cleanup of Manufacturing: Plant-Level Evidence,Nouri Najjar and Jevan Cherniwchan,"For much of the industrialized world, pollution from manufacturing has been falling despite increased output. We examine how air quality standards---a common environmental regulation---have contributed to this cleanup of manufacturing. We develop a general equilibrium model to show how air quality standards can lead to a cleanup by causing reductions in plant emission intensity, relative changes in plant output, and plant entry and exit. We provide quasi-experimental evidence from Canada to highlight the magnitude of these responses. Our results suggest that air quality standards explain just under 40% of the cleanup of manufacturing.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00904

The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Relationship Lending and the Great Depression,"Jon Cohen, Kinda Hachem and Gary Richardson","The collapse of long-term lending relationships amplified the Great Depression. We demonstrate this by developing a new measure of lending relationships that can be calculated from widely available data at any level of aggregation. Our approach exploits differences in the responsiveness of loan rates to bank funding costs and is supported by historical evidence and theoretical arguments. The new measure reveals that the marginal impact of bank suspensions on economic activity was higher in more relationship-intensive areas, providing the first formal evidence that relationship lending propagated the real effects of banking sector distress in the early 1930s.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00899
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Ethnic Diversity and Growth: Revisiting the Evidence,José G. Montalvo and Marta Reynal-Querol,"The relationship between ethnic heterogeneity and economic growth is complex. Empirical research working with cross-country data finds a negative, or statistically insignificant, relationship. However, analysis at the city level finds a positive effect of diversity on wages and productivity. Generally there is a trade-off between the economic benefits of diversity and the costs of heterogeneity. Using cells of fixed size, we find that the relationship between diversity and growth is positive for small geographical areas. In the case of Africa, we argue that the explanation is the increase in trade at the boundaries between ethnic groups due to ethnic specialization.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00901

We find that increasing the complexity of the annuity choice reduces respondents' ability to value the annuity, measured by the difference between the sell and buy values they assign to the annuity. When we limit narrow choice bracketing by inducing people to think first about how quickly or slowly to spend down assets in retirement, their ability to value an annuity increases.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00892
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Race Between Deterrence and Displacement: Theory and Evidence from Bank Robberies,Vikram Maheshri and Giovanni Mastrobuoni,"Security measures that deter crime may unwittingly displace it to neighboring areas, but evidence of displacement is scarce. We exploit precise information on the timing and locations of all Italian bank robberies and security guard hirings over a decade to estimate deterrence and displacement effects of guards. A guard lowers the likelihood a bank is robbed by 35% to 40%. Over half of this reduction is displaced to nearby unguarded banks. Theory suggests optimal policy to mitigate this spillover is ambiguous. Our findings indicate restricting guards in sparse, rural markets and requiring guards in dense, urban markets could be socially beneficial.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00900

Among randomly assigned vendors in Kolkata, India, we find large improvements in knowledge and awareness but little change in observed behavior. We provide two main explanations for these findings. First, information acquisition by itself does not make it significantly easier for vendors to provide customers with safer food options. Second, although consumers have a positive willingness to pay for perceived hygiene, they struggle to distinguish between safe and contaminated food. We recommend policies targeting supply-side constraints and consumers' awareness.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00913
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Are Consumers' Spending Decisions in Line with A Euler Equation?,Lena Dräger and Giang Nghiem,"Evaluating a new survey of German consumers, we test whether individual consumption spending decisions are formed according to a Euler equation model. We find that consumers are more likely to increase current spending if they plan to increase spending in the future and if they expect higher inflation. In the subsample of financially literate households, we find an additional negative effect of nominal interest rate expectations. The effects of macroeconomic expectations become stronger if consumers observed news on monetary policy or financial markets. These news effects are particularly pronounced for consumers who save and those with low inflation forecast accuracy.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00909
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Treatment Effect Accounting for Network Changes,Margherita Comola and Silvia Prina,Networks may rewire in response to interventions. We propose a measure of the treatment effect when an intervention affects the structure of a social network. We develop a treatment-response model that incorporates dynamic peer effects and provide its identification conditions and the associated instrumental-variable strategy. We illustrate our estimation procedure using a panel data set containing information on a financial network before and after a field experiment that randomized access to savings accounts. Results show that neglecting the network change results in underestimation of the impact of the intervention and the role played by informal networks through which the intervention diffuses.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00908
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies with Wealth in the Utility Function,Pascal Michaillat and Emmanuel Saez,"At the zero lower bound, the New Keynesian model predicts that output and inflation collapse to implausibly low levels and that government spending and forward guidance have implausibly large effects. To resolve these anomalies, we introduce wealth into the utility function; the justification is that wealth is a marker of social status, and people value status. Since people partly save to accrue social status, the Euler equation is modified. As a result, when the marginal utility of wealth is sufficiently large, the dynamical system representing the zero-lower-bound equilibrium transforms from a saddle to a source, which resolves all the anomalies.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00893
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Revisions in Utilization-Adjusted TFP and Robust Identification of News Shocks,André Kurmann and Eric Sims,"This paper documents large revisions in a widely used series of utilization-adjusted total factor productivity (TFP) by Fernald (2014) and shows that these revisions can materially affect empirical results about the effects of news shocks. We trace these revisions to changes in estimated factor utilization that are evocative of cyclical measurement issues with productivity. We propose an alternative identification that is robust to these measurement issues. Applied to U.S. data, the shock predicts delayed productivity growth while simultaneously generating strong responses of novel indicators of technological innovation and forward-looking variables. The shock does not lead to comovement in macroeconomic aggregates.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00896

Evidence from a Field Experiment with Student Loan Borrowers,"Tatiana Homonoff, Rourke O'Brien and Abigail B. Sussman","One in five consumer credit accounts incurs late fees each quarter. Evidence on the efficacy of regulations to improve behavior through enhanced disclosure of financial product attributes is mixed. We test a novel form of disclosure that provides borrowers with a personalized measure of their creditworthiness. In a field experiment with over 400,000 student loan borrowers, treatment group members received communications about the availability of their FICO Score. The intervention significantly reduced late payments and increased borrowers' FICO Scores. Survey data show treatment group members were less likely to overestimate their FICO Scores, suggesting the intervention may correct for overoptimism.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00888
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Making the Grade: The Sensitivity of Education Program Effectiveness to Input Choices and Outcome Measures,Jason Kerwin and Rebecca Thornton,"This paper demonstrates the acute sensitivity of education program effectiveness to the choices of inputs and outcome measures, using a randomized evaluation of a mother-tongue literacy program. The program raises reading scores by 0.64 SD and writing scores by 0.45 SD. A reduced-cost version instead yields statistically insignificant reading gains and some large negative effects (−0.33 SDs) on advanced writing. We combine a conceptual model of education production with detailed classroom observations to examine the mechanisms driving the results; we show they could be driven by the program initially lowering productivity before raising it, and potentially by missing complementary inputs in the reduced-cost version.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00911

Exploiting task-based demand shifts as a shock to relative pay, I find that a higher relative wage (a) increases the quality of women's mates, as measured by higher spousal education; (b) reduces marriage without substitution to cohabitation; and (c) raises women's hours of work. These effects are consistent with a model in which a higher relative wage increases the minimum nonpecuniary benefits (“quality”) women require from a spouse and therefore reduce marriage among low-quality husbands.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00919

To address the concern that officer location is often driven by crime, my instrument exploits police responses to calls outside their allocated coverage beat. This variable provides a plausible shift in police presence within the abandoned beat that is driven by the police goal of minimizing response times. I find that a 10% decrease in police presence at that location results in a 7% increase in crime. This result sheds light on the black box of policing and crime and suggests that routine changes in police patrol can have a significant impact on criminal behavior.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00889
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Is Your Lawyer a Lemon? Incentives and Selection in the Public Provision of Criminal Defense,"Amanda Agan, Matthew Freedman and Emily Owens","Governments in the United States must offer free legal services to low-income people accused of crimes. To provide these services, many jurisdictions rely on assigned counsel systems, where private attorneys represent indigent defendants on a contract basis. These defendants are more likely to be convicted and incarcerated than defendants with privately retained attorneys. Using detailed court records, we investigate the mechanisms behind this disparity and consider their policy implications. We find that adverse selection among lawyers is not the primary contributor to the assigned counsel penalty. We conclude that reform efforts should address moral hazard in assigned counsel systems.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00891
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Contact versus Exposure: Refugee Presence and Voting for the Far Right,Andreas Steinmayr,"This paper investigates how different forms of exposure to refugees affect voting for Far Right parties. I study the state of Upper Austria where many municipalities hosted asylum seekers and also experienced a massive flow of refugees crossing into Germany in 2015. Exposure to refugees passing through border municipalities increased Far Right votes by about 1.5 percentage points, which suggests that mere exposure can increase Far Right support. Conversely, contact and sustained interactions between natives and asylum seekers in hosting municipalities decreased Far Right votes by about 4 percentage points, which is in line with the intergroup contact theory.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00922
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Estimation of Peer Effects in Endogenous Social Networks: Control Function Approach,Ida Johnsson and Hyungsik Roger Moon,"We propose methods of estimating the linear-in-means model of peer effects in which the peer group, defined by a social network, is endogenous in the outcome equation for peer effects. Endogeneity is due to unobservable individual characteristics that influence both link formation in the network and the outcome of interest. We propose two estimators of the peer effect equation that control for the endogeneity of the social connections using a control function approach. We leave the functional form of the control function unspecified, estimate the model using a sieve semiparametric approach and establish asymptotics of the semiparametric estimator.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00870
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Wild Bootstrap with a “Small” Number of “Large” Clusters,"Ivan Canay, Andres Santos and Azeem Shaikh","This paper studies the wild bootstrap–based test proposed in Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008). Existing analyses of its properties require that number of clusters is “large.” In an asymptotic framework in which the number of clusters is “small,” we provide conditions under which an unstudentized version of the test is valid. These conditions include homogeneity-like restrictions on the distribution of covariates. We further establish that a studentized version of the test may only overreject the null hypothesis by a “small” amount that decreases exponentially with the number of clusters. We obtain a qualitatively similar result for “score” bootstrap-based tests, which permit testing in nonlinear models.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00887
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Exporting Out of Agriculture: The Impact of WTO Accession on Structural Transformation in China,Bilge Erten and Jessica Leight,"This paper analyzes the effect of China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 on structural transformation at the local level, exploiting cross-sectional variation in tariff uncertainty faced by county economies pre-2001. Using a new panel of 1,800 Chinese counties from 1996 to 2013, we find that counties more exposed to the reduction in tariff uncertainty postaccession are characterized by increased exports and foreign direct investment, shrinking agricultural sectors, expanding secondary sectors, and higher total and per capita GDP. In addition, when labor substitutes from nonagricultural to agricultural production in counties exposed to positive trade shocks, agricultural output declines.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00852
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Labor Market Effects of Offshoring by U.S. Multinational Firms,"Brian Kovak, Lindsay Oldenski and Nicholas Sly","We use firm-level data on U.S. multinationals to show how offshoring affects domestic employment within and across firms. We introduce a new instrument for offshoring, bilateral tax treaties, which reduce the cost of offshore activities. We find substantial heterogeneity in effects. A 10% increase in affiliate employment drives a 1.3% increase in employment at the U.S. parent firm, with smaller effects at the industry and regional levels. In contrast, offshoring by vertical multinationals drives declining employment among nonmultinationals in the same industry, and firms opening new affiliates exhibit smaller domestic employment growth than those expanding existing affiliates.",https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00878
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,"Accountability, Political Capture, and Selection Into Politics: Evidence from Peruvian Municipalities","Miriam Artiles, Lukas Kleine-Rueschkamp and Gianmarco León-Ciliotta",We estimate the effects of political accountability on the selection of politicians when accountability mechanisms are prone to political capture. We compare the characteristics of candidates running in municipalities where the previous incumbent was ousted from office through a recall referendum with those who run where the recall referendum failed by a small margin. Having a recalled incumbent in the previous term causes a negative selection of candidates in terms of their education and previous experience. They are also less representative of indigenous groups. The results are driven by localities where the accountability institution is likely used for political purposes.,https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00906
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Slow Road from Serfdom: Labor Coercion and Long-Run Development in the Former Russian Empire,Johannes Buggle and Steven Nafziger,"This paper examines the long-run economic consequences of Russian serfdom. Employing data on the intensity of labor coercion just prior to emancipation in 1861, we document that a 25 percentage point increase in historical serfdom (1 SD) reduces household expenditure today by up to 17%. We then provide evidence on the persistence of this relationship by studying city populations over the period 1800 to 2002. Exploring mechanisms, our findings suggest that less urban agglomeration and slower industrial development in areas with a greater degree of serfdom perpetuated the negative effects of forced labor before, during, and after the Soviet period.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00857
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Effect of Social Connectedness on Crime: Evidence from the Great Migration,Bryan Stuart and Evan Taylor,"This paper estimates the effect of social connectedness on crime across U.S. cities from 1970 to 2009. Migration networks among African Americans from the South generated variation across destinations in the concentration of migrants from the same birth town. Using this novel source of variation, we find that social connectedness considerably reduces murders, rapes, robberies, assaults, burglaries, and motor vehicle thefts, with a 1 standard deviation increase in social connectedness reducing murders by 21% and motor vehicle thefts by 20%. Social connectedness especially reduces murders of adolescents and young adults committed during gang and drug activity.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00860

We exploit random assignment of cases to judges and use idiosyncratic judge stringency in imprisonment to estimate the causal effect of incarceration. We find that juvenile incarceration increases the propensity of being convicted for a drug offense in adulthood while it lowers the propensity to be convicted of a property crime. Juvenile incarceration has also a detrimental effect on high school completion for earlier cohorts, but it has no impact on later cohorts.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00872
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,"The Tyranny of the Single-Minded: Guns, Environment, and Abortion","Laurent Bouton, Paola Conconi, Francisco Pino and Maurizio Zanardi","We study how electoral incentives affect policy choices on secondary issues, which only minorities of voters care intensely about. We develop a model in which office and policy-motivated politicians vote in favor of or against regulations on these issues. We derive conditions under which politicians flip-flop, voting according to their policy preferences at the beginning of their terms but in line with the preferences of single-issue minorities as they approach reelection. To assess the evidence, we study U.S. senators' votes on gun control, the environment, and reproductive rights. In line with the model's predictions, we find that election proximity has a pro-gun effect on Democratic senators and a pro-environment effect on Republican senators; these effects arise for senators who are not retiring, do not hold safe seats, and represent states where the single-issue minority is of intermediate size. Also in line with our theory, election proximity does not affect votes on reproductive rights due to the presence of single-issue minorities on both sides.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00897
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Targeted Price Controls on Supermarket Products,Diego Aparicio and Alberto Cavallo,"We study the impact of targeted price controls on supermarket products in Argentina. Using daily prices for controlled and noncontrolled goods, we examine the effects on inflation, product availability, entry and exit, and price dispersion. First, price controls have only a small and temporary effect on inflation that reverses soon after the controls are lifted. Second, contrary to common belief, controlled goods are consistently available for sale. Third, firms respond by introducing new varieties at higher prices. Overall, our results show that targeted price controls are just as ineffective as more traditional policies of price controls in reducing aggregate inflation.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00880
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,An Engel Curve for Variety,Nicholas Li,"I examine the source and welfare implications of differences in household consumption diversity. I document the existence of a positive correlation between household variety and expenditure to motivate a simple framework where households purchase more varieties to counteract diminishing returns to quantity but face location-specific costs of accessing variety. Estimating the model with Indian household data, I find that the increase in dietary diversity between 1983 and 2009 was mostly due to lower costs of accessing variety, which resulted in large welfare gains. Urban households also benefit from a lower cost of accessing varieties than rural households.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00879
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Price Effects of Nonprofit College and University Mergers,Lauren Russell,"Nonprofit colleges and universities have merged across the United States citing economies of scale and scope. Yet whether these mergers raise prices has not been empirically assessed. Using a retrospective merger evaluation approach, I estimate that the average merger between 2000 and 2015 increased tuition and fees by 5% to 7% relative to nonmerging institutions in the same state and sector (public or nonprofit). Effects on net prices are estimated imprecisely, but the results are suggestive that nonprofit colleges use mergers to increase price discrimination.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00874
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Choice Architecture to Improve Financial Decision Making,"Jeffrey Carpenter, Emiliano Huet-Vaughn, Peter Matthews, Andrea Robbett, Dustin Beckett and Julian Jamison","We exploit the principles of choice architecture to evaluate interventions in the market for reloadable prepaid cards. Participants are randomized into three card menu presentation treatments—the market status quo, a regulation-inspired reform, or an enhanced reform designed to minimize attribute overload—and offered choices based on prior structural estimation of individual preferences. Consumers routinely choose incorrectly under the status quo, with tentative evidence that the regulation-inspired presentation may increase best card choice and clear evidence that the enhanced reform reduces worst card choice. Welfare analysis suggests the regulation-inspired presentation offers modest gains, while the enhanced policy generates substantial benefits.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00881
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Credit Constraints and the Measurement of Time Preferences,Mark Dean and Anja Sautmann,"Incentivized experiments are often used to identify the time preferences of households in developing countries. We argue theoretically and empirically that experimental measures may not identify preference parameters, but are a useful tool for understanding financial shocks and constraints. Using data from an experiment in Mali, we find that subject responses vary with savings and financial shocks, meaning they provide information about credit constraints and can be used to test models of risk sharing.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00903
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,Multiple Switching and Data Quality in the Multiple Price List,"Chi Wai Yu, Y. Jane Zhang and Sharon Xuejing Zuo","A substantial proportion of individuals who complete the widely used multiple price list (MPL) instrument switch back and forth between the safe and the risky choice columns, behavior that is believed to indicate low-quality decision making. We develop a conceptual framework to formally define decision-making quality, test explanations for the nature of low-quality decision making, and introduce a novel “nudge” treatment that reduced multiple switching behavior and increased decision-making quality. We find evidence in support of task-specific miscomprehension of the MPL and that non-multiple switchers and relatively high-cognitive-ability individuals are not immune to low-quality decision making.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00895

Tam","Using administrative tax records for U.K. businesses, we document both bunching in annual turnover below the VAT registration threshold and persistent voluntary registration by almost half of the firms below the threshold. We develop a conceptual framework that can simultaneously explain these two apparently conflicting facts. The framework also predicts that higher intermediate input shares, lower product-market competition, and a lower share of business to consumer sales lead to voluntary registration. The predictions are exactly the opposite for bunching. We test the theory using linked VAT and corporation tax records from 2004 to 2014, finding empirical support for these predictions.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00884

Identification is based on variation in light conditions induced by differences in sunrise and sunset times across space and time. We estimate that darkness causes annual costs of more than £500 million in Great Britain. By setting daylight saving time year-round, 8% of these costs could be saved. Thus, focusing solely on the short-run costs related to the transition itself underestimates the total costs of the current time regime.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00873
The Review of Economics and Statistics,2021,The Impact of Immigration on Firm-Level Offshoring,William Olney and Dario Pozzoli,"This paper studies the relationship between immigration and offshoring by examining whether an influx of foreign workers reduces the need for firms to relocate jobs abroad. Using a Danish natural experiment and their employer-employee matched data set covering the universe of workers and firms (1995–2011), our findings show that an exogenous influx of immigrants into a municipality reduces firm-level offshoring at both the extensive and intensive margins. While the multilateral relationship is negative, a subsequent bilateral analysis shows that immigrants have connections in their country of origin that increase the likelihood that firms offshore to that particular foreign country.",http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest_a_00861
