Journal of European Economic Association,2025,Contracting for Coordination,Marina Halac,"A principal contracts with agents to achieve coordination. Multiple equilibria can in general arise under given contract offers, and the principal wishes to maximize her payoff guarantee across equilibrium outcomes. I discuss recent work on contracting for coordination using a simple, unifying framework. The analysis reveals how the principal’s concern for strategic uncertainty shapes optimal contracts, with implications for discrimination and inequality between agents. I adapt the framework to various settings—including contractible actions, hidden actions, and hidden information—and highlight the relevance of contracting for coordination in applications—including adoption and investment, team incentives, and goods with network externalities.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvaf015
Journal of European Economic Association,2025,Economic Growth in a Cooperative Economy,Thomas Brzustowski and Francesco Caselli,"We develop and formalise an equilibrium concept for a dynamic economy in which production takes place in worker cooperatives. The concept rules out allocations of workers to cooperatives in which a worker in one cooperative could move to a different cooperative and make both herself and the existing workers in the receiving cooperative better off. It also rules out allocations in which workers in a cooperative would be made better off by some of the other workers leaving. We also provide a minimum-information equilibrium-selection criterion, which refines our equilibrium concept. We illustrate the application of our concept and refinement in the context of an overlapping-generation economy with specific preferences and technology. The cooperative economy follows a dynamic path qualitatively similar to the path followed by a capitalist economy, featuring gradual convergence to a steady state with constant output. However, the cooperative economy features a static inefficiency, in that, for a given aggregate capital stock, firm size is smaller than what a social planner would choose. On the other hand, the cooperative economy cannot be dynamically inefficient and could accumulate capital at a rate that is higher or lower than the capitalist economy. As a result, steady-state income per worker could be higher or lower in the cooperative economy. We also present an illustrative calibration, which quantitatively compares steady-state incomes and welfare in a cooperative and in a capitalist economy.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae050
Journal of European Economic Association,2025,A Simple Theory of Deep Trade Integration,Mathieu Parenti and Gonzague Vannoorenberghe,"Which countries should aim for regulatory cooperation, and to what extent should they pursue it? We develop an imperfectly competitive trade model that accounts for differences in technology and regulatory preferences regarding local consumption externalities across countries. Each country sets unique product standards, and firms incur costs when tailoring products to different markets. Trade occurs when the benefits of comparative advantages outweigh the desire for asymmetric regulations. Our findings indicate that regulatory cooperation, defined as the cooperative setting of standards, is most advantageous for countries with moderate differences in regulatory preferences. Shallow integration, however, falls short of achieving the optimal planner’s solution. Countries with strong comparative advantages in distinct externality-generating goods can pursue deeper regulatory cooperation through mutual regulatory concessions. Additionally, when regulatory preferences are highly dispersed, international cooperation tends to form regulatory blocs.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae046

We collected data on more than 2000 such migrants and compared the well-being of those who arrived in Colombia before and after the date that defined program eligibility. Since this date was announced ex-post and was unknown to the public, we could credibly evaluate the program’s impact. We find that program beneficiaries experienced large improvements in well-being, including consumption per capita (a gain of 48%), monthly labor income (an increase of 22%), and health status (an increment of 1.2 standard deviations). These positive outcomes largely stemmed from improved access to services, particularly the social protection system, subsidized healthcare system, and financial services. We also find that the fiscal costs incurred by the Colombian government for a regularized migrant household are lower than those for an irregular migrant household.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae044
Journal of European Economic Association,2025,False Narratives and Political Mobilization,"Kfir Eliaz, Simone Galperti and Ran Spiegler","We present an equilibrium model of politics in which political platforms compete over public opinion. A platform consists of a policy, a coalition of social groups with diverse intrinsic attitudes to policies, and a narrative. We conceptualize narratives as subjective models that attribute a commonly valued outcome to (potentially spurious) postulated causes. When quantified against empirical observations, these models generate a shared belief among coalition members over the outcome as a function of its postulated causes. The intensity of this belief and the members’ intrinsic attitudes to the platform’s policy determine the extent to which the coalition is mobilized. Only platforms that generate maximal mobilization prevail in equilibrium. Our equilibrium characterization demonstrates how false narratives can be detrimental to the commonly valued outcome, and how political fragmentation leads to their proliferation. The false narratives that emerge in equilibrium have a flavor of “scapegoating:” They attribute good outcomes to the exclusion of social groups from ruling coalitions.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae047

I study this question in a model in which households value the liquidity services of deposits yet do not accept negative deposit rates. When deposit rates are constrained by the ZLB, tight capital requirements disproportionately hurt franchise values and are therefore less effective in curbing excessive risk taking. The model delivers a novel rationale for “interest-dependent” capital regulation that is optimally laxer when the ZLB binds and tighter when the ZLB is slack but may bind in the future.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae048

This paper uses administrative data for the population of Norway to examine the share of the Total Inflows (defined as the capitalized sum of net labor income, government transfers, and gifts and inheritances received over the period) accounted for by capitalized gifts and inheritances. Consistent with other work, we find that there is much inequality in the receipt of gifts and inheritances. However, gifts and inheritances represent a small share of Total Inflows; this is true across the distribution of Total Inflows, as well as at all levels of net wealth. Gifts and inheritances are only an important source of income flows among those who have very wealthy parents. Additionally, gifts and inheritances have very little effect on the distribution of Total Inflows, suggesting that inheritance taxes may do little to mitigate inequality.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae056

The theory predicts a pricing rule that is similar to—but crucially different from—that of a standard menu-cost theory: There is an inaction band, but there are two rather than just one target prices, depending on whether the firm updates its price upwards or downwards. The calibrated model replicates two patterns of price microdata that standard menu-cost models have difficulty accounting for: (i) the distribution of price changes has both small and large price changes and (ii) the hazard function of price changes is downward sloping initially, that is, firms that have just recently changed their price have a higher probability of changing it again, while this probability becomes constant thereafter.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae049

In an RCT in Germany with highly subsidized child care (), we offer treated families information and personal assistance for applications. We find substantial, equity-enhancing effects of the treatment, closing half of the large SES gap in child care enrollment. Increased enrollment for lower-SES families is likely driven by altered application knowledge and behavior.

Journal of European Economic Association,2025,SME Failures Under Large Liquidity Shocks: an Application to the Covid-19 Crisis,"Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan, Veronika Penciakova and Nick Sander","We study the effects of financial frictions on firm exit when firms face large liquidity shocks. We develop a simple model of firm cost-minimization, where firms’ borrowing capacity to smooth temporary shocks to liquidity is limited. In this framework, firm exit arises from the interaction between this financial friction and fluctuations in cash flow due to aggregate and sectoral changes in demand conditions, as well as more traditional shocks to productivity. To evaluate the implications of our model, we use firm level data on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in 11 European countries. We confirm that our framework is consistent with official failure rates in 2017–2019, a period characterized by standard business cycle fluctuations. To capture a large liquidity shock, we apply our framework to the COVID-19 crisis. We find that, absent government support, SME failure rates would have increased by 6.01 percentage points, putting 3.1% of employment at risk. Our results also show that in the presence of financial frictions and in the absence of government support, the firms failing due to COVID have similar productivity and growth to firms that survive COVID.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae041

If parents invest resources to educate their children, then raising fertility for strategic reasons might be at the cost of future human capital. We dispel this view using census data from several developing countries. We show that religious and ethnic minorities in Indonesia, China, and Malaysia tend to invest more in both education and fertility compared to larger groups. Solving for the Nash equilibrium of an appropriation game between two groups with education and fertility being prescribed as group-specific behavioral norms, we offer a rationale for the observed patterns provided that human capital is an important input to appropriation.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae027

Such thresholds imply selling stocks at the maximum price since purchase. We use a large discount brokerage dataset containing US households’ trading records between 1991 and 1996 to document that in 31.6% of cases the stocks sold for a gain are sold on the day when the maximum since purchase occurs. However, not all stocks are sold at a maximum since purchase and the propensity to sell changes depending on how far in time and price the stock is with respect to this past maximum. We find that the propensity to sell initially increases as the price is closer to the past maximum but it then decreases when the price gets in the closest region to the past maximum, leading to an inverse U-shape; and that investors are less likely to sell a gain, the further away in time the maximum price occurred. Studying the joint effect of price and time distance, we find that the propensity to sell is highest at low time distance and high price distance from the maximum since purchase.

Journal of European Economic Association,2025,"Social Capital, Government Expenditures, and Growth",Giacomo A M Ponzetto and Ugo Antonio Troiano,"This paper shows that social capital increases economic growth by raising government investment in human capital through better political incentives and selection. We provide empirical evidence that a greater share of output is spent on public education where social capital is higher, both across countries and across U.S. states. We develop a theoretical model of stochastic endogenous growth with imperfect political agency. Only some people correctly anticipate the future returns to current spending on public education. Greater social diffusion of information makes this knowledge more widespread among voters. As a result, social capital alleviates myopic political incentives to underinvest in human capital. It also helps voters select politicians who ensure high productivity in public education. Through this mechanism, we show that social capital raises the equilibrium growth rate of output and reduces its volatility.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae043

Potential employers face uncertainty regarding an individual’s productive value. Knowing which school an individual went to is useful for two reasons: firstly, average students’ ability may differ across schools; secondly, different schools may use different grading rules and thus provide varying incentives to exert effort.

Journal of European Economic Association,2025,Das House Kapital: A Long-Run Theory of House Prices and Housing Wealth,"Volker Grossmann, Benjamin Larin and Thomas Steger","Over the last 70 years, many advanced countries have experienced growing real house prices and an increasing housing wealth-to-income ratio. To explain these long-run patterns, this paper introduces a novel multi-sector growth model where housing services are produced using non-reproducible land and reproducible structures. Land is also employed in the non-housing sector. First, we identify two fundamental mechanisms driving the long-run increase in the real house price: (i) technological progress in the construction sector lags behind the technological progress of the rest of the economy and (ii) housing production is more land-intensive than non-housing production. Second, we study transitional dynamics for the US, UK, France, and Germany. Our calibrated model explains most of the observed increase in the housing wealth-to-income ratio since 1950. Counterfactual experiments identify initially low stocks of residential structures and non-residential capital as key exogenous drivers for this increase. The associated investment incentives led to a long-lasting construction boom and steadily increasing land scarcity, boosting residential land prices.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae038

Journal of European Economic Association,2025,Testing Models of Strategic Uncertainty: Equilibrium Selection in Repeated Games,"Marta Boczoń, Emanuel Vespa, Taylor Weidman and Alistair Wilson","In repeated games, where both collusive and non-collusive outcomes can be supported as equilibria, it is crucial to understand the likelihood of selection for each type of equilibrium. Controlled experiments have empirically validated a selection criterion for the two-player repeated prisoner’s dilemma: the basin of attraction for always defect. This prediction device uses the game primitives to measure the set of beliefs for which an agent would prefer to unconditionally defect rather than attempt conditional cooperation. This belief measure reflects strategic uncertainty over others’ actions, where the prediction is for non-cooperative outcomes when the basin measure is full, and cooperative outcomes when empty. We expand this selection notion to multi-player social dilemmas and experimentally test the predictions, manipulating both the total number of players and the payoff tensions. Our results affirm the model as a tool for predicting long-term cooperation while also speaking to some limitations when dealing with first-time encounters.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae042
Journal of European Economic Association,2025,FBBA Lecture 2024: The Uncharted Waters of International Trade,Pol Antràs,"The field of international trade has undergone significant theoretical and empirical advancements over the last 25 years. A key breakthrough has been the emergence of firm-level approaches to studying exporting, importing, and global value chains. The field has also experienced a quantitative revolution, driven by medium-scale models that rapidly assess the implications of trade cost shocks on real income. Additionally, a branch of the empirical literature has unshackled itself from the discipline of theoretical frameworks and from traditional data sources. Yet, several underexplored areas, or “uncharted waters,” remain in international trade research. I outline new potential areas for theoretical research, including incorporating oligopolistic (strategic) behavior into core models, and fostering greater cross-disciplinary collaboration with other fields in economics and social sciences, such as behavioral economics or political science. I also discuss potential uncharted waters for empirical trade economists, while identifying potential new sources of data and ways in which official trade statistics could be improved.

Journal of European Economic Association,2025,Presidential Address 2024: The Value and Profits of Firms,Jan Eeckhout,"The real growth of the stock market value of firms has increased from close to 0% on average per year between 1958 and 1980, to 5.2% between 1980 and today. This change coincides with the rise of market power and profits, starting in 1980. This paper proposes to decompose the value of firms based on profits (earnings) rather than dividends. Because firms on average pay out only half of profits in dividends, dividends poorly measure firm performance. I decompose the sources of the rise of the value of all publicly traded firms into the following categories: (1) the subjective and risk-free discount factor, (2) expected future profits, and (3) shareholder equity (retained earnings). I find that 20% of the rise is due to the discount factor and 80% is due to profits (45% current and future expected profits; 35% retained earnings). I build a general equilibrium model of the economy where firms have market power; I perform counterfactuals and evaluate the welfare implications. The objective is to study the impact of competition policy. If market power today dropped to the level of 1980, average stock market values would be 45% lower. Instead, if market power had never increased in 1980, the average stock values would be 80% lower.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jeea/jvae061

The reform raised minimum instruction time in less-developed rural areas and boosted the resources available to rural schools, reducing class size, and raising teacher salaries. We show that cohorts more intensively affected by the reform increased their education and experienced higher labor income. Our main result is that the schooling reform also boosted support for the Norwegian Labour Party in subsequent elections. This additional support persisted for several decades and was pivotal in maintaining support for the social democratic coalition in Norway. These results are not driven by the direct impact of education and are not explained by higher turnout, or greater attention or resources from the Labour Party targeted toward the municipalities most affected by the reform.

Journal of European Economic Association,2025,Labor Unions and the Electoral Consequences of Trade Liberalization,"Pedro Ogeda, Emanuel Ornelas and Rodrigo Soares","We show that the Brazilian trade liberalization in the early 1990s led to a permanent relative decline in the vote share of left-wing presidential candidates in the regions more affected by the tariff cuts. This happened even though the shock, implemented by a right-wing party, induced a contraction in manufacturing and formal employment in the more affected regions, and despite the left’s identification with protectionist policies. To rationalize this response, we consider a new institutional channel for the political effects of trade shocks: the weakening of labor unions. We provide support for this mechanism in two steps. First, we show that union presence—proxied by the number of workers directly employed by unions, by union density, and by the number of union establishments—declined in regions that became more exposed to foreign competition. Second, we show that the negative effect of tariff reductions on the votes for the left was driven exclusively by political parties with historical links to unions. Furthermore, the impact of the trade liberalization on the vote share of these parties was significant only in regions that had unions operating before the reform. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that tariff cuts reduced the vote share of the left partly through the weakening of labor unions.
