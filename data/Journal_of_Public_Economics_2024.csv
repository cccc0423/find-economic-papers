Journal of Public Economics,2024,Who truly bears (bank) taxes? Evidence from only shifting statutory incidence,"Gabriel Jiménez, David Martinez-Miera and José-Luis Peydró","We analyze the effects of only shifting the statutory incidence of taxes by exploiting: (i) a mortgage tax shift from being levied on borrowers to being levied on banks, without tax rate changes; (ii) some areas –for historical reasons– being tax-exempt (or having different tax rates); and (iii) administrative data. After the shift, the average mortgage rate increases, less for households with more banking opportunities or with higher income. The tax pass-through is nonexistent for high-income households, but complete for low-income households. Consistently, banks’ risk-taking increases, especially by more policy-affected banks. Results are consistent with a model in which all borrowers have tax saliency issues and differ in their bargaining power vis-à-vis the lender. Overall, the evidence is inconsistent with the irrelevance of statutory incidence and suggests unintended consequences on inequality and banks’ risk-taking.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001099
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Laffer’s day in court: The revenue effects of criminal justice fees and fines,Samuel Norris and Evan K. Rose,"Many jurisdictions levy sizable fines and fees (legal financial obligations, or LFOs) on criminal defendants. Proponents argue LFOs are a “tax on crime” that funds courts and provides deterrence; opponents argue they do neither. We examine the fiscal implications of lowering LFOs. Incentives to default generate a “Laffer” curve with revenue eventually decreasing in LFOs. Using detailed administrative data, however, we find few defendants demonstrably on the right-hand side of the curve. Those who are tend to be poor, Black, and charged with felonies. As a result, decreasing LFOs for the average defendant would come at substantial cost to governments.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001853
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Misperceived effectiveness and the demand for psychotherapy,"Christopher Roth, Peter Schwardmann and Egon Tripodi","While psychotherapy has been shown to be effective in treating depression, take-up remains low. In a sample of 1843 depressed individuals, we document that effectiveness concerns are top of mind when respondents consider the value of therapy. We then show that the average respondent underestimates the effectiveness of therapy. An information treatment correcting this misperception increases participants’ incentivized willingness to pay for a $320 therapy from $166 to $176. Our evidence suggests that while information can influence therapy demand by altering beliefs and shifting attention, it may not significantly increase demand unless substantial subsidies are provided.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001907
Journal of Public Economics,2024,From viewers to voters: Tracing Fox News’ impact on American democracy,"Elliott Ash, Sergio Galletta, Matteo Pinna and Christopher S. Warshaw","This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the effect of Fox News Channel (FNC) on the mass public’s political preferences and voting behavior in the United States from 2000 to 2020. We show that FNC has shifted the ideology and partisan identity of Americans rightward. This shift has helped Republican candidates in elections across levels of U.S. government over the past decade. Our estimates suggests that an increase of 0.05 rating points in Fox News viewership, induced by exogenous changes in channel placement, has increased Republican vote shares by at least 0.5 percentage points in recent presidential, Senate, House, and gubernatorial elections.

To measure social capital, we employ a novel, fine-grained indicator based on Italy’s 5 per Mille provision, which allows taxpayers to allocate a portion of their income tax to non-profit organizations. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that city council dismissals lead to a significant increase in social capital.

Using a novel dataset that combines census information on the universe of Indian firms with geo-referenced data on SEZs, we find that the establishment of SEZs increased local manufacturing and service employment, with positive spillovers up to 10 km from the SEZ area. The analysis shows that the gains in manufacturing and service employment were accompanied by a decline in agricultural labor, especially for women, suggesting that the policy contributed to structural change. In further analysis, we document that significant local employment effects occur across different types of SEZs: privately and publicly run zones, and SEZs with different industry designations.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001956

However, little is known about the scale at which neighborhood effects operate, and thus what it is about neighborhoods that matters. By using the quasi-random assignment of public housing along with administrative data from Denmark, we get inside the “black box” of neighborhood effects by defining neighborhoods using various characteristics and scales.

We study the introduction of a new program, P-EBT, that provided grocery vouchers worth approximately $300 per student during spring and summer 2020. Using cross-state variation in program timing, we find that families spent $18–42 per student per week in the 6 weeks after benefit receipt.

Pollakowski, Matthew Staiger and Daniel Weinberg","We combine national administrative data on earnings and participation in subsidized housing to investigate how the demolition of 160 public housing projects—funded by the HOPE VI Demolition program—affected adult labor market outcomes for 18,500 children. Our empirical strategy compares children exposed to the program between ages 10 and 18 to children drawn from thousands of non-demolished projects, adjusting for observable differences using a flexible estimator that combines features of matching and regression. We find that children who resided in HOPE VI projects earn 15 percent more at age 26 relative to children in comparison projects. Earnings gains are greatest for demolitions in high-poverty neighborhoods in large cities, the context for most prior research on HOPE VI. However, most HOPE VI projects were in smaller cities where we find weaker effects that are not statistically significant. We investigate pathways including improved parental earnings, childhood exposure to lower poverty neighborhoods, and greater job accessibility. We find the strongest evidence for improved job accessibility facilitating increased employment and earnings for young adults.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001245
Journal of Public Economics,2024,How does parental divorce affect children’s long-term outcomes?,"Wolfgang Frimmel, Martin Halla and Rudolf Winter-Ebmer","Many papers report a negative association between parental divorce and child outcomes. To provide evidence whether this correlation is causal, we exploit idiosyncratic variation in the extent of gender balance in fathers’ workplaces. Fathers who encounter more women in their relevant age–occupation–group at work are more likely to divorce. This result is conditional on the overall proportion of female employees in a firm and on detailed industry affiliation. Parental divorce has persistent, and mostly negative effects on children that differ between boys and girls. Treated boys have lower levels of educational attainment, worse labor market outcomes and are more likely to die early. Treated girls also have lower levels of educational attainment, but they are also more likely to have children at an early age (especially in their teens). However, treated girls lose less in terms of employment. This could be a direct consequence of teenage motherhood, which initiates early entry into the labor market.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001373
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Willingness to pay for crime reduction: The role of information in the Americas,Patricio Domínguez and Carlos Scartascini,"Crime levels are a perennial development problem in Latin America and a renewed concern in the United States. At the same time, trust in the police has been falling, and questions abound about citizens’ willingness to support government efforts to fight crime. We conduct a survey experiment to elicit willingness to contribute toward reducing crime across five Latin American countries and the United States. We compare homicide, robbery, and theft estimates and find a higher willingness to contribute to more severe crimes and for higher crime reductions. In addition, we examine the role of information on the willingness to contribute by conducting two experiments. While we document an 11 percent gap in willingness to pay for crime reduction between people who under and over-estimate the murder rate, we find that this gap can be wholly eliminated by informing respondents about the actual level of crime. We also show that exposing respondents to crime-related news increases their willingness to pay by 5 percent. On average, our estimates suggest that households are willing to contribute around $152 per year for a 20 percent reduction in homicide, representing an increase in security spending between 15 and 65 percent in Latin American countries (up to 0.5 percent of GDP).",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001415
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Intrahousehold inequality and the joint taxation of household earnings,"Cassiano B. Alves, Carlos E. da Costa, Felipe Lobel and Humberto Moreira","We derive the optimal joint-income tax schedule for couples, focusing on the distinction between interpersonal and inter-household inequality. Households are composed of two spouses with possibly unequal access to the family’s economic resources. Individual-oriented utilitarianism typically leads to a misalignment between the households’ and the government’s objectives, a phenomenon termed dissonance by Apps and Rees (1988). The traditional ABC formula must be amended by including a Pigouvian term to correct for dissonance. Under general conditions, the effect of dissonance on marginal taxes is ambiguous; its sign depends on whether the less powerful spouse’s marginal contribution to household earnings is less than, or greater than, her marginal entitlement to household consumption. Assuming identical iso-elastic preferences, the multidimensional heterogeneity collapses into a single-dimensional index, preserving the single-crossing property. This simplification enables us to solve (Mirrlees, 1971)’s multidimensional program and quantitatively assess the size and sign of the Pigouvian term, which is positive across all income levels, leading to higher marginal tax rates.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001440
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Payroll tax incidence: Evidence from unemployment insurance,Audrey Guo,"Economic models assume that payroll tax burdens fall fully on workers, but where does tax incidence fall when taxes are firm-specific and time-varying? Unemployment insurance in the United States has the key feature of varying both across employers and over time, creating the potential for labor demand responses if tax costs cannot be fully passed through to worker wages. Using state policy changes and administrative data of matched employer–employee job spells, I study how employment and earnings respond to unexpected payroll tax increases for highly exposed employers. I find significant drops in employment growth driven by lower hiring, and minimal evidence of pass-through to earnings. The negative employment effects are strongest for young workers and single-establishment firms.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001452
Journal of Public Economics,2024,How fiscally autonomous are local governments? An empirical test,Nicola Mauri,"How freely can local jurisdictions change their taxes and spending? I propose an empirical test of the effective degree of municipal fiscal autonomy by studying fiscal adjustments to a permanent exogenous revenue shift. Based on a tax competition model where jurisdictions are partially expenditure constrained, I derive a testable prediction: tax cuts from a small positive revenue shock will be larger (smaller) with higher perceived tax base mobility, if the local policymaker is strongly (weakly) fiscally constrained. I apply this test using a revenue shock generated by a reform in an inter-municipal transfer system within a Swiss canton. tax base mobility is proxied by the availability of zoned land reserves. I find that higher residential land availability is associated with stronger tax rate responses, but I find no statistically significant results for industrial land reserves. In light of the theory, this suggests that the effective degree of fiscal autonomy of local jurisdictions is low. Usual indicators of fiscal decentralization based on public accounts might overestimate the actual autonomy of local governments.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001464

Using longitudinal Swedish administrative data, I proxy women’s economic empowerment with a measure of potential relative earnings of married spouses caused by local changes in gender-specific labour demand. The findings reveal that an increase in potential relative earnings increases the probability of women’s hospital visits for injuries caused by assault, and the effect is particularly pronounced for women with low baseline bargaining power. Furthermore, exploiting detailed information on type of hospital visit, diagnosis and medical actions taken at the hospital, I show that the increase in hospital visits for assault is, at least in part, driven by an increase in care-seeking for IPV-related injuries rather than an increase in IPV itself.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001476

A random sample of household members received information about their household’s position in the income distribution. When provided with information directly, there are no gender differences in how individuals update their beliefs.

In a purely analytical Baseline model with tight borrowing constraints on students, which leads to a no-trade equilibrium without savings, the government pays for education via transfers to students or – equivalently – via grants to universities. The social welfare-maximising policy features generous education subsidies and highly progressive labour taxes, much more so than currently seen in the US or Europe, and results in an average consumption-equivalent gain of 8%.

That is, policymakers can use stimulus payments to substitute for conventional monetary policy when, say, the zero lower bound on short-term rates binds. We argue that in the same class of models, temporarily reducing consumption taxes delivers more stimulus than transfers — at the same cost to the taxpayer. Consumption tax cuts activate both income and substitution channels and prompt a strong response from all consumers across the wealth distribution.

Under such conditions, public capital investment with long-term rewards – despite its central role in the process of sustained economic development – may be neglected. In the context of India’s rural road construction programme, this study evaluates the role which large-scale public infrastructure initiatives have on the electoral accountability mechanism. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design with newly-digitised village-level voting outcomes from the 2014 general election, the results provide evidence of electoral support attributed to the political alliance which spearheaded the programme.

We leverage this update in monitoring technology for select votes to identify the impact of monitoring on politicians’ attendance within a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences methodology. Relying on video recordings of all sessions of the 49th Upper House legislature (2011–2015), we determine pre- and post-reform attendance rates during all votes and compare the change in attendance between votes affected and unaffected by the reform.

These decisions are strongly interrelated: Firms that increased prices relatively more often also showed a less negative employment response.

Journal of Public Economics,2024,The unintended consequences of merit-based teacher selection: Evidence from a large-scale reform in Colombia,"Matias Busso, Sebastián Montaño, Juan Munoz-Morales and Nolan G. Pope","Teacher quality is a key factor in improving student academic achievement. As such, educational policymakers strive to design systems to hire the most effective teachers. This paper examines the effects of a national policy reform in Colombia that established a merit-based teacher-hiring system intended to enhance teacher quality and improve student learning. Implemented in 2005 for all public schools, the policy ties teacher-hiring decisions to candidates’ performance on an exam evaluating subject-specific knowledge and teaching aptitude. The implementation of the policy led to many experienced contract teachers being replaced by high exam-performing novice teachers. We find that though the policy sharply increased pre-college test scores of teachers, it also decreased the overall stock of teacher experience and led to sharp decreases in students’ exam performance and educational attainment. Using a difference-in-differences strategy to compare the outcomes of students from public and private schools over two decades, we show that the hiring reform decreased students’ performance on high school exit exams by 8 percent of a standard deviation, and reduced the likelihood that students enroll in and graduate from college by more than 10 percent. The results underscore that relying exclusively on specific ex ante measures of teacher quality to screen candidates, particularly at the expense of teacher experience, may unintentionally reduce students’ learning gains.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001749

Workers in occupations whose services are in high (low) demand by the government favor high (low) taxes.

The reason is that equilibrium tax rates always reward excessive entry into the politically most powerful sector, and thus the equilibrium size of government is always either too big or too small.

Event study estimates show that this adverse effect persists in the medium run. Furthermore, we find a more salient effect for firms more likely to be financially constrained or subject to a higher labor market rigidity in firing workers.

The transfer had no short-term effects but caused sizable negative medium-term effects on household labor supply. In the medium run, population estimates indicate that for every extra 100 dollars in monthly child benefit transfers households received, they reduced their after-tax earnings by 25 dollars, spent 32 dollars on consumption, and saved 43 dollars. These negative labor supply effects are much larger and much more precisely estimated among households with low socioeconomic status. Additional evidence shows that the program had a positive impact on investments in human capital and home production efficiency.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001841
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Uneven recessions and optimal firm subsidies,Caio Machado,"How should policymakers distribute firm subsidies when supply shocks hit some firms and spill over to others through demand externalities? I propose a model to answer that question. The optimal policy depends on the severity of the supply shock and the degree of substitution across goods. If shocks are not too large or widespread, it is optimal to subsidize only firms not hit by supply shocks. For larger and more widespread shocks, the results depend on the elasticity of substitution: If complementarities across the varieties produced by firms are high, firms facing supply shocks should be prioritized, and the opposite is true if complementarities are low.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001865
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Effect of a transfer shock on subnational debt: Micro evidence from Mexico,Mariela Dal Borgo,"This paper examines how a shock to the distribution of federal transfers to Mexican municipalities affects their demand for long-term loans aimed at funding productive investments. Transfers are municipalities’ main source of debt payment and collateral. Using granular supervisory data, I find a positive effect on municipalities’ loan volume, normalized by the country’s total municipal loans, driven by obligations with private lenders. However, I find little or no average effect on take-up — despite many governments being unbanked —, repayment, or volume at the intensive margin. Governments with lower payment capacity and other preexisting debt are more sensitive to the shock. In particular, those with short-term debt are more likely to start borrowing from private lenders, while those with bonds turn to the development bank. The additional revenue mostly funds current rather than capital expenditures. These findings highlight that the policy goal of deepening subnational credit markets in developing countries must also address weaknesses in local investment capacities.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001877
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Targeted regulation for reducing high-ozone events,Christopher Holt and Joshua Linn,"Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are a precursor to ground-level ozone, a pernicious pollutant that is harmful to human health and ecosystems. Despite decades of regulations and a precipitous decline in NOx emissions, episodic high-ozone events prevent many areas from attaining air quality standards. Theoretically, spatially or temporally differentiated emissions prices could be more cost effective at reducing such events than a uniform price. To test this prediction, with data from EPA and NOAA spanning 2001–2019, we use novel empirical strategies to estimate (1) the link between hourly emissions and high-ozone events and (2) hourly marginal abatement costs. These estimates form the basis for simulations that compare uniform and differentiated emissions pricing. Consistent with economic theory, differentiated pricing is substantially more cost effective at reducing high-ozone events, though this advantage depends on the accuracy of the estimated NOx–ozone relationship. A daytime-only emissions price can achieve the same ozone-event reductions as a uniform emissions price at 42 percent lower cost; an emissions price that varies by power plant and hour of the day can achieve the same reductions at 88 percent lower cost.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001889

We exploit a sudden, large and long-lasting shock in the form of job loss and trace out its impact on individual political outcomes for up to 10 years after the event. The availability of detailed information on individuals before and after the job loss event allows us to reweight a comparison group to closely mimic the job losers in terms of their observable characteristics, pre-existing political support and voting behaviour. We find consistent and long-lasting effects on support and votes for the incumbent party, and shorter-lived effects on political engagement. We find limited impact on the support for fringe or populist parties. In the context of Brexit, opposition to the EU was much higher amongst those who lost their jobs, but this was largely due to pre-existing differences which were not exacerbated by the job loss event itself.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001890

While much literature examines charter school spillover effects and the effects of specialized schools on the students who attend them, little is known about the spillover effects of specialized high schools on traditional public schools (TPS). Using an event study design, we show that one type of specialized high school, North Carolina’s Cooperative Innovative High Schools, initially attracted students who were higher achieving and more likely to be white than TPS students, but these specialized schools became more representative of the district population over time. On average, the opening of specialized schools had a mix of null and positive spillover effects on TPS student achievement.

Cash and near-cash programs replace 32% of lost income on average over the two years following job loss and reduce the likelihood of experiencing poverty by 18 percentage points. 97% of transfer benefits paid in these two years come from Unemployment Insurance. Two years after job loss, the replacement rate is 28%, but this is largely driven by UI benefit extensions unique to the Great Recession. Public health insurance makes up for 17% of the loss in private insurance, but, even two years later, rates of uninsurance are higher than pre-job loss. Looking at heterogeneous effects, in general, the safety net is progressive, though we uncover important gaps in benefits for some disadvantaged groups.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001075

Our framework, adapted from a model of multiple threshold public goods, presents groups with several mutually exclusive projects, any of which require sufficient support from the group to succeed. Individuals strictly prefer to contribute where and how much they believe others expect of them to ensure joint project success. Groups tend to coordinate on the public good preferred by the wealthiest member, demonstrating a wealthy-interest bias even without corruption, politics, and information asymmetries. At the same time, groups divide costs in highly progressive ways, with the wealthy voluntarily funding a disproportionate share, helping offset the inherent inequality from endowment and selection differences.

Journal of Public Economics,2024,School segregation in the presence of student sorting and cream-skimming: Evidence from a school voucher reform,Ana M. Gazmuri,This paper uses a reform to Chile’s school choice system to study student socioeconomic segregation with a focus on student demand and school selectivity. The reform increases the subsidies that schools receive for low socioeconomic status students. I exploit this shock to schools’ incentives to test for selection at admission based on students’ socioeconomic characteristics. Schools respond to the new voucher by decreasing the level of cream-skimming. I incorporate these admission restrictions in a demand model to estimate parents’ preferences for school and peer characteristics. I show that ignoring admission restrictions leads to underestimating poor parents’ preferences for school quality. Counterfactual simulations show that preferences of high-SES parents for high-SES peers are one of the main drivers behind segregation as opposed to schools’ selective behavior. This likely explains the unexpected increase in enrollment for schools that opted out of the reform and the ineffectiveness of the reform in reducing socioeconomic segregation across schools.,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001129

Local governments may prioritize their constituents’ interests, resulting in suboptimal coastal development.

We leverage causal effects by applying a close-elections Regression Discontinuity Design to the universe of buildings in Spain. Municipalities with party-aligned mayors develop 46% less land than politically isolated ones, and politically homogeneous coastal areas develop less than fragmented ones. The effect is more salient for land closest to shore or previously occupied by forests, in municipalities with a large share of protected land, and for relevant environmental markers, such as air and bathing water pollution. These results underscore the importance of cooperative political endeavors in managing development spillovers, with environmental considerations assuming a central role.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001142

Journal of Public Economics,2024,Public pensions and retirement: Evidence from the Railroad Retirement Act,Matthew Pesner,"This paper estimates how public pensions affect retirement timing by examining the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, which replaced private railroad pensions with a national program comparable in many ways to Social Security. Leveraging linked decennial census records between 1910–1940, the first part of the analysis compares male labor force nonparticipation in 1940 relative to 1930, between workers previously in railroad versus other industries with broad pension coverage, and by age. Higher benefits led to earlier retirement, largely driven by exit at age 65. The second part of my analysis also exploits the switch from flat to progressive benefits in average wages to estimate the elasticity of nonparticipation with respect to benefits for men aged 65-69. My central estimate of 0.55 indicates a large retirement response. Application of these estimates to Social Security expansions in the 1950s suggests rising benefits was the key driver of earlier retirement among the already-insured male population during this era.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001221

Using German administrative tax data, we document that the average non-filer overpays €119 in one year, equivalent to a 1.2 percentage point increase in the average tax rate.

Extracting text from ten leading US newspapers over the last four decades, we use text-mining techniques to develop a granular news index of US environmental and climate policy (EnvP) over the 1981–2019 period. Furthermore, we develop a set of additional measures, namely an index of sentiment on environmental policy, as well as various topic-specific indexes. We validate our index by showing that it correctly captures trends and peaks in the evolution of US environmental and climate policy and that it has a meaningful association with clean investments, in line with environmental regulations supporting growing opportunities for clean markets. In firm-level estimations, we find that our index is associated with a greater probability of receiving venture capital (VC) funding for cleantech startups and reduced stock returns for high-emissions firms most exposed to environmental regulations. At the aggregate level, we find in VAR models that a shock in our news-based index of renewable energy policy is associated with an increase in the number of clean energy VC deals and in the assets under management of a benchmark clean energy exchange-traded fund.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001269

Bunching appears to be driven by tax evasion. Data from audited returns shows that bunching is present in returns before audit, but does not persist post-audit. Tax preparers play an important role, being twice as likely to deliver positive round-number refunds as individuals who file their own tax returns. Preparers with greater propensity to bunch deliver larger refunds by lifting deductions and lowering reported income for return items where audits are costly.

JRS have large favorable welfare effects and benefit all households when they are well targeted at potentially viable jobs at risk of being lost. These gains are particularly strong for liquid-asset-poor households, especially for those that are also unemployed or on furlough. The job protection component of JRS explains almost all the welfare gains they deliver, while their high level of generosity plays a minor role and has ambiguous net aggregate welfare effects. We also discuss the conditions that make JRS valuable and show that they can cause a decrease in welfare when they subsidize too many safe jobs; when they are targeted at non-viable jobs that will inevitably be lost once schemes end; and when implemented in economies where labor market frictions are low.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001348
Journal of Public Economics,2024,No country for young people? The rise of anti-immigration politics in ageing societies,Valerio Dotti,"We investigate the effects of population ageing on immigration policies using a citizen-candidate model of elections. In each period, young people work and pay taxes while old people receive social security payments. Immigrants are all young, meaning they contribute significantly to financing the cost of public services and social security. Among natives, the elderly and the poor benefit the most from public spending. However, since these two types of voters do not internalise the positive fiscal effects of immigration, they have a common interest in supporting candidates who seek to curb immigration and increase the tax burden on high-income individuals. Population ageing increases the size and, in turn, the political power of such sociodemographic groups, resulting in more restrictive immigration policies, a larger public sector, higher tax rates, and lower societal well-being. Calibrating the model to UK data suggests that the magnitude of these effects is large. The implications of this model are shown to be consistent with the patterns observed in UK attitudinal data.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272400135X

Declines in revenues, reductions in bond market access, and relationships with financial advisers and underwriters all strongly predict higher bank loan reliance. While resemblance between bank loans and bonds is limited, loans afford governments significant financial flexibility not otherwise available in the municipal bond market.

Moreover, people’s perceptions of what constitutes the relevant group are malleable, and affect their desire to give. These results suggest that government programs, such as progressive tax-and-transfer systems, can help satisfy other-regarding preferences for redistribution in a way that creating opportunities for voluntary giving cannot.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001361

Douglas Bernheim and Jonas Mueller-Gastell,"Previous studies of optimal default options demonstrate that either opt-out minimization or maximization is optimal under restrictive conditions. We obtain a general characterization of the solution by studying optimal defaults when one of the problem’s parameters approaches a limiting value. We interpret these “asymptotic optima” as approximate optima for non-limiting cases and justify this interpretation through numerical simulations. When the designer and choosers agree about the activity’s value, simple forms of weighted opt-out minimization are asymptotically optimal. Additional results encompass Pigouvian fees, normative ambiguity, and cases in which the designer and choosers disagree about the activity’s value.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001397
Journal of Public Economics,2024,The intergenerational effects of welfare transfers among single mothers: Evidence from an Israeli welfare reform,Yannay Shanan,"This paper examines the intergenerational effects of a welfare reform that increased welfare benefits generosity and eased eligibility requirements for single mothers in Israel. Using large-scale restricted administrative data and a difference-in-differences design, I find that the rise in single mothers’ welfare participation rates following the reform had a significant impact on their children’s long-term economic outcomes. Girls exposed to the reform in childhood were likelier to be on welfare themselves as young adults, while boys experienced a long-lasting increase in labor earnings. The results suggest that generous welfare programs can have beneficial consequences for boys growing up in single-parent households.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724001439
Journal of Public Economics,2024,The EITC and the extensive margin: A reappraisal,Henrik Kleven,"A strong consensus posits that the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has had sizable effects on extensive margin labor supply, especially for single mothers. This paper reappraises the difference-in-differences and event study approaches that underpin much of this consensus. The paper investigates every EITC reform at the state and federal level since the inception of the policy. All reforms are analyzed in an event study framework and a comprehensive analysis of model uncertainty is presented. Apart from the federal 1993 reform, EITC expansions are not associated with any clear and robust effects on employment. Treatment impact estimates from about 500 event studies are symmetrically distributed around zero. Specifications with large elasticities are outliers in the distribution. The 1993 reform, on the other hand, is associated with large employment increases for single mothers. Based on a number of different analyses, the paper shows that these increases align more closely with confounding effects from welfare reform and the macroeconomy than with the EITC. Overall, difference-in-differences and event study analyses of EITC reforms are fragile to specification choices and do not support robustly large effects.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000719

In particular, we examine the tax-policy response of municipalities that compete locally with “tax-haven municipalities”, i.e.municipalities that originally have set lower and, in some cases, even zero tax rates. The analysis distinguishes treated and not-treated municipalities based on their distance to a tax-haven. Our results show that the majority of municipalities do not change their tax policy.

This trend has been driven in part by Medicaid, which has significantly increased public financing of formal home care over the past few decades. Using the 2000–2016 Health and Retirement Study and a difference-in-difference and triple-difference design, I investigate the effects of a Medicaid policy adopted in over half of states that increased formal home care utilization among low-income older adults by more than 50%.

In particular, we consider ten commonly-studied patent characteristics that have received little or no attention in the extant literature on R&D incentives. Our empirical approach suggests that R&D tax credits reduce the user cost of R&D and increase R&D expenditure, but we find no aggregate evidence that such credits increase patenting in credit-adopting states. Nor do credits increase the scientific quality of patents, as captured by patent citations. On the other hand, R&D tax credits increase patent novelty and we see large and significant increases in the market value of patents in credit-adopting states. All of our aggregate results are driven by states with larger effective credits and by larger firms, because such firms produce the vast majority of patents.

The Social Security Administration imposes strict rules on representative compensation. Representatives are only paid if claimants are awarded disability, and they are paid the lesser of 25 percent of the claimant’s past due benefits or a pre-specified maximum fee ($7,200 since 2022). Because past due benefits are a function of the number of months claimants wait to be awarded, representatives face incentives to delay case resolution until past due benefits push the representative fees past the fee ceiling. We use difference-in-differences to evaluate how these incentives impact SSDI claimant wait times. After the fee ceiling increased in 2002, average wait times increased by 0.85 months among claimants for whom the fee threshold is more binding, implying a 2.6–5.6 month increase for claimants with representatives.

Our main suggestion is to treat economic inequality itself as an externality, which has wide-ranging implications for classical economic theory. We show this through the Mirrlees (1971) optimal non-linear income taxation model, where we focus on a post-tax income inequality externality. Optimal top marginal tax rates are particularly affected by the externality, implying a novel equality dimension to optimal top tax rate design. We propose that inequality’s externality properties may have larger optimal top tax rate implications than standard revenue concerns; our model thus provides a theoretical basis for real-world governmental tax choices that seem irrational under standard optimal taxation models. We also show that the total inequality aversion implied by the current U.S. tax system is insufficient to accommodate both social welfare weights that are decreasing in income and a significant concern for inequality’s externality effects.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000756

Most agents in the model are poor, leading to an equity motive for taxation. We calibrate the model to the US economy and find low positive levels of optimal capital income and wealth taxes. We express optimal tax rates as a closed-form function of the size of tax bases and their elasticities with respect to tax rates, highlighting the forces behind the result.

We propose a framework for measuring principals’ contributions to student outcomes and apply it empirically using data from Tennessee, New York City, and Oregon.

Based on our framework, which better accounts for bias from time-varying factors, we find that little of the variation in student test scores or attendance is explained by persistent effectiveness differences between principals. Across contexts, the estimated standard deviation of principal value-added is roughly 0.03 student-level standard deviations in math achievement and 0.01 standard deviations in reading.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000513

Simmler","A flourishing literature quantifies the corporate tax revenue losses from multinational profit shifting to low-tax economies. Other consequences of international tax avoidance have received little attention. In this paper, we empirically assess the widespread perception that international tax avoidance impacts product market outcomes and can put national competitors of multinational firms at a competitive disadvantage. The empirical identification strategy relies on changes in transfer pricing regulations that constrain multinational profit shifting by strategic mis-pricing of intra-firm trade. Based on rich data on firms in European high-tax countries, we show that tighter transfer pricing provisions raise multinational firms’ effective tax costs and lower their sales. The sales and profits of affected firms’ national competitors increase significantly, while mark-ups remain largely unchanged.

I use a staggered difference-in-differences design to dynamically compare stops between neighboring police beats. In the immediate aftermath of gun violence, I find a rise in total stops that corresponds with a decline in index crime incidents and results in more seized weapons and/or contraband. Over the next month, officers continue to conduct additional stops, but these stops prove unproductive in yielding illicit goods, and seemingly have no impact on crime. Stops resulting in enforcement action persist three months after gun violence. Non-White stops in regions with considerable gang concentration account for much of the baseline rise in total stops.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000537
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Limbo or leverage? Asylum waiting and refugee integration,"Olof Åslund, Mattias Engdahl and Olof Rosenqvist","We study labor market and health implications of asylum wait time, a policy margin with bearing on public finances. The analysis exploits a rapid and unexpected increase in pending applications, which extended processing times with several months for new asylum seekers to Sweden. Longer waiting slows down integration by delaying labor market entry and decreasing participation and performance in active policy measures. Accumulated earnings during the first four years after application are 2.6 percent lower per added month of waiting. The impact is due to delay, not to negative human capital effects of waiting per se. There is no evidence of detrimental effects on psychiatric or other forms of health. Importantly, our results suggest that asylum seekers in Sweden can use the waiting time for useful preparations. The analysis consistently indicates that case workers, teachers and employers involved in post-asylum integration measures perceive individuals who have waited longer as more prepared.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000549

Journal of Public Economics,2024,The “Benefits” of being small: Loose fiscal policy in the European Monetary Union,"Lamar Crombach, Frank Bohn and Jan-Egbert Sturm","Independent central banks typically counteract positive fiscal shocks that would otherwise increase the inflation rate above the target. In a theoretical model, we show that, in a monetary union, this mechanism implies weaker responses to national fiscal shocks because the overarching central bank must account for the fiscal policies of all members. The model highlights that the response is especially weak for small members, given their marginal impact on the union’s aggregate inflation rate. Empirically, we exploit the exogenous variation in elections to show that the European Central Bank reacts more vigorously to fiscal shocks from larger countries. We then provide evidence that small countries take advantage of this; they engage more in fiscal expansions during election years than large countries. In an extension, we discuss, both theoretically and empirically, why the difference between small and large countries disappears in times of crisis.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000562
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Dynamic effects of tax audits and the role of intentions,Tobias Gabel Christiansen,"Using a random audit program covering more than 17,000 tax returns, I study how tax audits affect the subsequent compliance behavior of self-employed with varying intentions to comply. Leveraging novel information provided by auditors on taxpayers’ perceived willingness to comply, I find that unintentional non-compliers, driven by inattention or misunderstandings of the tax rules, exhibit higher compliance in subsequent years. This results in a revenue increase equivalent to 340% of the tax uncovered from the audit after 5 years. In contrast, intentional non-compliers who deliberately evade taxes and are typically targeted for operational audits do not respond to audits and have a low recovery rate for evaded taxes. Based on these findings, I illustrate how risk scores derived from pre-audit information can be used to target taxpayers expected to respond strongly to audits, leading to increased revenue gains of 87% compared to an approach that focuses on initial revenue from audits. Finally, I propose targeted and personalized guidance as a cheaper alternative to mitigate unintentional misreporting compared to expensive audits.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000574

To address this question, we recruited N=851 Republicans for a study about net neutrality, an issue largely unfamiliar to the electorate, which refers to equal treatment of all internet traffic. In a pre-registered experiment, we randomly changed the order in which the following two types of information were provided: (i) partisan, underscoring Republicans’ opposition and Democrats’ support, and (ii) non-partisan, where the participants evaluated factual arguments about the pros and cons of the policy. Despite holding total information constant, we find that those who saw the non-partisan block first donated 46% more to a charity advocating for net neutrality (p=0.001).

In making these strategic choices, parties aim to encourage candidates to invest in the campaign, while also trying to secure advantages for their preferred candidates. We study how parties navigate this trade-off using a specific feature of the Norwegian local electoral system in which parties can give advantaged positions to some candidates in an otherwise open list. Our theory reveals that parties’ ex-ante electoral strength impacts their strategic decisions. Notably, the trade-off is weaker for more popular parties, allowing them to facilitate the election of their preferred candidates without compromising the party’s overall performance. We show empirically that the moral hazard concern is real, and that larger parties are indeed more likely to use their power to make some candidates safe. The advantage of large parties extends further: safeguarding specific candidates enables parties to achieve disproportionately favorable outcomes in post-electoral bargaining. These findings reveal new insights for political representations, policy outcomes, and intra-party dynamics more broadly.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000690

We provide experimental evidence showing significant heterogeneity in the updating behavior of meritocratic spectators, and, as a result, polarization in inequality acceptance. Finally, we show that the distributive decisions of third-party spectators are best explained by a structural model that allows for heterogeneity both in fairness views and belief updating, with heterogeneity in belief updating causing twice as much polarization in inequality acceptance as heterogeneity in fairness views. The findings contribute to better understanding of the foundations of inequality acceptance in society.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000331

Relying on the staggered introduction of SC across counties between 2008 and 2014, we find that the program reduced children’s participation in center-based child care programs. The estimated reductions are substantially larger among advantaged children and in jurisdictions with a greater fraction of undocumented individuals. We also find that SC reduced the equilibrium supply and wages of immigrant and native workers in the center-based sector as well as the number of center-based facilities.

Michael Collins and Samuel Wylde","This study analyzes patterns of housing consumption and expenditures among low-income households since 1985. For households in the bottom income quintile, real monthly housing expenditures have risen from $605 to $1,045. However, these increased expenditures partially reflect housing quantity improvements, including more square footage, more rooms, and larger lot sizes. The data also show a marked improvement in housing quality, such as fewer sagging roofs, broken appliances, rodents, and peeling paint. The housing quality for low-income households improved across all 35 indicators we can measure. These quality improvements equate to between a 34 to 43 percent increase in housing consumption and suggest that a typical low-income household in 2021 experiences housing quality equivalent to the average national household in 1985. Though relative housing consumption has remained similar, this “rising tide” of housing may have additional benefits for the well-being of families and children living in better housing.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000380

Using data from the Health and Retirement Study and a regression discontinuity design, I estimate the causal effects of aging into Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) regulations, which mandate withdrawals from retirement accounts upon reaching a specified age. First, I establish the effects of RMDs on asset decumulation in my setting and show a sharp increase in withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Next, I provide new evidence on the effects of RMDs on intergenerational transfers and show a concurrent, discontinuous increase in inter vivos gifts.

Journal of Public Economics,2024,Voters and the trade-off between policy stability and responsiveness,Antoine Loeper and Wioletta Dziuda,"Policy making involves a trade-off between policy responsiveness to changing circumstances and policy stability. Little is known, however, about how this trade-off is resolved in representative democracies. Anecdotal evidence suggests that policies not only fail to respond efficiently to changing circumstances but also change unnecessarily with political turnover. We study this trade-off in a dynamic election model with a voter and two parties with distinct ideologies in which all players incur a common cost for changing the policy from one period to the next. Before elections, the voter observes the current policy as well as a signal about her policy preference for the next period. We show that, consistent with empirical evidence, a liberal (conservative) incumbent is more likely to be reelected after having implemented a liberal (conservative) policy. Expecting this electoral bias, the incumbent is less responsive to the state and instead tilts policy making towards its ideology. Hence, as compared to a world without electoral pressures, policies under-respond to real shocks and over-respond to political turnover. We study how the resulting inefficiencies vary with preference for stability, voter’s information, ideological polarization, and office motivation of the parties.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272400029X
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Heterogeneity in the pass-through from oil to gasoline prices: A new instrument for estimating the price elasticity of gasoline demand,Lutz Kilian and Xiaoqing Zhou,"We propose a new instrument for estimating the price elasticity of gasoline demand that exploits systematic differences across U.S. states in the pass-through of oil price shocks to retail gasoline prices. We show that these differences are primarily driven by the cost of producing and distributing gasoline, which varies with states’ access to oil and gasoline transportation infrastructure, refinery technology, and environmental regulations, creating cross-sectional gasoline price shocks in response to an aggregate oil price shock. Time-varying estimates do not support the view that the gasoline demand elasticity has declined in absolute value to near zero since the 1980s. The elasticity was stable near −0.3 until the end of 2014. It rose to about −0.2 in 2015–16, but has remained stable since 2016. Gasoline demand is more responsive in states with lower personal income, higher unemployment rates and lower urban population shares. There is no evidence for an asymmetry in the elasticity with respect to positive and negative gasoline price shocks. We illustrate how these elasticity estimates inform the recent policy debate about the impact of gasoline tax holidays on consumers’ discretionary income and about the demand destruction from the spike in gasoline prices after the invasion of Ukraine.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272724000355

In this reform called Active Case Management (ACM), judges are instructed to take more active control of their cases by organizing pre-trial conferences and setting up deadlines with the overall objective of reducing adjournments; i.e., postponements of hearings to later dates. Importantly, the reform was implemented only in some pilot courts, selected in a plausibly exogenous way. We employ a triple difference analysis, comparing the time to disposition of criminal cases versus civil cases, in treated courts versus control courts, for cases filed before and after the reform.

Individuals exposed to the laws during adolescence were substantially less likely to suffer from cognitive and physical limitations in their 40s. The health effects are mirrored by improved labor market outcomes. These patterns cannot be attributed to changes in educational attainment or marriage.

Journal of Public Economics,2024,"Football, alcohol, and domestic abuse","Ria Ivandić, Tom Kirchmaier, Yasaman Saeidi and Neus Torres Blas","We study the role of alcohol and emotions in explaining the dynamics in domestic abuse following major football games. We match confidential and uniquely detailed individual call data from Greater Manchester with the timing of football matches over a period of eight years to estimate the effect on domestic abuse. We find that a football game changes the dynamics of abuse throughout the day. We first observe a decrease in incidents during the 2-hour duration of the game suggesting a substitution effect of football and domestic abuse. However, following the initial decrease, and after the game, domestic abuse starts increasing and peaks about ten hours after the game. We find that these effects are the strongest for early games and are driven by male perpetrators that had consumed alcohol. We find that football games lead to changing the dynamics from earlier to later periods in the day consistent with displacement effects, yet in the case when games are early and the perpetrator is alcoholized, football games lead to a cumulative increase in abuse. Unexpected game results are not found to differently affect domestic abuse dynamics.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272300213X
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Joint retirement of couples: Evidence from discontinuities in Denmark,Esteban Garcia-Miralles and Jonathan Leganza,"We study joint retirement and its underlying determinants. First, we use full-population data from Denmark and a discontinuity design to document joint retirement at the early pension eligibility age. For every 100 individuals who retire when they reach pension eligibility, around 8 of their spouses adjust their behavior to retire at the same time. Next, we investigate mechanisms. We begin by arguing that our estimates are explained primarily by leisure complementarities. We then explore heterogeneity and pathways couples take to retire together. We find that age differences are a fundamental determinant of joint retirement, which is driven by older spouses waiting to retire and claim pension benefits until their younger partners reach pension eligibility as well. We also show that females respond more than males and that secondary earners respond more than primary earners. Finally, we show that a reform increasing eligibility ages induced similar joint retirement spillovers.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002189
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Disparate racial impacts of Shelby County v. Holder on voter turnout,"Stephen B. Billings, Noah Braun, Daniel B. Jones and Ying Shi","In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court struck down a core provision of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) that enabled federal electoral oversight in select jurisdictions. We study whether this decision disproportionately impacted ballot access for Black and Hispanic registered voters. We use a rich dataset on voter behavior for the universe of registered voters combined with Census block-level sociodemographic attributes to document a decrease in turnout for Black, relative to white, individuals. We observe suggestive but less robust evidence of decreases in Hispanic turnout. These effects are concentrated in counties with larger Black and Hispanic populations, consistent with strategic targeting of voter suppression.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002293
Journal of Public Economics,2024,"Risky moms, risky kids? fertility and crime after the fall of the wall",Arnaud Chevalier and Olivier Marie,"Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the birth rate halved in East Germany. Using detailed state-cohort-level arrest-data, and a difference in differences strategy, we show that individuals born during this period of socio-economic turmoil were markedly more likely to be arrested than those conceived a few years earlier. This is the case for most crime types and both for boys and girls. Since these children grew-up in the same re-unified German environment, the differences in criminal activity are consistent with negative parental selection. We use individual-level data to highlight risk attitude as a potential mechanism linking maternal fertility decisions and children’s criminal activities. We show that mothers who gave birth between 1991 and 1993 in East Germany have a significantly greater preference for risk, and so do their children. Finally, we provide novel evidence of the strong correlation between high levels of risk preference and criminal participation.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272300230X
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Income effects and labour supply: Evidence from a child benefits reform,Mathias Fjællegaard Jensen and Jack Blundell,"In this paper, we exploit a unique and unexpected reform to the child benefit system in Denmark to assess the effects of child benefits on parental labour supply. A cap on child benefit payments in 2011 led to a non-negligible reduction in child benefits for larger families with young children while leaving child benefits for smaller families unchanged. The differential impact of this policy represents an opportunity to assess the causal impact of child benefit programmes on the labour supply of mothers and fathers. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that the reduction in benefits leads to a substantial increase in the labour supply of mothers. Mothers respond to the policy at both the intensive and extensive margins, with the latter outweighing the former, and the effect persists after controlling for fertility-related family characteristics. To fix preferences for additional children across treatment and control groups, we use data on parents’ medical consultations on sterilisation, a common procedure in Denmark.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002311
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Improving preschool provision and encouraging-demand: Evidence from a large-scale construction program,"Jan Berkes, Adrien Bouguen, Deon Filmer and Tsuyoshi Fukao","We study the impact of a preschool construction program and of two demand-side interventions in Cambodia. Within this context where other preschools are available, impacts are likely to differ between children who would have been enrolled in a preexisting preschool and those who would have stayed at home, with larger expected gains for the latter. After one year, we measure positive intent-to-treat impacts on an aggregate measure of development and show that the effect on children who would have stayed at home can be bounded (0.14-0.49 SD). Under heavier assumptions, we pinpoint this effect at 0.21 SD, while the effect on children who would have enrolled in another preschool is close to zero. These results are consistent with measures of preschool quality which imply that the newly constructed schools only significantly improved infrastructure, but did not improve the quality of educational processes. After two years, most impacts become insignificant suggesting that the advantage provided by preschool quickly vanished, specifically once children enrolled in primary school.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002323
Journal of Public Economics,2024,The effects of electronic monitoring on offenders and their families,"Julien Grenet, Hans Grönqvist and Susan Niknami","Electronic monitoring (EM) has emerged as a popular tool for curbing the growth of large prison populations. Evidence on the causal effects of EM on criminal recidivism is, however, limited and it is unclear how this alternative to incarceration affects the labor supply of offenders and the outcomes of their family members. We study the countrywide expansion of EM in Sweden in 1997 wherein offenders sentenced to up to three months in prison were granted the option to substitute incarceration with EM. Our difference-in-differences estimates, which compare the change in the prison inflow rate of treated offenders to that of non-treated offenders with slightly longer sentences, show that the reform significantly decreased the number of incarcerations. Our main finding is that EM not only lowers criminal recidivism but also increases labor supply. Additionally, EM improves the educational attainment and early-life earnings of the children whose parents were exposed to the reform. The primary mechanisms through which EM operates appear to involve the preservation of offenders’ ties to the labor market, by reducing the barriers to both finding a job and changing employers. Our calculations suggest that the social benefits stemming from EM are about seven times larger than the fiscal savings associated with reduced prison expenditures, implying that the welfare gains from EM could be much greater than previously acknowledged.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002335
Journal of Public Economics,2024,The econometrics of happiness: Are we underestimating the returns to education and income?,Christopher Barrington-Leigh,"This paper describes a fundamental and empirically conspicuous problem inherent to surveys of human feelings and opinions in which subjective responses are elicited on numerical scales. The paper also proposes a solution. The problem is a tendency by some individuals — particularly those with low levels of education — to simplify the response scale by considering only a subset of possible responses such as the lowest, middle, and highest. In principle, this “focal value rounding” (FVR) behavior renders invalid even the weak ordinality assumption often used in analysis of such data. With “happiness” or life satisfaction data as an example, descriptive methods and a multinomial logit model both show that the effect is large and that education and, to a lesser extent, income level are predictors of FVR behavior. A model simultaneously accounting for the underlying wellbeing and for the degree of FVR is able to estimate the latent subjective wellbeing, i.e. the counterfactual full-scale responses for all respondents, the biases associated with traditional estimates, and the fraction of respondents who exhibit FVR. Addressing this problem helps to resolve a longstanding puzzle in the life satisfaction literature, namely that the returns to education, after adjusting for income, appear to be small or negative. Due to the same econometric problem, the marginal utility of income in a subjective wellbeing sense has been consistently underestimated.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002347
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Moving opportunities: The impact of mixed-income public housing regenerations on student achievement,Lorenzo Neri,"I use mixed-income public housing regenerations in London as a natural experiment to identify how schools affect low-income students’ educational achievement when affluent households flow into their neighborhood. I compare student achievement in schools in the same neighborhood located at different distances from a regeneration before and after its completion. I employ a grandfathering instrument for enrollment in treated schools to address potential endogenous mobility. Students exposed to regenerations have higher test scores at the end of primary school. I estimate that schools explain 65–81% of the overall achievement effects, which are mediated by changes in the student body’s composition.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002359
Journal of Public Economics,2024,No-claim refunds and healthcare use,"Daniel Avdic, Simon Decker, Martin Karlsson and Martin Salm","No-claim refunds are cost-control instruments which stipulate a payback agreement contingent on one or more claim-free years. We study how such no-claim refunds affect claiming behavior using claims data from a large German health insurer and a policy that increased the refund size for certain plans. We propose a method to decompose the effect on claims into behavioral and non-behavioral components, and show that individuals responded to the refund policy by reducing claims by eight percent on average. The effect persisted for several years; behavioral responses were stronger for clients with more to gain from the policy; and reductions in claims were not restricted to treatments of questionable medical value.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002438
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Credit access and housing insecurity: Evidence from winter utility shutoff protections,Alison Lodermeier,"Fifty-six percent of urban renters face some level of housing insecurity. I explore the role of credit access, or lack thereof, as a contributing factor. To do so, I study a temporary line of credit extended to households in the form of protection from heat shutoffs during the winter. These protections allow households to delay winter energy payments without risk of losing their heat. I adopt a triple difference-in-differences (DDD) approach, leveraging variation in states’ shutoff protection dates and census tracts’ average energy burdens. I estimate that the temporary extension of credit reduces the eviction filing rate by 4% in census tracts with high energy burdens. I provide suggestive evidence that eviction filings do not spike after the temporary credit access ends, implying a net negative effect of temporary credit access on filings over the entire year. I further demonstrate that a 3% increase in rental payments explains the decline in eviction filings, which is consistent with access to credit allowing renters to smooth consumption.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002463
Journal of Public Economics,2024,Centralization and regulatory enforcement: Evidence from personnel authority reform in China,Dongmin Kong and Chenhao Liu,"This paper examines the impacts of the centralization of authority in the appointment of civil servants on the effectiveness of regulatory enforcement efforts. We exploit a unique personnel reform in China’s Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs), which shifts the power to appoint local EPB directors from municipal governments to the provincial level. Based on detailed personnel records and administrative punishment data, we find that local EPB directors under centralized personnel authority increase the number of punishments and the total amount of fines by 13.0% and 19.0%, respectively. The impact on environmental enforcement remains of comparable magnitude even after 3 years, resulting in improved environmental quality. We identify three possible mechanisms driving this positive effect: the reduction of distorted incentives, the enforcement of objectives with interjurisdictional externalities, and the selection of more qualified appointees. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of the consequences of the recent trend toward “reverse decentralization” in institutional settings.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002128

Difference-in-differences analysis reveals a comparatively large consumption drop after the loss of a formal job, resulting from shifts towards lower-quality informal employment and an associated earnings penalty. Exploiting a UB kink, we then show that higher UBs delay program exit through a substitution of formal with informal employment. Even when conservatively estimated, however, welfare effects are positive for coefficients of risk aversion exceeding two.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002141

Exploiting the random assignment of administrative law judges to disability insurance cases, we find that benefit allowance increases 10-year mortality rates by 2.8 percentage points for marginal beneficiaries. However, using a Marginal Treatment Effects approach, we find evidence that benefit receipt reduces mortality for inframarginal beneficiaries, who are typically less healthy than marginal beneficiaries. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that allowance reduces mortality among those with expensive health conditions such as cancer.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002153

It does so by exploiting county-level variation in the reintroduction of work requirements after the Great Recession. We find that new SNAP work requirements lead more people to seek out new credit and lead to an increase in credit account openings. New work requirements also result in an increase in total outstanding credit balances as well as an increase in past due balances. These findings suggest that individuals are turningto credit and debt products to cover expenses after losing SNAP eligibility.,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272723002165
