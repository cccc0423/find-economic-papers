Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Windfall income shocks with finite planning horizons,Michael Boutros,"I study how the cognitive demands of financial planning shape household decisionmaking with respect to consumption out of windfall income shocks. I build a quantitative model of bounded rationality in which reoptimization is costly. Households respond to windfall income shocks by choosing a finite planning horizon over which to reoptimize, and the optimal planning horizon is increasing in wealth and the magnitude of the income shock. Calibrated to U.S. data, the model’s distribution of consumption responses is consistent with three key facts: even highly liquid households have large consumption responses out of income shocks, the fraction of households with positive consumption responses increases with shock size, and conditional on responding, larger shocks generate smaller consumption responses.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001825
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Manufacturing risk-free government debt,"Zhengyang Jiang, Hanno Lustig, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh and Mindy Z. Xiaolan","In the presence of aggregate risk, governments face a trade-off between insuring taxpayers or bondholders. The literature assumes that the government can finance deficits at the risk-free rate, protecting bondholders at the expense of taxpayers. We characterize the implications of this assumption on the surplus process. Under reasonable debt dynamics, counter-cyclical debt issuance that protects taxpayers against adverse macro-economic shocks is limited in time and scope, and comes at the expense of higher long-run risk. We find that the restrictions imposed by risk-free debt are rejected in U.S. surplus data, especially after the GFC. Taxpayers have been protected at the expense of bondholders.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002119
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Bank consolidation and uniform pricing,João Granja and Nuno Paixão,"We evaluate how bank mergers affect consumer welfare when banks set deposit rates with a high degree of uniformity across their branch networks. First, we document that merger-induced changes to local market concentration are only weakly correlated with pricing decisions. Second, we develop a structural model of the banking sector to simulate equilibrium post-merger deposit rates with and without uniform pricing. The simulated deposit rates from the model with uniform pricing best match the observed changes in deposit rates following bank mergers. We use the model to evaluate antitrust decisions that force acquirers to divest branches in order to contain local market concentration levels. Our counterfactual exercises suggest that forced divestitures sometimes improve consumer welfare but can also impose consumer welfare losses when antitrust regulators do not consider that uniform pricing practices might lead to better deposit rates at acquired branches after a merger.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002120
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Public goods under financial distress,Pawel Janas,"I examine the effects of public debt on municipal services and real outcomes during financial crises using a unique archival dataset of U.S. cities from 1924 to 1943. Unlike today’s countercyclical fiscal policies, the Great Depression provides a rare setting to observe fiscal shocks without substantial intergovernmental or Federal Reserve support. My findings show that financial market frictions – especially the need to refinance debt – led cities to sharply cut expenditures, particularly on capital projects and police services. As urban development halted during the Depression, cities with high pre-crisis debt levels faced significant austerity pressures, a decline in population growth, a rise in crime, and a departure of skilled public servants from municipal governments.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002132
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,"Richer earnings dynamics, consumption and portfolio choice over the life cycle",Julio Gálvez and Gonzalo Paz-Pardo,"Households face earnings risk which is non-normal and varies by age and over the income distribution. We show that allowing for rich features of earnings dynamics, in the context of a structurally estimated life-cycle portfolio choice model, helps to rationalize the limited stock market participation and the low risky asset holdings of households. Because people are subject to more background risk than previously considered, the estimated model implies a substantially lower coefficient of risk aversion and lower stock market participation costs. Older workers and higher earners are exposed to negatively skewed risk and choose lower stock exposures.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002144
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Appropriated growth,"Yuchen Chen, Xuelin Li, Richard T. Thakor and Colin Ward","We assess how labor mobility affects intangible investment in a dynamic agency model featuring both knowledge appropriation and moral hazard. We argue that restricting worker mobility, while reducing employees’ appropriation of firm intangible capital, can hurt their incentives to exert effort. Our calibration to U.S. data targets responses of employee turnover and firms’ intangible investment to variations in workers’ outside option values, identified through exogenous shocks to non-compete enforcement. The model simulation shows that knowledge spillovers mitigate the costs of incentive provision when agency frictions are severe, and the optimal labor mobility regulation should balance this benefit against turnover risk. Finally, we highlight the use of deferred compensation bonuses in the optimal contract as a retention mechanism, even among under-performing firms.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002156
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Investing in misallocation,Mete Kılıç and Şelale Tüzel,"We document that 20% of Compustat firms exhibit above-median investment rates despite having below-median marginal product of capital (MPK), seemingly “misallocating” resources. These firms are typically younger and more likely to experience substantial upwards jumps in sales and MPK in subsequent years. They contribute significantly to innovation, and their investments predict future aggregate productivity, creating value beyond their current MPK. We propose and estimate a simple endogenous firm growth model that captures key cross-sectional features and enables counterfactual analysis. Ignoring the potential for future jumps in hypothetical investment policies reduces MPK and investment dispersion but also lowers aggregate productivity.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002168
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Sequential credit markets,Ulf Axelson and Igor Makarov,"Entrepreneurs typically seek financing in decentralized markets, where they approach investors sequentially. We develop a model of sequential capital markets with privately informed investors. The sequential market creates a dynamic adverse selection externality that leads to overinvestment and excessive rents to intermediaries, even as the number of competing investors becomes arbitrary large. The resulting rents lead to excessive entry of investors and insufficient entry of entrepreneurs. Moving to a centralized market structure or reducing transparency restores competitiveness but may harm efficiency. The model also explains how even a small skill advantage for an investor can lead to preferential deal flow and outsized returns.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002247
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,The benchmark greenium,"D’Amico, Stefania, Johannes Klausmann and N. Aaron Pancost","Exploiting the “twin” structure of German government green and conventional securities, we use a dynamic term structure model to estimate a time-varying greenium stemming solely from investors’ green values and not their cash flow expectations. This greenium is distinct from the yield spread between the twin securities (the green spread), as the model purifies it from pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors unrelated to environmental concerns. While the green spread correlates with stock market prices, the conventional convenience yield, and temporary demand-supply imbalances, our greenium correlates only with proxies of environmental concerns. We also estimate expected green returns, which incorporate greenium risk.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002259
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Social media as a bank run catalyst,"J. Anthony Cookson, Corbin Fox, Javier Gil-Bazo, Juan F. Imbet and Christoph Schiller","After the run on Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023, U.S. regional banks entered a period of significant distress. We quantify social media’s role in this distress using comprehensive Twitter data. During the SVB run period, banks with high pre-existing exposure to Twitter lost 4.3 percentage points more stock market value. Moreover, Twitter pre-exposure interacts significantly with classical run risks to predict greater run severity and greater deposit outflows during Q1-2023, effects unexplained by other banking or market characteristics. At the hourly frequency during the run, high Twitter attention over the past four hours predicts stock market losses, especially for banks with high run risks. By contrast, we find that negative Twitter sentiment does not amplify bank run risks. Rather, our evidence points to a distinctive role of Twitter attention, particularly when tweets are retweeted broadly.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002260
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Do teams alleviate or exacerbate overreaction in beliefs?,"Ricardo Barahona, Stefano Cassella, Kristy A.E. Jansen and Vincenzo Pezone","We investigate whether teams exhibit increased or reduced overreaction in expectation formation relative to individuals. Using preregistered randomized experiments that directly elicit expectations about future returns, we find that teams display lower belief overreaction to recent investment performance. A quantitative decomposition shows that this team effect stems primarily from a “self-selection” mechanism, whereby the most biased team member chooses to influence the team decision less. An LLM-based analysis of team interactions reinforces this result. A complementary analysis of US equity mutual fund managers operating both individually and as part of a team yields consistent evidence of lower overreaction in teams.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002272
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Prospect theory in the field: Revealed preferences from mutual fund flows,"Bing Han, Pengfei Sui and Wenhao Yang","Using mutual fund flows, we evaluate prospect theory with choice outcomes in the market. We provide strong support for prospect theory: under a standard set of parameters, funds whose past returns generate higher prospect theory value attract significantly larger future flows; we also find corroborative evidence using account-level data. Taking a revealed preference approach, we estimate the prospect theory parameters through a discrete choice model and find that our field-based estimates align well with previous experiment-based estimates. Moreover, we show that prospect theory offers a new framework for understanding flows, as it has explanatory power beyond existing drivers.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002296
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Intermediation frictions in equity markets,Bryan Seegmiller,"Stocks with similar characteristics but different levels of ownership by financial institutions have returns and risk premia that comove very differently with shocks to the risk-bearing capacity of dealer banks. After observable stock characteristics are accounted for, excess returns on more intermediated stocks have higher betas on contemporaneous shocks to intermediary willingness to take risk and are more predictable by state variables that proxy for intermediary health. Intermediary risk-bearing capacity also explains a substantial and increasing fraction of the variation in conditional risk premia for portfolios sorted on intermediation. These effects are concentrated in stocks held by hedge funds or mutual fund investors who are more likely to be exposed to dealer banks. The empirical evidence supports the predictions of asset pricing models in which financial intermediaries are marginal investors but face frictions that induce changes in their risk-bearing capacity.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002314
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Government bond risk and return in the US and China,"Jennifer N. Carpenter, Fangzhou Lu and Robert F.

We estimate the joint dynamics of the volatility and Sharpe ratio of principal-component bond-factor portfolios for the US and China. Predictors include yield curve variables and, for the US, VIX. We document complex time-varying relations between the price and quantity of interest rate risk inconsistent with the frameworks in existing studies. Interesting differences between the US and China further highlight the need for our more flexible approach.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002326
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,"Regional Banks, Aggregate Effects",Quinn Maingi,"I develop and estimate a quantitative spatial model featuring banks’ spatial lending networks to study the real effects of bank funding shocks. I apply the model to the 2023 regional bank panic. I show that, during the panic, deposits were reallocated towards regional banks with better marginal lending opportunities, which offered higher deposit rates. This reallocation substantially mitigated the otherwise negative aggregate output effects of the remaining, panic-related deposit flows. This positive reallocation effect is primarily driven by inflows into banks with good lending opportunities, suggesting that fundamental forces, rather than panic-driven idiosyncratic runs, are behind the positive reallocation effect.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2500234X
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,The canary in the coal decline: Appalachian household finance and the transition from fossil fuels,"Joshua Blonz, Brigitte Roth Tran and Erin Troland","We use individual-level credit data to study how recent declines in Appalachian coal mining affected household finances between 2011 and 2018. Using exogenous variation in electricity sector demand for coal, we find declines in coal demand decreased credit scores and increased financial distress within two years of coal shocks. These effects cannot be explained solely by job losses in coal mine worker households. Credit score declines and financial distress were largest among older individuals and people with lower-middle credit scores. Our results suggest the transition away from fossil fuels may impose meaningful costs on other fossil fuel extraction communities.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001758
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Implicit extrapolation and the beliefs channel of investment demand,Haoyang Liu and Christopher Palmer,"We document implicit extrapolation in investment decision-making that exceeds the extrapolation inferable from stated expectations. Locally experienced returns predict individual real-estate investment decisions even conditional on an investor’s forecasted home-price growth and risk aversion. Moreover, estimates of this experience effect on investment are larger than implied by the combined effect of past returns on stated expectations and stated expectations on investment. We demonstrate that heterogeneous forecast confidence helps explain why many investors rely on past returns over their survey-elicited forecasts. As their rationale, such survey respondents frequently cite intentional extrapolation or a lack of confidence in other belief factors.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001801
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Policy news and stock market volatility,"Scott R. Baker, Nicholas Bloom, Steven J. Davis and Kyle Kost","We use newspapers to create Equity Market Volatility (EMV) trackers at daily and monthly frequencies. Our headline EMV tracker moves closely with the VIX and the S&P500 returns volatility in and out of sample. We exploit the volume of newspaper text to construct forty category-specific EMV trackers. News about commodity markets, interest rates, real estate markets, aggregate activity, and inflation figure prominently in EMV articles. Policy news is another major source of market volatility: 30 % of EMV articles discuss tax policy, 30 % discuss monetary policy, and 25 % refer to some form of regulation. Combining our newspaper-based trackers with textual analysis of 10-K filings, we obtain monthly firm-level risk exposure measures. These measures help explain the cross-sectional structure of realized volatilities and its evolution over time, even after conditioning on firm and time fixed effects.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001953
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Institutions’ return expectations across assets and time,Magnus Dahlquist and Markus Ibert,"We study the equity, cash, and corporate bond risk premium expectations of asset managers, investment consultants, wealth advisors, public pension funds, and professional forecasters. Subjective risk premia vary one-to-one with objective risk premia that are available in real time and countercyclical. Despite their significant time-series variation, several subjective equity premia vary more in the cross-section of institutions than in the time series. This heterogeneity persists both over time and across asset classes. We tie the heterogeneity in subjective equity return expectations to heterogeneous expectations about long-term equity valuations: some institutions believe that the price–earnings ratio behaves like a random walk, whereas others believe in varying degrees of mean reversion.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001965
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Policy uncertainty reduces green innovation,"Mengyu Wang, Jeffrey Wurgler and Hong Zhang","Policy uncertainty can undermine the power of government subsidies to stimulate environmentally friendly research and development. We show that Chinese firms’ green R&D falls as the uncertainty of environmental subsidies rises: Exogenous, weather-driven air pollution variability induces subsidies to fluctuate, and firms in areas with high weather-driven subsidy variability undertake less green R&D and hire fewer technical employees, controlling for the average level of subsidies. Heavy emitters and environmental technology firms are more affected. The results also illustrate how policy uncertainty can arise when policymakers are influenced by conditions that are salient but with causes that are difficult to disentangle.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001977
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Discount factors and monetary policy: Evidence from dual-listed stocks,"Quentin Vandeweyer, Minghao Yang and Constantine Yannelis","This paper studies the transmission of monetary policy to the stock market through investors’ discount factors. To isolate this channel, we investigate the effect of US monetary policy surprises on the ratio of prices of the same stock listed simultaneously in Hong Kong and Mainland China. We identify a strong discount rate channel driven exclusively by cycle-amplifying surprises, defined as rate cuts during easing cycles and surprise hikes during tightening cycles. A 100 basis point of such cycle-amplifying surprise induces a 30 basis point change in the price ratio within five days.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001989
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Demand disagreement,Christian Heyerdahl-Larsen and Philipp Illeditsch,"Disagreement about macroeconomic fundamentals accounts for only part of the disagreement about future interest rates, creating a “disagreement correlation” puzzle. This puzzle arises because standard equilibrium models with belief differences predict a strong link between asset return disagreement and fundamental disagreement, a link not supported by the data. We address this puzzle by introducing a model where disagreement about future demand for savings—driven by disagreement over the prevalence of patient versus impatient investors in the economy—generates asset return disagreement. Our mechanism produces stochastic yield volatility, time-varying bond risk premia, and an upward-sloping yield curve. Empirically, we construct a proxy for demand disagreement by isolating the component of yield disagreement unrelated to disagreement about macro-fundamentals. This proxy is positively related to yields and their volatilities, and predicts future bond risk premia, consistent with the predictions of our demand disagreement model.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001990
Journal of Financial Economics,2026,Securing technological leadership? The cost of export controls on firms,"Matteo Crosignani, Lina Han, Marco Macchiavelli and André F. Silva","To safeguard its technological leadership, the U.S. has restricted domestic suppliers from exporting cutting-edge technologies to selected Chinese firms. Domestic firms affected by these export controls halt sales to Chinese customers, as intended, but struggle to establish new relations with alternative customers domestically or in politically aligned regions. Consequently, domestic suppliers experience sizable losses in market capitalization, along with reductions in profitability, employment, and bank lending. Chinese firms are more proactive in reconfiguring supply chains, though not without costs. Overall, export controls impose larger costs on U.S. firms developing the very technologies these policies aim to protect.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002004

Rossi","We study the nature and effects of cultural biases in choice under risk and uncertainty by comparing peer-to-peer loans the same individuals (lenders) make alone and after observing robo-advised suggestions. When unassisted, lenders are more likely to choose co-ethnic borrowers, facing 8% higher defaults and 7.3pp lower returns. Robo-advising does not affect diversification but reduces lending to high-risk co-ethnic borrowers. Lenders in locations with high inter-ethnic animus drive the results, even when borrowers reside elsewhere. Biased beliefs explain these results better than a conscious taste for discrimination: lenders rarely override robo-advised matches to ethnicities they discriminated against when unassisted.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25002107
