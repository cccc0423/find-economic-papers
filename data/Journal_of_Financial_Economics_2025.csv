Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Surviving the fintech disruption,"Wei Jiang, Yuehua Tang, Rachel J. Xiao and Vincent Yao","We examine the impact of fintech on firm labor demand, job turnover, and firm performance. Occupations with higher exposure to fintech experience a net decline in job postings and employment, though both complementary and substitutive effects emerge across different sectors. Fintech blurs traditional industry boundaries, creating demand for workers with a combination of finance and technology skills. In response, firms upskill through hiring, reallocate talent internally, and pivot innovation to new areas. As a result, firms are better equipped to absorb the shock than individual workers, with innovative firms even experiencing growth in employment, sales, and productivity upon fintech disruption.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000790
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Printing away the mortgages: Fiscal inflation and the post-covid boom,"William Diamond, Tim Landvoigt and Germán Sánchez Sánchez","We analyze interactions between fiscal and monetary stimulus in a new Keynesian model with nominal mortgage debt that can be inflated away. Redistributive transfers are most impactful when followed by a temporary deviation from inflation-targeting monetary policy. Unlike other fiscal policies, redistribution causes inflation even in the absence of long-run debt sustainability problems, and inflating away mortgages results in additional redistribution. In a quantitative model with mortgage refinancing frictions, transfer payments provide much more stimulus than the redistributive effects of inflation. Borrowers gradually refinance after their mortgages are inflated away, dampening their immediate consumption response and reducing their long-run labor supply.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000807
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,CRISK: Measuring the climate risk exposure of the financial system,"Hyeyoon Jung, Robert Engle and Richard Berner","We develop a market-based methodology to assess banks’ resilience to climate-related risks and study the climate-related risk exposure of large global banks. We introduce a new measure, CRISK, which is the expected capital shortfall of a bank in a climate stress scenario. To estimate CRISK, we construct climate risk factors and dynamically measure banks’ stock return sensitivity (that is, climate beta) to the climate risk factor. We validate the climate risk factor empirically and the climate beta estimates by using granular data on large US banks’ loan portfolios. The measure is useful in quantifying banks’ climate-related risk exposure through the market risk and the credit risk channels.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000844
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Differential access to dark markets and execution outcomes,James Brugler and Carole Comerton-Forde,"Dark pools can restrict access for specific trader types. We compare execution outcomes between dark pools that restrict high frequency trader access and those that do not. We find that trades executed in dark pools with more access restrictions have less order flow information leakage, adverse selection risk and post-trade order imbalances than trades in less restricted pools. Evidence from exogenous dark pool closures demonstrates that these differences are causal. The ability to segment order flow can benefit investors because it allows them to make trade-offs between execution risk and information leakage across different dark venues.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000947
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,"The economics of “Buy Now, Pay Later”: A merchant’s perspective","Tobias Berg, Valentin Burg, Jan Keil and Manju Puri","“Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) is a key innovation in consumer payments. It bundles the sale of a product with a subsidized loan, effectively offering lower prices to low-creditworthiness customers. BNPL thereby allows merchants to price-discriminate among customers with different willingness-to-pay. Consistent with a price-discrimination mechanism, we show that BNPL increases sales by 20%, driven by low-creditworthiness customers and products where market power is larger. We find that the benefits of offering BNPL significantly outweigh the costs for the merchant. Our findings help to explain the surge in popularity of BNPL in e-commerce around the world.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001011
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,The impact of prices on analyst cash flow expectations: Reconciling subjective beliefs data with rational discount rate variation,Aditya Chaudhry,"I show that prices impact analyst cash flow expectations and argue this impact can partially reconcile subjective beliefs data with asset pricing models in which investors have rational expectations and discount rate variation drives prices. Previous work argues that correlations of biased analyst cash flow expectations with prices and future returns contradict rational models and imply biased investor expectations distort prices. However, using two instrumental variables for price, I find increases in price unrelated to cash flow news raise analyst cash flow expectations. Based on this empirical finding, I propose a model with rational investors that matches key moments in beliefs data: analysts form biased cash flow expectations by learning from prices that contain discount rate variation. Thus, while stylized facts in beliefs data can be consistent with investors having biased expectations that distort prices, these facts can also be consistent with investors having rational expectations and analysts learning from prices.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001035

Strahan and Jun Yang","This paper studies banks’ investment in risk management human capital following the Global Financial Crisis and the advent of stress testing. Our results suggest that ‘Too Big to Fail’ distortions may have weakened large banks’ incentive to invest in risk management talent. Stress testing, which focuses on the largest banks, spurred demand for skilled quantitative risk managers, but only narrowly in anticipation of a test and following poor performance on a test. Stress testing does not affect demand for the over 90 % of risk management jobs not linked to passing tests, limiting its effectiveness in improving risk management practices.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001126
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Conditional risk and the pricing kernel,David Schreindorfer and Tobias Sichert,"We propose a statistical methodology for jointly estimating the pricing kernel and conditional physical return densities from option prices. Pricing kernel estimates show that negative stock market returns are significantly more painful to investors in low-volatility periods. Density estimates reflect a significantly positive risk–return trade-off, suggest that Martin’s (2017) lower bound on the equity premium is violated in high-volatility periods, and provide new evidence on the variance premium’s predictive power for excess returns as well as the co-movement between higher return moments. Lastly, we show that leading macrofinance models are at odds with basic features of conditional stock market risks and risk pricing.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2500114X

Target hospitals maintain their survival rates while significantly reducing employment and wage expenditures. The number of core medical workers drops temporarily, but returns to its pre-acquisition level in the long run. However, administrative job and wage cuts persist over the long term, particularly at previously nonprofit hospitals.

Market segmentation between the equity and bond markets appears to be the underlying mechanism: (i) The cross-return predictability is muted in the bond market; (ii) The cross-return predictability is mitigated in the presence of cross-holding investors; (iii) Equity analysts slowly incorporate information from rating-comovement links to their forecasts.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25001187

Our findings indicate that while receivers benefit from trading cost savings, they primarily bear adverse selection costs and experience worse outcomes when informed trading is prevalent. Mandatory trade reporting improves receiver outcomes by revealing dealers’ private information, but the benefits are reduced when reporting is delayed. Our results emphasize the importance of transparency regime design and suggest potential market fragility: if information asymmetry becomes severe, receivers may withdraw from the block market.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000698
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Redeploying dirty assets: The impact of environmental,Jason Chen,"This paper investigates how firms’ pollution incentives are influenced by their ability to divest polluted assets. My empirical setting is a major reform that exempts purchasers from liability for past contamination. Using a difference-in-differences framework, I find that the reform reduces toxic emissions, lowers bankruptcy risk, and increases firm value. Cross-sectional tests show that the decline in emissions is driven by firms with weaker financial health and fewer assets. These findings highlight a novel net worth channel: by limiting ex-post liability, the reform enhances landowners’ net worth ex-ante, reducing their incentives to engage in risky behavior, such as excessive emissions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000789

These flows induce substantial changes in the Chilean foreign exchange rate due to the funds’ high allocation to international securities. Local banks provide liquidity to pension funds in the spot market and their hedging transactions propagate the demand fluctuations from the spot to the forward market, resulting in deviations from covered interest rate parity. Using bank balance sheet data, we confirm that banks’ risk bearing constraints create limits to arbitrage.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000832

Using comprehensive data on millions of American workers across the economy, I find three key patterns. First, entrepreneurial coworkers inspire and teach entrepreneurship: individuals are more likely to become entrepreneurs after working with coworkers who previously led young businesses. Second, these effects predominantly occur within demographic groups, perpetuating lower entrepreneurship rates for women and Black Americans. Third, these workplace spillovers can increase productivity: individuals exposed to relatively successful coworkers subsequently run successful companies too.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000856

Kim, Jonathan Parker and Antoinette Schoar","Using financial account data linking small businesses to their owner households, we examine how business owners’ consumption responded to changes in business revenues during the COVID-19 crisis. In the first two months following the National Emergency, business revenues declined by 40 percent, largely driven by national factors rather than local infection rates or policies. However, the pass-through of revenue losses to owner consumption was limited: each dollar of revenue loss resulted in only a 1.6-cent decline in consumption. This muted pass-through persisted through 2021, even after the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines. Our findings suggest that federal subsidies and pandemic-induced reductions in spending opportunities explain the limited impact.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2500087X

Using high-frequency regulatory data, we estimate the sensitivity of weekly bank trading profits to aggregate equity, fixed-income, credit, currency, and commodity risk factors. Our estimates imply that U.S. banks had large trading exposures to equity market risk before the Volcker Rule, which they curtailed afterwards. Credit and currency risk exposures were smaller. The results hold up in a quasi-natural experiment that exploits the phased-in introduction of reporting requirements for identification. Total trading-book risk was also curtailed afterwards with material financial stability implications and no evidence of migration to other bank activities.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000881

Estimated treatment effects that are false, biased, or hard to interpret become a concern. Neither unit fixed effects nor standard term-structure controls resolve the problem. Solutions that overcome imperfect matching involve estimating the term structure of hypothesized treatment, which is also what is economically interesting (regardless of matching efficiency). These issues are not unique to DiD analysis, but are generic to group-assignment settings.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000893
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Do intermediaries improve GSE lending? Evidence from proprietary GSE data,"Joshua Bosshardt, Ali Kakhbod and Amir Kermani","We analyze the trade-offs of having intermediaries originate government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgages using proprietary GSE data. We first find evidence of lenders pricing for observable and unobservable default risk independently of the GSEs. We then develop and estimate a model of competitive lending in which lenders have skin-in-the-game and conduct additional screening beyond the GSEs’ criteria. Lenders reduce costs via screening but also charge markups. On net, interest rates are higher compared to a counterfactual effectively without intermediaries. In an extension, the observed differences between banks and nonbanks are more consistent with differences in their skin-in-the-game rather than screening quality.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2500090X
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,A quantitative analysis of bank lending relationships,Kyle Dempsey and Miguel Faria-e-Castro,"We study the aggregate consequences of dynamic lending relationships in a model of heterogeneous banks facing financial frictions. We estimate the model’s loan demand system on administrative loan-level data: the market power implied by the estimated strength and persistence of relationships yields a long run reduction in credit of 5.9%. Relationships amplify the negative real effects of credit supply shocks, but mute those of negative credit demand shocks. In a financial crisis which destroys 25% of bank net worth, for example, loan volume drops more than twice as much in our baseline model than in a competitive analog with no relationships, but banks recapitalize faster.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000911

Prospective fallen angels — risky firms just above the IG cutoff — enjoyed subsidized bond financing in 2009–19. This effect is driven by Fed purchases of securities inducing long-duration IG-focused investors to rebalance their portfolios towards higher-yielding IG bonds. The benefiting firms (i) exploited the sluggish downward adjustment of credit ratings after M&A to finance risky acquisitions with bond issuances, and (ii) increased market share affecting competitors’ employment and investment, but (iii) suffered severe downgrades at the onset of the pandemic.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000923

We find that especially funds that score high on traditional skill measures exhibit a liquidity-based trading venue preference. We identify an informed trading motive as the most likely driver for such behaviour rather than preference based on geographic, economic, cultural, or governance motives. Thus, liquidity picking is associated with fund outperformance and stock selection ability that is not limited to only cross-listed firms.

New cross-country data shows 49 countries adopted OB policies, privacy preferences predict policy adoption, and adoption spurs fintech entry. UK microdata shows that OB enables: (i) consumers to access both financial advice and credit; (ii) SMEs to establish new lending relationships.

Using regulatory filings, we find that hedge funds reduced arbitrage activities and increased cash holdings, despite stable credit and low contemporaneous redemptions. Creditors’ regulatory and liquidity constraints were not propagated to hedge funds through repo—Treasury arbitrageurs’ predominant financing source. Fund-creditor borrowing data reveal more regulated dealers provided, and more important clients received, disproportionately higher funding. Value-at-risk reported by funds suggests internal risk constraints were binding.

Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Innovation and capital,"Daniel C. Fehder, Naomi Hausman and Yael V. Hochberg","Using a regime change in the commercialization of university innovation in 1980 that strongly increased university incentives to patent and license discoveries, we document that an increase in the supply of commercializable innovation attracts venture capital investment to the region. The Bayh-Dole Act shifted ownership of intellectual property stemming from federally-funded research from the federal government to universities, spurring technology transfer into the local area. Because universities have different technological strengths, each local area surrounding a university experienced an increase after 1980 in commercializable innovation relevant to particular sets of industries which differed widely across university counties. Comparing industries within a county that were more versus less related to the local university's innovative strengths, we show that venture capital dollars after 1980 flowed systematically towards geographic areas and industries affected most by the sudden influx of commercializable innovation from universities. These results persist even when controlling for ex ante geographic and industry distributions of corporate patenting and prior venture financing. The findings support the notion that increased supply of commercializable innovation serves to draw private capital investment to a region.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000376
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Payments and privacy in the digital economy,"Toni Ahnert, Peter Hoffmann and Cyril Monnet","We propose a model of lending, payments choice, and privacy in the digital economy. While digital payments enable merchants to sell goods online, they reveal information to their lender. Cash guarantees anonymity, but limits distribution to less efficient offline venues. In equilibrium, merchants trade off the efficiency gains from online distribution (with digital payments) and the informational rents from staying anonymous (with cash). While new technologies can reduce the privacy concerns associated with digital payments, they also redistribute surplus from the lender to merchants. Hence, privacy enhancements do not always improve welfare.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000583

Markups cannot measure competition, because most data products’ marginal cost is zero, making the markup infinite. Yet, data monopolists may not exert monopoly power because they cannot commit to restricting data sales to future customers. This limited commitment and strategic substitutability of data undermine sellers’ monopoly power. But data subscriptions restore this monopoly power. Evidence from online data markets supports the model’s insight that subscriptions indicate market power. Model and evidence reveal that data subscriptions are better for consumers because they sustain the incentive to invest in high-quality data.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000613
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Collateral value uncertainty and mortgage credit provision,Erica Xuewei Jiang and Anthony Lee Zhang,"Houses with higher value uncertainty receive less mortgage credit: mortgages backed by these houses are more likely to be rejected, have higher interest rates, and have lower loan-to-price ratios. The relationship between house value uncertainty and credit availability is driven partly by a classic channel in which uncertainty lowers debt recovery rates, and partly by a novel channel where more uncertain appraisals make regulatory constraints on loan size more likely to bind. We build a structural model to quantify the effects of each channel, and show how a shift toward computerized asset appraisals could influence credit access.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000625

Using data from the UK mortgage market and a structural model of screening with endogenous menus, this paper quantifies the impact of asymmetric information on equilibrium contracts and welfare. Counterfactual simulations show that, because of the externality, there is too much screening along the loan-to-value dimension.

Journal of Financial Economics,2025,The return of return dominance: Decomposing the cross-section of prices,"Ricardo Delao, Xiao Han and Sean Myers","What explains cross-sectional dispersion in stock valuation ratios? We find that 75% of dispersion in price–earnings ratios is reflected in differences in future returns, while only 25% is reflected in differences in future earnings growth. This holds at both the portfolio-level and the firm-level. We reconcile these conclusions with previous literature which has found a strong relation between prices and future profitability. Our results support models in which the cross-section of price–earnings ratios is driven mainly by discount rates or mispricing rather than future earnings growth. Evaluating six models of the value premium, we find that most models struggle to match our results; however, models with long-lived differences in risk exposure or gradual learning about parameters perform the best. The lack of earnings growth differences at long horizons provides new evidence in favor of long-run return predictability. We also show a similar dominance of predicted returns for explaining the dispersion in return surprises.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000674

Capital regulation addresses banks’ incentive for excessive leverage that dilutes depositors, but preserves some dilution to reduce bank defaults. We show theoretically that capital regulation is subject to a time inconsistency problem. In a model with non-maturing deposits where optimal withdrawals make deposits endogenously long-term, we find commitment to have important effects on the optimal level and cyclicality of capital adequacy.

Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Trust as an entry barrier: Evidence from FinTech adoption,Keer Yang,"This paper studies the role of trust in incumbent lenders (banks) as an entry barrier to emerging FinTech lenders in credit markets. The empirical setting exploits the outbreak of the Wells Fargo scandal as a negative shock to borrowers’ trust in banks. Using a difference-in-differences framework, I find that increased exposure to the Wells Fargo scandal leads to an increase in the probability of borrowers using FinTech as mortgage originators. Utilizing political affiliation to proxy for the magnitude of trust erosion in banks in a triple-differences specification, I find that, conditional on the same exposure to the scandal, a county experiencing a greater erosion of trust has a larger increase in FinTech share relative to a county experiencing less of an erosion of trust. Estimating treatment effect heterogeneity using generic machine learning inference suggests that borrowers with the greatest decrease in trust in banks and the greatest increase in FinTech adoption have similar characteristics.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000704

The best-performing VCs, but not other managers, responded by excluding public LPs from their new funds. Lost access reduced public LP returns by $1.6 billion relative to $14 billion of their VC commitments.

Aggregate equity allocations of institutional investors decrease during periods of high volatility, both in developed and, even more strongly, in emerging markets. Our granular portfolio-level data allows us to uncover disaggregated investor responses that are an order of magnitude larger than aggregate estimates, and are dominated by discretionary (investor-driven) component of flows. We further show that periods of high volatility are associated with portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors from small-cap to large-cap stocks. Finally, institutional flows have significant impact on future firm stability, measured by their volatility and liquidity.

Conklin, Kristopher Gerardi and Lauren Lambie-Hanson","We document large racial disparities in the ability of homeowners to access their accumulated housing wealth. Minority homeowners are significantly more likely to have their mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) product applications rejected than White homeowners, and the unconditional disparities are significantly larger than those found in prior studies that focused on purchase and rate/term refinance loans. Had Black homeowners faced the same MEW denial rate as White homeowners in our sample period we show they would have extracted an additional $11.2 billion in housing equity, or almost 25% of the total amount of actual equity extracted. Controlling for key underwriting variables significantly narrows the racial disparities, with the Black–White gap falling by nearly 85%, and the Hispanic-White gap falling by more than 75%. Credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are the most important factors explaining the gaps, while differences in loan-to-value ratios contribute only modestly. “Residual” disparities after conditioning on observable underwriting factors are large and vary significantly across lenders. A battery of tests suggests that differences in unobserved underwriting factors are unlikely to fully explain the residual disparities, which tend to be larger in geographic areas characterized by more racial animus.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000467

To quantify their real effects, we develop a dynamic investment model, incorporating both the demand and supply sides of capital. Strong investor demand relaxes financial constraints and facilitates equity issuance and investment, while weak demand encourages opportunistic share repurchases, crowding out investment. We estimate the model using indirect inference, matching the endogenous relationship between investor demand and firm policies.

Based on the key differences between banks and fintechs, we derive results consistent with the empirical evidence available. We find that fintechs with inferior monitoring efficiency can successfully enter because of their superior flexibility in pricing and that higher bank concentration leads to higher fintech loan volume. If fintechs and banks have similar funding costs, fintech borrowers pay lower loan rates and have higher default rates than bank borrowers with similar characteristics; however, the result will flip if fintechs have much higher funding costs than banks. The advantage of fintechs in offering convenience can also induce them to charge higher loan rates than banks. Fintech entry will improve welfare if fintechs have high monitoring efficiency and inter-fintech competition intensity is intermediate. Fintech entry may induce banks’ exit and reduce investment; however, it will increase investment if inter-fintech competition is intense enough.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000480

Most retail brokers route to multiple wholesalers and actively monitor their performance, rewarding those offering lower execution costs with more volume. While retail investors benefit from the current landscape across all stocks, those trading small stocks benefit the most.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000595
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Understanding the strength of the dollar,"Zhengyang Jiang, Robert J. Richmond and Tony Zhang","We attribute variation in the strength of the U.S. dollar and its covariance with other currencies to economic primitives using a global asset demand system. We take global investor savings, asset supply, and monetary policy as exogenous primitives, and show how these variables explain dollar exchange rate behavior. Prior to the global financial crisis, global savings and demand shifts explain dollar depreciation, whereas post-crisis they explain dollar appreciation. Interest rates and cross-border bank loans explain short-term fluctuations in the dollar, but decline in significance over longer horizons. When explaining the dollar factor structure, we find that global savings explain common variations across dollar exchange rates, whereas investor demand shifts account for cross-sectional heterogeneity in dollar betas.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000601

Countries digitize their currencies–by upgrading existing or launching new payment systems (including CBDCs)–to compete with foreign fiat currencies and private digital money. A pecking order emerges: less dominant currencies digitize earlier, reflecting a first-mover advantage; dominant currencies delay digitization until they face competition; the weakest currencies forgo digitization. However, delayed digitization allows private digital money to gain widespread adoption, eventually weakening fiat money’s role. We highlight how geopolitical considerations, stablecoins, and interoperability between fiat and private digital money shape the dynamics of currency competition.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000637

Exploiting the ECB's tiered reserve remuneration system for identification, we show that this system encouraged banks with low reserve holdings to obtain more reserves through the money market.

Comparing forecasts from multiple models, we find that the popular martingale model performs worst. Using the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) to judge model performance, ARMA(1,1) models perform the best for about 46% of the firms in out-of-sample tests. The ARMA(1,1) model delivers an average RMSE that is statistically significantly lower than all alternative models, and also performs well when not the very best. Its forecasts reverse large, unexpected shocks to realized variances. When using this model to revisit the relation between idiosyncratic risk and returns (the IVOL puzzle), we fail to find a significant relation. The IVOL puzzle is closely connected to a very small set of observations where the martingale forecast over-predicts the future realized variance. These extreme observations are correlated with well-known firm characteristics associated with the IVOL puzzle such as poor liquidity as measured by high bid-ask spreads and the “MAX” effect.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000315

We study credit markets when intermediaries cannot commit to retention. Two structures are examined: investors lending alongside an all-equity bank and investors lending through the bank via short-term debt. With a commitment to retention, they are equivalent. Without commitment, the all-equity bank sells loans and reduces monitoring over time. Short-term debt encourages the intermediary to retain loans and incentivizes monitoring. Our analysis provides a novel mechanism for intermediaries’ reliance on short-term debt—the constant repricing of debt creates incentives that resolve the commitment problem in loan retention and monitoring.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000339

The drivers of inflation and real risks in Treasury bonds,Carolin Pflueger,"This paper shows that supply shock uncertainty interacts with the monetary policy rule to drive bond risks in a New Keynesian asset pricing model. In my model, positive nominal bond-stock betas emerge as the result of volatile supply shocks but only if the monetary policy rule features a high inflation weight. Habit formation preferences generate endogenously time-varying risk premia, explaining the volatility and predictability of bond and stock excess returns in the data, and implying that bond-stock betas price the expected equilibrium mix of shocks rather than realized shocks. The model explains the change from positive nominal and real bond-stock betas in the 1980s to negative nominal and real bond-stock betas in the 2000s with a shift from dominant supply shocks and an inflation-focused monetary policy rule, to demand shocks in the 2000s.

Drawing on a globally representative data set of currency trading volumes, we show that at times when dealers’ intermediation capacity is constrained the cost of liquidity provision increases disproportionately relative to dealer-intermediated volume. Consequently, the otherwise strong and positive relation between liquidity costs and trading volume diminishes significantly when dealers face tighter Value-at-Risk limits or higher funding costs. Using various econometric approaches, we show that this nonlinear effect of dealer constraints on market liquidity primarily stems from a reduction in the elasticity of liquidity supply, rather than changes in liquidity demand.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X25000364

These effects are robust to the degree of sophistication of agents regarding their future biases.

Armed with this measure, we find that banks managed by CEOs with higher S&L crisis exposure took on less risk and that these banks better survived the financial crisis of 2008. In particular, CEOs adjusted risk attitudes in areas causing the S&L crisis: their more intense crisis experience reduced banks’ interest rate risk, exposure to risky financial innovation and credit risk.

We study how introducing an informationally more intrusive digital payment vehicle affects households’ cash use, credit access, and welfare. A tech monopolist controls the intrusiveness of the new payment method and manipulates information asymmetries among households and oligopolistic banks to extract data contracts that are more lucrative than lending on its own.

We explain these industry polarization trends in an estimated general equilibrium model where each industry consists of large superstar oligopolists and small monopolistically competitive firms with endogenous transitions between them. Small firms make investments in speculative innovation to increase their probability of becoming superstars. Our model estimation finds that rising entry barriers in both small and superstar firms contribute to rising polarization in markups, but the rising barriers to creating small firms and increasing tastes for goods produced by superstars account for most of the divergence in Q.

We empirically corroborate our theoretical results by studying firm changes in ESG status and are unable to detect an impact of ESG divestiture strategies on the cost of capital of treated firms.

First, we provide a conceptual framework that lays out how biodiversity can be financed by pure private capital and blended financing structures. In the latter, private capital is blended with public or philanthropic capital, whose aim is to de-risk private capital investments. The main element underlying both types of financing is the “monetization” of biodiversity, that is, using investments in biodiversity to generate a financial return for private investors. Second, we provide empirical evidence using deal-level data from a leading biodiversity finance institution. Our findings are consistent with a three-dimensional efficient frontier (return, risk, and biodiversity impact)—deals with a favorable risk-return profile tend to be financed by pure private capital, whereas for other deals the biodiversity impact needs to be sufficiently large for blended finance to be used. Overall, our results suggest that blended finance is an important tool for improving the risk-return profile of these projects, thereby increasing their appeal to private investors and crowding in private capital.

JAQ can be constructed from any employer–employee data set including workers’ occupations, and used to explore research questions in corporate finance and organization economics.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24002150
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Robustness and dynamic sentiment,"Pascal J. Maenhout, Andrea Vedolin and Hao Xing","Errors in survey expectations display waves of pessimism and optimism. This paper develops a novel theoretical framework of time-varying beliefs capturing this fact. In our model, dynamic beliefs arise endogenously due to agents’ attitude towards alternative models. Decision-maker’s distorted beliefs generate countercyclical risk aversion, procyclical portfolio weights, and countercyclical equilibrium asset returns. A calibrated version of our model is shown to jointly match salient features in survey data and equity markets.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001764
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Sustainable finance versus environmental policy: Does greenwashing justify a taxonomy for sustainable investments?,Roman Inderst and Marcus Opp,"Our paper analyzes whether a planner should design a taxonomy for sustainable investment products when conventional tools for environmental regulation can also be used to address externalities arising from firm production. We first show that the private market provision of ESG funds marketed to retail investors involves greenwashing, so that a mandatory taxonomy is necessary to generate real effects of sustainable finance. However, the introduction of such a taxonomy can only improve welfare, on top of optimally chosen environmental regulation, if financial frictions constrain socially valuable economic activity. Otherwise, environmental policy alone is sufficient to optimally address externalities.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001776
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,The moral preferences of investors: Experimental evidence,"Jean-François Bonnefon, Augustin Landier, Parinitha Sastry and David Thesmar","We characterize investors’ moral preferences in a parsimonious experimental setting, where we auction stocks with various ethical features. We find strong evidence that investors seek to align their investments with their social values (“value alignment”), and find no evidence of behavior driven by the social impact of investment decisions (“impact-seeking preferences”). First, the willingness to pay (WTP) for a stock is an increasing and quasi-linear function of corporate externalities. Second, this WTP does not change when corporate externalities are made contingent on investors buying the auctioned stock. Our results are thus compatible with a utility-maximization model where non-pecuniary benefits of firms’ externalities only accrue through stock ownership, not through the actual impact of investment decisions. Finally, the ability to directly contribute to the externality (by donating) does not reduce the willingness to pay for virtuous stocks.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001788
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Gig labor: Trading safety nets for steering wheels,"Vyacheslav Fos, Naser Hamdi, Ankit Kalda and Jordan Nickerson","Using administrative data on credit profiles matched with unemployment insurance (UI) for individuals in the U.S., we show that laid-off workers with access to Uber rely less on household debt, experience fewer delinquencies, and are less likely to apply for UI benefits. Our empirical strategy exploits both the staggered market entry of Uber across cities and the differential benefit of its entry across car owners based on car age, a key eligibility requirement of the platform. We conclude that the introduction of Uber reduced reliance on these alternative means of smoothing extreme income shocks.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X2400179X
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Information technology and lender competition,Xavier Vives and Zhiqiang Ye,"We study how information technology (IT) affects lender competition, entrepreneurs’ investment, and welfare in a spatial model. The effects of an IT improvement depend on whether it weakens the influence of lender–borrower distance on monitoring costs. If it does, it has a hump-shaped effect on entrepreneurs’ investment and social welfare. If not, competition intensity does not vary, improving lender profits, entrepreneurs’ investment, and social welfare. When entrepreneurs’ moral hazard problem is severe, IT-induced competition is more likely to reduce investment and welfare. We also find that lenders’ price discrimination is not welfare-optimal. Our results are consistent with received empirical work on lending to SMEs.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001806
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Credit supply and house prices: Evidence from mortgage market segmentation,"Manuel Adelino, Antoinette Schoar and Felipe Severino","This paper develops a difference-in-differences estimator that uses annual changes in the conforming loan limit and the 80% loan-to-value (LTV) threshold to isolate the impact of easier access to credit on house prices. Houses that become eligible for financing with an 80% LTV conforming loan increase in value by about $1.17 per square foot, controlling for a rich set of characteristics. Our estimates imply a local elasticity of house prices to interest rates below 6, which suggests that interest rates are capitalized into prices to a lesser extent than proposed by studies relying on more aggregate variation.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001818
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,From employee to entrepreneur: The role of unemployment risk,"Ai Jun Hou, Sara Jonsson, Xiaoyang Li and Qinglin Ouyang","We use Swedish administrative data to study the role of unemployment risk in salaried employees’ decisions to become entrepreneurs. Using the 2001 relaxation of Sweden’s last-in-first-out (LIFO) dismissal rule as an exogenous shock to unemployment risk, we find that employees facing increased unemployment risk are more likely to become entrepreneurs. The effect is more pronounced for employees with longer tenure, as they were newly exposed to greater unemployment risk. When we track entrepreneurs’ income dynamics and the performance of their ventures, we find that entrepreneurs who used to face greater unemployment risk do not underperform compared to other entrepreneurs. Our results provide some of the first empirical evidence of how employees respond to increased unemployment risk.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001892
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Information sharing in financial markets,"Itay Goldstein, Yan Xiong and Liyan Yang","We study information sharing between strategic investors who are informed about asset fundamentals. We demonstrate that a coarsely informed investor optimally chooses to share information if his counterparty investor is well informed. By doing so, the coarsely informed investor invites the other investor to trade against his information, thereby reducing his price impact. Paradoxically, the well informed investor loses from receiving information because of the resulting worsened market liquidity and the more aggressive trading by the coarsely informed investor. Our analysis sheds light on phenomena such as private communications among investors and public information sharing on social media.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001909
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Signals and stigmas from banking interventions: Lessons from the Bank Holiday of 1933,"Matthew Jaremski, G Gary Richardson and Angela Vossmeyer","A nationwide panic forced President Roosevelt to declare a banking holiday in March 1933. The government reopened banks sequentially using a process that sent noisy signals about banks’ health. New microdata reveals that the public responded to these signals. Deposits at rapidly reopened banks rebounded quicker than at comparable or stronger banks that reopened even a few days later. The stigma of late reopening shifted funds from stigmatized to lauded banks and among communities that they served. Despite persisting over a decade, the shift had no measurable impact on the rate at which localities recovered from the Great Depression.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001910
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Arbitrage-based recovery,Ferenc Horvath,"We develop a novel recovery theorem based on no-arbitrage principles. To implement our Arbitrage-Based Recovery Theorem empirically, one needs to observe the Arrow–Debreu prices only for one single maturity. We perform several different density tests and mean prediction tests using more than 26 years of S&P 500 options data, and we find evidence that our method can correctly recover the probability distribution of the S&P 500 index return on a monthly horizon, despite the presence of a non-trivial permanent SDF component.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001922
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,Aspirational utility and investment behavior,"Andreas Aristidou, Aleksandar Giga, Suk Lee and Fernando Zapatero","We explore the extent to which aspirations – such as those forged in the course of social interactions – explain ‘puzzling’ behavioral patterns in investment decisions. We motivate an aspirational utility, reminiscent of Friedman and Savage (1948), where social considerations (e.g., status concerns) provide an economic foundation for aspirations. We show this utility can explain a range of observed investor behaviors, such as the demand for both right- and left-skewed assets; aspects of the disposition effect; and patterns in stock-market participation consistent with empirical observations. We corroborate our theoretical findings with two novel laboratory experimental studies, where we observed participants’ preference for skewness in risky lotteries shift as lab-induced aspirations shifted.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001934
Journal of Financial Economics,2025,CEO turnover and director reputation,"Felix von Meyerinck, Jonas Romer and Markus Schmid",This paper analyzes the reputational effects of forced CEO turnovers on outside directors. We find that directors interlocked to a forced CEO turnover experience large and persistent increases in withheld votes at subsequent re-elections relative to non-turnover-interlocked directors. Directors are not penalized for an involvement in a turnover per se but for forced CEO turnovers that are related to governance failures by the board. Our results challenge the widespread view that forcing out a CEO can generally be understood as a sign of a well-functioning corporate governance.,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001946
