The Review of Financial Studies,2022,New Perspectives on Insurance,Ralph S J Koijen and Motohiro Yogo,"This special issue originates from a dual submission conference with the NBER Insurance Working Group and the Corporate Finance Program in 2020. It brings a broader perspective on important frictions in insurance markets, including trust between insurers and policyholders, conflicts of interest among brokers, suboptimal policyholder behavior, and risk-based capital regulation. Several developments in the economy and the academic literature have provided an impetus for new perspectives, including the growth of savings products with minimum return guarantees, the global financial crisis, and intermediary asset pricing. We conclude with an overview of research questions that are promising for further exploration.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhac063
The Review of Financial Studies,2022,Trust and Insurance Contracts,"Nicola Gennaioli, Rafael La Porta, Florencio Lopez- de-Silanes and Andrei Shleifer","We assemble homeowner insurance claims from 28 independently operated country subsidiaries of a multinational insurance firm. We propose a new insurance model, in which consumers can make invalid claims and firms can deny valid claims, as is common in the data. In the model, trust and honesty shape equilibrium insurance contracts, disputes, and claim payments, especially when disputes are too small for courts. We test the model by investigating claim incidence, dispute, rejection, and payment, as well as insurance costs and pricing across countries. The evidence is consistent with the centrality of trust for insurance markets, as our model predicts.Authors have furnished data/code, which are available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab112
The Review of Financial Studies,2022,Conflicting Interests and the Effect of Fiduciary Duty: Evidence from Variable Annuities,"Mark Egan, Shan Ge and Johnny Tang","We examine the variable annuity market to study conflicts of interest and the effect of fiduciary duty in brokerage markets. Insurers typically pay brokers higher commissions for selling more expensive annuities. Our results indicate that sales are four times as sensitive to brokers’ interests as to investors’. To limit conflicts of interest, the Department of Labor proposed a rule in 2016 holding brokers to a fiduciary standard. We find that after the proposal, sales of high-expense products fell by 52 as sales became more sensitive to expenses. Based on our structural estimates, investor welfare improved overall.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhac047
The Review of Financial Studies,2022,Can Risk Be Shared across Investor Cohorts? Evidence from a Popular Savings Product,Johan Hombert and Victor Lyonnet,"We study how retail savings products can share market risk across investor cohorts, thereby completing financial markets. Financial intermediaries smooth returns by varying reserves, which are passed on between successive investor cohorts, thereby redistributing wealth across cohorts. Using data on euro contracts sold by life insurers in France, we estimate this redistribution to be large: 0.8 of GDP. We develop and provide evidence for a model in which low investor sophistication, while leading to individually suboptimal decisions, improves risk sharing by allowing intercohort risk sharing.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhac054
The Review of Financial Studies,2022,Regulatory Forbearance in the U.S. Insurance Industry: The Effects of Removing Capital Requirements for an Asset Class,"Bo Becker, Marcus Opp and Farzad Saidi","We analyze the effects of a reform of capital regulation for U.S. insurance companies in 2009. The reform eliminates capital buffers against unexpected losses associated with portfolio holdings of MBS, but not for other fixed-income assets. After the reform, insurance companies are much more likely to retain downgraded MBS compared to other downgraded assets. This pattern is more pronounced for financially constrained insurers. Exploiting discontinuities in the reform’s implementation, we can identify the relevance of the capital requirements channel. We also document that the insurance industry crowds outs other investors in the new issuance of (high-yield) MBS.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab102

We present a model in the context of the U.S. life insurance industry in which the regulatory framework incentivizes value-maximizing insurers to hedge variable annuity (VA) guarantees, though imperfectly, and shifts risks into high-risk and illiquid bonds. We calibrate the model to insurer-level data and identify the VA-induced changes in insurers’ risk exposures. In the event of major asset and guarantee shocks and absent regulatory intervention, these shared exposures exacerbate system-wide fire sales to maintain capital ratios, plausibly erasing over half of insurers’ equity capital.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhac056
The Review of Financial Studies,2022,Unemployment Insurance as a Subsidy to Risky Firms,"Bernardus Van Doornik, Dimas Fazio, David Schoenherr and Janis Skrastins","We document that a more generous unemployment insurance (UI) system shifts labor supply from safer to riskier firms and reduces the compensating wage differentials that risky firms need to pay. Consequently, a more generous UI system increases risky firms’ value and fosters entrepreneurship by reducing new firms’ labor costs. Exploiting a UI reform in Brazil that affects only part of the workforce allows us to compare labor supply for workers with different degrees of UI protection within the same firm, sharpening the identification of the results. Altogether, our results suggest that UI provides a transfer system from safe to risky firms.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhac013

We show that most of the increase substituted for a reduction in bank lending. In counties in which banks had a larger market share before the crisis, finance companies and FinTech lenders increased their lending more. We find no effect of reduced bank lending on employment, wages, and new business creation by 2016.

Two-thirds of such nonbank lending can be attributed to bank regulations that constrain banks’ ability to lend to unprofitable and highly levered borrowers. Firms with negative EBITDA and debt/EBITDA greater than six are 32 and 15 more likely to borrow from nonbanks. These firms pay significantly higher interest rates, especially following the 2013 leveraged loan guidance revisions.

We provide evidence of the heterogeneous impact of two shocks to the supply of mortgage credit: postcrisis regulatory burden and GSE financing cost changes. Small banks exploit regulation disproportionately affecting the largest four banks (Big4) and their ability to lend on balance sheet to strongly substitute for the retreating Big4. The erasure of guarantee fee (g-fee) discounts for large lenders facilitates small bank growth in GSE lending.

Competition from FinTech payment providers disrupts this information spillover. The bank’s price for payment services and its loan offers are affected. FinTech competition promotes financial inclusion, may hurt consumers with a strong bank preference, and has an ambiguous effect on the loan market. Both FinTech data sales and consumer data portability increase bank lending, but the effects on consumer welfare are ambiguous.

While excessive risk-taking could plausibly explain the boom-to-bust cycle, many investors do not anticipate increasing risk. We show that credit booms may be misunderstood as being driven by high productivity because opaque bank assets disguise risk incentives. Balanced funding relative to productive prospects can sustain prudent lending (good boom), whereas funding imbalances may induce high risk exposure and boost asset prices (bad boom) or lead to asset underpricing and insufficient lending (missed boom). Rational agents drawing inference from prices make mistakes that can amplify the effect of funding imbalances and propagate risk.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhac014

Individual MAI tend to increase around related announcements and following changes in related fundamentals. Further, bad news raises attention more than good news. For unemployment and FOMC, attention predicts announcement risk premiums and implied volatility changes with large economic magnitudes. Our findings support theories of endogenous attention and announcement risk premiums, while demonstrating future research directions, including that announcements can raise new concerns.

We hypothesize that the visual salience of adjacent prices increases the decision weights on returns computed from those prices. We analyze the inferred impact of these weights in two experimental studies that use either historical price charts or simpler artificial sequences. We find that decision weights derived from visual salience are associated with experimental investments.

Yet real-world frictions can violate this equality and create apparently high Sharpe ratio opportunities. We develop new methods for asset pricing with cross-sectional heterogeneity in compensation for risk. We extend k-means clustering to group assets by risk prices and introduce a formal test for whether differences in risk premiums across market segments are too large to occur by chance.

For most market participants, the no-arbitrage relation holds fairly well when implemented using marginal funding costs and risk-free investment instruments. However, a few high-rated banks do enjoy CIP-arbitrage opportunities. Dealers avert inventory imbalances stemming from lower-rated banks’ usage of FX swaps to obtain dollar funding by inducing opposite (arbitrage) flows from high-rated banks. Arbitrage trades are difficult to scale, however, because funding costs increase as soon as arbitrageurs increase positions.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhac026

We examine a model in which a CRA’s rating is followed by a market for credit risk that provides a public signal – the price.

We develop and estimate a model of acquiring innovation under information frictions, featuring endogenous merger, innovation, and offer composition decisions. Our estimates suggest that acquirers’ due diligence reveals only 30 of private information possessed by targets.

The R&D response is entirely driven by those high-pollution firms most affected by emissions taxes. Pollution taxes increase the marginal value of R&D spending in polluting firms, even when this spending does not lead to new innovation. Pollution taxes have the strongest effect on R&D investment in sectors in which new invention is difficult to appropriate and outside knowledge is easier to acquire, suggesting an important reason dirty firms invest in R&D is to expand their capacity to absorb external knowledge and technical know-how.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhac003

A simple intermediary-based model with partial market segmentation accounts for intermediary factors’ explanatory power and delivers three further implications with empirical support. First, whereas bond sorts on risk-related variables produce monotonic loading patterns on intermediary factors, non-risk-related sorts produce no pattern.

In meeting redemptions, funds followed a pecking order by first selling their liquid assets, including Treasuries and high-quality corporate bonds, which generated the most concentrated selling pressure in these markets.

Furthermore, there has been a major repricing of unsecured consumer credit risk since the 2007–2009 financial crisis.

First, we build a dynamic housing market model and show that belief heterogeneity can reconcile prior mixed evidence on flood risk capitalization. Second, we implement a door-to-door survey in Rhode Island, finding significant flood risk underestimation and sorting based on risk perceptions and amenity values. Third, we estimate that coastal prices exceed fundamentals by 6-13 in our benchmark area, with potentially higher overvaluation in other locations. Finally, we quantify both allocative inefficiency and distributional consequences arising from flood risk misperceptions and insurance policy reform.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab122

We use disaggregated survey data on bond returns and document large disagreement in the cross-sectional distribution and persistence in forecast accuracy. Our aggregate subjective belief proxy outperforms equal weighting schemes, and its dynamics are significantly different from statistical forecasting models. With this measure in hand, we study the relationship between quantities of risk and subjective expectations of excess returns and demonstrate a strong link between the two, even if such a relationship is difficult to detect using realized returns.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab115

Moreover, the debt-to-GDP ratio is positively associated with yield spreads. I rationalize these facts in a model in which positive shocks to government debt cause lower inflation and growth, making bonds attractive assets. Furthermore, because longer-term bonds are less exposed to current debt shock than are shorter-term bonds, they are better hedges, resulting in high yield spreads in high-debt states.

By increasing the opportunity cost of postponing the realization of losses, leverage constraints improve traders’ market timing and reduce their disposition effect. We replicate these findings in two distinct experimental settings, further isolating the mechanism and demonstrating generality of the results. The interaction between constraints and behavioral biases has implications for policy and choice architecture.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab073

The model generates a novel mechanism for volume: because of the interaction between extrapolative beliefs and disposition effects, investors are quick to not only buy assets with positive past returns but also sell them if good returns continue. Using account-level transaction data on the 2014–2015 Chinese stock market bubble, we test and confirm the model’s predictions about trading volume. We quantify the magnitude of the proposed mechanism and show that it can increase trading volume by another 30.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab070

Guided by an international CAPM with leverage constraints, we use observed stock prices to measure the variation in the magnitude and the implicit cost of such cross-border funding barriers. Our measure helps explain the dynamics of global market integration and, in particular, its reversals documented in the literature, but not explained by other international investment barriers. We confirm our results using alternative financial integration measures, international capital flows, and institutional portfolio holdings.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab009
The Review of Financial Studies,2022,Cross-Border Bank Flows and Monetary Policy,"Ricardo Correa, Teodora Paligorova, Horacio Sapriza and Andrei Zlate","We analyze the impact of monetary policy on cross-border bank flows for a large sample of countries over two decades. We find evidence in favor of a cross-border risk-taking channel, as the monetary policy stance of source countries is an important determinant of cross-border bank flows. A relatively tighter monetary policy in source countries prompts banks to reallocate their lending toward safer foreign counterparties. The cross-border reallocation of credit is more pronounced for source countries with lower-capitalized banks. Also, the reallocation is directed toward foreign borrowers in relatively safer destinations, such as advanced economies or economies with investment-grade sovereign ratings.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab019
The Review of Financial Studies,2022,Regressive Mortgage Credit Redistribution in the Post-Crisis Era,Francesco D’Acunto and Alberto G Rossi,"We document four secular trends about U.S. mortgage origination by traditional and FinTech lenders after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. First, since 2011, the overall number, size, and approval rate of small and medium-sized loans have been decreasing over time, relative to large loans. Second, the largest lenders redistribute their lending the most. Third, this loan-size redistribution of credit increases in the size of the lender. Fourth, the effects are stronger for mortgages further away from the conforming loan limit(s) in both directions. We argue that the supply of credit drives these secular trends, and we assess several potential economic mechanisms.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhab008
