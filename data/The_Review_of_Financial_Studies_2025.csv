The Review of Financial Studies,2025,Near-Rational Equilibria in Heterogeneous-Agent Models: A Verification Method,Leonid Kogan and Indrajit Mitra,"We propose a general simulation-based procedure for estimating the quality of approximate policies in heterogeneous-agent equilibrium models, which allows us to verify that such approximate solutions describe a near-rational equilibrium. Our procedure endows agents with superior knowledge of the future path of the economy, while imposing a suitable penalty for such foresight. The relaxed problem is more tractable than the original, and results in an upper bound on agents’ welfare. Our method applies to various solution algorithms. We illustrate our approach in two applications: the incomplete-markets model of Krusell and Smith (1998) and the heterogeneous firm model of Khan and Thomas (2008).",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaf030
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,In Safe Hands: The Financial and Real Impact of Investor Composition over the Credit Cycle,Antonio Coppola,"I show that investor composition affects bond price dynamics and capital allocation during crises. Using large-scale holdings data and within-firm ownership variation across near-identical bonds, I causally identify bond returns’ investor composition elasticities. Corporate bonds held predominantly by insurers rather than mutual funds suffer milder losses in downturns: increasing insurer holdings by half a bond’s size causes 20% shallower drawdowns. A shift-share instrument isolates variation from large insurers’ idiosyncratic primary-market allocations. Differences in intermediaries’ liability structures drive these results, which hold across countries. During crises, firms with more stable bondholders maintain higher borrowing at lower cost and invest more.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaf017
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,Who Holds Sovereign Debt and Why It Matters,"Xiang Fang, Bryan Hardy and Karen K Lewis","This paper studies whether investor composition affects the sovereign debt market. We construct a data set of sovereign debt holdings by foreign and domestic bank, nonbank private and official investors for 101 countries across three decades. Compared with other investors, private nonbank investors absorb a disproportionate share of the debt supply, and their demand for emerging market debt is most price responsive. A counterfactual analysis of emerging market sovereigns shows a 10% increase in debt leads to a 5.8% yield increase but an outsized 8.4% increase without nonbank investors. We conclude that sovereigns are vulnerable to the loss of nonbanks.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaf031
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,Is Capital Structure Irrelevant with ESG Investors?,Peter Feldhütter and Lasse Heje Pedersen,"This paper examines whether capital structure is irrelevant for enterprise value and investment when investors care about environmental, social, and governance issues, which we refer to as “ESG-Modigliani-Miller” (ESG-MM). Theoretically, we show that ESG-MM holds with linear pricing and additive ESG. ESG-MM means that issuing low-yielding green bonds does not lower the overall cost of capital because it makes the issuer’s other securities browner. Hence, a firm’s incentive to make a green investment does not depend on its financing choice. We provide suggestive evidence of failure of ESG-MM, implying that firms and governments can exploit inconsistent ESG attribution or segmented markets.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae059
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,An Intermediation-Based Model of Exchange Rates,"Semyon Malamud, Andreas Schrimpf and Yuan Zhang","We develop a continuous-time general equilibrium model with intermediaries at the heart of international financial markets. Global intermediaries bargain with households and extract rents from providing access to foreign claims. By tilting state prices, intermediaries’ market power breaks monetary neutrality and makes international risk-sharing inefficient. Despite having zero net positions, markups charged by intermediaries significantly distort international asset prices, affecting exchange rate dynamics and their response to shocks. Our model can reproduce patterns consistent with several well-known exchange rate puzzles, such as deviations from uncovered and covered interest parity. All equilibrium quantities are derived in closed form, allowing us to pin down the underlying economic mechanisms explicitly.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaf037

Examining more than 20 years of evidence from the Robert Shiller Investor Confidence surveys, we find that investors’ higher-order beliefs provide substantial motivations for nonfundamental speculation—taking a stock market position that conflicts with one’s valuation of the market. To explore the equilibrium implications, we construct a model that matches the survey evidence and highlights that investors’ higher-order beliefs amplify stock market overreaction and excess volatility.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaf019

We compare completed and withdrawn IPO attempts. We instrument the decision to complete the IPO using prior market returns. After instrumenting, we isolate a positive causal effect of going public on profitability. We also find a post-IPO expansion in sales per employee, subsidiaries, and countries in which firms operate. Overall, our results are consistent with going public relaxing financial constraints and inducing a shift in strategy towards increased commercialization.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaf026

We study competition between heterogeneously informed insurers, showing that their information may or may not be revealed in equilibrium. We find that all equilibria are profitable and that noninformative equilibria entail risk pooling and possibly efficiency.

We study a tractable model with proportional transaction costs where agents trade a derivative with nonlinear payoffs to hedge nontraded endowments. We show that trade is sustained in an equilibrium with transaction costs only if there is sufficient heterogeneity in risk aversion. When there is trade, the equilibrium return variance increases in transaction costs. These results are driven by how mean-variance demands, hedging demands, and asymmetry of no-transaction region widths determine the equilibrium Sharpe ratio and return volatility when transaction costs change.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhaf023

Employing a difference-in-differences strategy, I find that the arrival of centralized futures markets improves price transparency and risk management in the underlying product market: price dispersion decreases and steel producers increase their hedging activity. Moreover, market share is reallocated toward low-cost producers, while product prices, producers’ profits, and valuations decrease.

Headquarters contract with division managers to induce effort. Uncertainty creates endogenous disagreement, thereby aggravating moral hazard. By hedging uncertainty, headquarters design incentive contracts that reduce disagreement and lower incentive provision costs, thereby promoting effort. Because hedging uncertainty can conflict with hedging risk, optimal contracts differ from those in standard principal-agent models.

Individuals overremember positive investment outcomes of chosen assets and underremember negative ones. Based on their memories, subjects form overly optimistic beliefs about their investment, reinvest too much, and become overconfident about their investment ability relative to others. We further provide evidence on motivation driving the memory bias. This positive memory bias offers a cognitive microfoundation for why gains weight more than losses when people learn from experiences.

I exploit rigid earnings announcement schedules to identify which firms are associated in investors’ memory. Firms with randomly overlapping earnings announcements are associated in memory because many investors experience them in the same context. Months later, when only one of the two firms announces earnings, this context is cued, and triggers the recall of the other, associated firm. On such days, I find that memory-induced attention leads to buying pressure in the associated firm’s stock.

Subjects observe the time series of a risky asset and a signal that, in random rounds, helps predict returns. Subjects form extrapolative forecasts following a signal they perceive as useless, and their investment decisions underreact to their beliefs. If the same subjects perceive the signal as predictive, they rationally use it in their forecasts, they no longer extrapolate, and they rely significantly more on their forecasts when making risk allocations.

These correlations offset, consistent with the well-known near-zero unconditional autocorrelation, yet they are pervasive, present across industries and countries.

The economic magnitude of the return-adjustment produced by IPCA is impressive: even before transaction costs, the average IPCA alpha of 46 long-short trading strategies constructed on previously discovered signals, is close to zero and contrasts with average realized returns of over 80 basis points per month.

The model generates significantly better pricing performance than existing bottom-up models.

While private firms need incentives to implement projects well, governments need incentives to limit expropriation. This double moral hazard limits the willingness of outside investors to fund infrastructure projects. Optimal financing contracts involve government guarantees to investors against project failure to incentivize the government to agree not to expropriate, thus improving private sector incentives and project quality.

This liquidity management practice can transmit non-fundamental fund flow shocks onto Treasuries, generating excess return volatility. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that Treasury excess return volatility is positively associated with bond fund ownership, and this pattern is more pronounced among funds conducting intensive liquidity management. Causal evidence is provided by exploiting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2017 Liquidity Risk Management Rule. Evidence also suggests that the COVID-19 Treasury market turmoil was attributed to intensified liquidity management, an unintended consequence of the 2017 Liquidity Risk Management Rule.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae082
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,Deconstructing the Yield Curve,Richard Crump and Nikolay Gospodinov,"We introduce a novel nonparametric bootstrap for the yield curve that is agnostic to the true factor structure of interest rates. We deconstruct the yield curve into primitive objects, with weak cross-sectional and time-series dependence, that serve as building blocks for resampling the data. We analyze the properties of the bootstrap for mimicking salient features of the data and conducting valid inference. We demonstrate the benefits of our general method by revisiting the predictability of bond returns based on slow-moving fundamentals. We find that trend inflation, but not the equilibrium real rate, has predictive power for future bond returns.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae077
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,Gold’s Value as an Investment,Urban Jermann,"This paper presents an approach for pricing gold from investors’ perspective. The model is based on no-arbitrage principles with minimal structural assumptions. There is no need to specify investor preferences. When fitted to match 10-year real U.S. Treasury rates, the model can replicate the salient fluctuations in the time series of gold prices since 2007. The model is also able to capture key patterns of CME Comex gold futures prices. The model implies that the majority of the value of gold is due to its role as an investment asset.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae076
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,War Discourse and Disaster Premium: 160 Years of Evidence from the Stock Market,"David Hirshleifer, Dat Mai and Kuntara Pukthuanthong","Using a semisupervised topic model on 7 million New York Times articles spanning 160 years, we test whether topics of media discourse predict future stock market excess returns to test rational and behavioral hypotheses about market valuation of disaster risk. Media discourse data address the challenge of sample size even when disasters are rare. Our methodology avoids look-ahead bias and addresses semantic shifts. Our discourse topics positively predicts market excess returns, with War having an out-of-sampleof 1.35%. We call this effect the war return premium. The war return premium has increased in more recent time periods.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae081
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,Corporate Loan Spreads and Economic Activity,"Anthony Saunders, Alessandro Spina, Sascha Steffen and Daniel Streitz","We investigate the predictive power of loan spreads for forecasting business cycles, specifically focusing on more constrained, intermediary-reliant firms. We introduce a novel loan-market-based credit spread constructed using secondary corporate loan-market prices over the 1999 to 2023 period. Loan spreads significantly enhance the prediction of macroeconomic outcomes, outperforming other credit-spread indicators. We also explore the underlying mechanisms and differentiate between borrower fundamentals and financial frictions. Evidence suggests that supply-side frictions are a decisive factor in the forecasting ability of loan spreads.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae084
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,House Prices and Rents,Eugene F Fama and Kenneth R French,"Variation in monthly metro area house prices unrelated to expected rents clouds the information about future rents in price-rent ratios and lagged changes in house prices. The variation in house prices unrelated to expected rents is, however, correlated across areas, and the problem is mitigated by measuring rent growth regression variables net of their monthly cross-section (across-area) means. This control for price variation unrelated to expected rents substantially enhances the information about future rents that we extract from price-rent ratios and lagged changes in house prices.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae065
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,The Effects of Macroeconomic Shocks: Household Financial Distress Matters,"José Mustre-del-Río, Juan M Sánchez, Ryan Mather and Kartik Athreya","When a macroeconomic shock arrives, variation in household balance sheet health (captured by the presence of financial distress, or “FD”) leads to differential access to credit and hence a distribution in consumption responses. As we document, though, over the past two recessions, households in prior FD also experienced macroeconomic shocks more intensely than others, leading to a distribution of shock severity. Quantifying the importance of each dimension of heterogeneity (FD or shock severity) for consumption requires a structural model. We find that heterogeneity in FD matters more for shaping the responses of individual and aggregate consumption to shocks.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae058
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,The Hedging Channel of Exchange Rate Determination,Gordon Y Liao and Tony Zhang,"We propose the currency hedging channel that connects countries’ external imbalances to their exchange rate behavior. We present a model in which investors increase their currency hedging during periods of financial distress in proportion to their net foreign asset exposure. This behavior coupled with constrained financial intermediation explains observed relationships between gradually adjusting external imbalances and volatile spot and forward exchange rates. We find empirical support for the hedging channel in both the conditional and unconditional moments of exchange rates, option prices, and countries’ uses of Federal Reserve swap lines.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae072
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,Real Consequences of Shocks to Intermediaries Supplying Corporate Hedging Instruments,Hyeyoon Jung,"I show that shocks to financial intermediaries supplying hedging instruments to corporations have real effects. I exploit a quasi-natural experiment in South Korea in 2010, where regulations required banks to hold enough capital for taking foreign exchange derivatives (FXD) positions. Using variation in exposure to this regulation across banks, I find that the regulation caused a reduction in FXD supply, leading to a significant decline in exports for firms contracting derivatives with more exposed banks. Results indicate the crucial role of intermediaries in allocating risks through derivatives provision and establish a causal relationship between financial hedging and real economic outcomes.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae066
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,"Long-Term Investors, Demand Shifts, and Yields",Kristy A E Jansen,"I exploit a Dutch reform in the regulatory discount curve that makes the liabilities of pension funds and insurance companies (P&Is) more sensitive to changes in 20-year interest rates but less so to longer maturity rates. Following the reform, P&Is reduced their longest maturity bond holdings but increased those with 20-year maturities, steepening the long end of the yield curve. Using the reform as a shock to identify price elasticities of demand at the sector level based on holdings across maturity buckets and time, I show that banks are more price elastic than other investors and absorb demand shocks.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae071
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,Duration-Based Valuation of Corporate Bonds,"Jules H  van Binsbergen, Yoshio Nozawa and Michael Schwert","We decompose corporate bond and equity index returns into duration-matched government bond returns and the excess returns over this duration-matched counterfactual, which we term duration-adjusted returns. Compared with previously used excess return definitions (ie, returns in excess of Treasury bills), our decomposition leads to markedly different return patterns and asset pricing implications. In particular, we find that investment-grade bonds earn a small credit risk premium, comparable in magnitude to the convenience yield, and that duration adjustment resolves the CAPM’s failure to price corporate bonds. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting for nonstationary interest rate environments in asset pricing tests.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae054
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,"Capital Investment, Equity Returns, and Aggregate Dynamics in Oligopolistic Production Economies",Hitesh Doshi and Praveen Kumar,"We analyze effects of tacit collusion in a dynamic general equilibrium model of oligopolistic sectors with capital investment and real frictions. Through their effects on equilibrium- and off-equilibrium stock prices, fundamental shocks affect incentives for defection from tacit collusion, amplifying the interaction between the real economy and financial markets as well as firms’ risk exposure. The model implies ambiguous relationship between industry concentration and equity returns depending on operating leverage, which helps reconcile conflicting evidence in the literature. We find quantitative and empirical support for novel theoretical predictions regarding the effects of concentration on returns and investment.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae053
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,Dynamic Market Making with Asymmetric Information and Market Power,Wen Chen and Yajun Wang,"We study the dynamics of trading volume and bid-ask spread using a multiperiod trading model with oligopolistic market makers. Traders smooth out their trading even though they are not strategic, and thus trading persists after the arrival of information or liquidity shocks. Traders act quickly on their private information while postponing hedging trades until later periods. The market power of market makers enables them to widen bid-ask spreads when trading incentives are heightened. Consequently, both trading volume and bid-ask spread may exhibit U-shaped patterns. Our model calibration aligns with the empirical intraday patterns observed in bid-ask spreads and trading volumes. (JEL D53, D61, D82, G12, G14, G18)",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae062
The Review of Financial Studies,2025,The Brand Premium,Hamid Boustanifar and Young Dae Kang,"We highlight the limitations of using cumulative advertising expenses as an input measure of brand value. Using two output measures—Interbrand’s data and a novel text-based measure—we find that an equal-weighted portfolio of top brands yields an annual abnormal return of 3%. The excess returns are driven by companies that develop their brands internally. Intangible factors proposed in the literature have no explanatory power for the premium. Analysts underestimate the future earnings of top brands, leading to significant excess returns following earnings announcements. We find no abnormal returns associated with the input measure of brand value. (JEL G4, G12, G14, M41)",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/rfs/hhae056
