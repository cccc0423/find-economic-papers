AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Take-up of Social Benefits: Experimental Evidence from France,"Laura Castell, Marc Gurgand, Clément Imbert and Todor Tochev","We report on two nationwide experiments with job seekers in France. We first show that a meeting with social services to assess eligibility and help with applications to social benefits increased new benefit take-up by 29 percent. By contrast, an online simulator that gave personalized information on benefit eligibility did not increase take-up. Marginal treatment effects show that individuals who benefit the most from the meetings are the least likely to attend. Overall, without ruling out information frictions, our results suggest that transaction costs represent the main obstacle to applying for benefits or accessing government's assistance in applying.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220786
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Labor Supply Responses and Adjustment Frictions: A Tax-Free Year in Iceland,Jósef Sigurdsson,"Labor income earned in Iceland in 1987 went untaxed. I use this episode to study labor supply responses to temporary wage changes. Using a population-wide dataset of earnings and working time and two identification strategies, I estimate intensive and extensive margin Frisch elasticities of 0.4 and 0.09, respectively. Workers with the ability to adjust drive these average responses: extensive margin by young and close-to-retirement cohorts and intensive margin responses by workers in temporally flexible jobs, though secondary jobs contribute to one-tenth of the response. The results suggest that adjustment frictions may similarly explain differences in elasticities within and across countries.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220386
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,The Semblance of Success in Nudging Consumers to Pay Down Credit Card Debt,"Benedict Guttman-Kenney, Paul Adams, Stefan Hunt, David Laibson, Neil Stewart and Jesse Leary","We test a nudge in a field experiment on credit cards. The nudge shrouds the autopay enrollment option for cardholders to automatically pay exactly the credit card minimum payment each month. After six months, the nudge decreases the fraction of cardholders who only pay exactly the minimum by 23 percent. However, the nudge does not significantly reduce credit card debt. Nudged cardholders often choose autopay amounts that are only slightly higher than the minimum payment. The nudge reduces autopay enrollment, which increases missed payments. The nudge reduces manual payments by autopay enrollees. Cardholders frequently lacking liquid cash best explains our results.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230568
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Does Getting Forecasts Earlier Matter? Evidence from Winter Advisories and Vehicle Crashes,Vaibhav Anand,"Significant investments are directed toward improving the accuracy and early availability of forecasts. However, the value of longer lead times on forecasts is unclear. Using data on winter weather advisories and vehicle crashes in the United States, I show that advisories with longer lead times reduce crashes, even when they are less accurate than advisories with shorter lead times. Further, marginal benefits do not decrease with lead time. The benefits come from individual and institutional responses. When advisories arrive earlier, people visit fewer places, and snowplow crews intensify the road maintenance operations. These results have policy implications for providing effective forecasts.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230247
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Social Welfare Portability and Migration: Evidence from India's Public Distribution System,"Travis Baseler, Ambar Narayan, Odyssia Ng and Sutirtha Sinha Roy","This paper studies a new program designed to make food entitlements portable throughout India. We first characterize the state of food entitlement portability using mystery shoppers and surveys of migrants and distributors. We then inform households about the program—and barriers to using it—through a cluster randomized controlled trial. Treatment impacts on beliefs about entitlement portability were initially positive but later turned negative following a general rise in beliefs. These patterns are consistent with our experiment increasing awareness of the program but decreasing trust in its implementation. Migration to cities decreased, suggesting access to food affects migrants' destination choices.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20240183
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Disrupting Drug Markets: The Effects of Crackdowns on Rogue Opioid Suppliers,Adam Soliman,"This paper estimates the impact of doctor crackdowns on the quantity demanded of prescription opioids, across-market substitution, and across-product substitution. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in the timing and location of administrative actions, I find cracking down on a single doctor decreases county-level opioid dispensing by 10 percent. This decline persists across space and grows over time. Additionally, significant heroin substitution occurs, yet overall overdose mortality decreases. These results highlight a critical tradeoff policymakers should consider with targeted crackdowns: Reductions in the flow of new users must be balanced against the harm that arises when existing users substitute to more dangerous drugs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230640
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,The Not-So-Uniform Effects of Trade Secret Protection on Business Entry,Asli Leblebicioglu and Tanseli Savaşer,"We explore the consequences of trade secret protection for new business formation in the United States. We find the states that adopt the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which enhances intellectual property rights, experience an overall decline in firm and establishment entry rates. This result is driven by the reduction in the establishment entry rates of start-ups and small firms. By contrast, the law increases the establishment entry rates of incumbents and larger firms. The negative impact of the UTSA is larger in industries that rely more on intellectual assets and trade secrets, as well as external-finance-dependent industries.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220814
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,The Management of Aid and Conflict in Africa,Jacob Moscona,"This study investigates the relationship between the management of development aid and violent conflict in Africa. I exploit variation in World Bank project management quality driven by the assignment of project leaders of varying ability, combined with geo-coded data on all projects linked to performance report cards. I find that better project management reduces violent conflict across subnational aid receiving regions. Poorly managed projects increase conflict while well-managed projects do the opposite. Project monitoring is particularly important, and management matters most in regions with a recent history of warfare and for large projects that involve the transfer of appropriable resources.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220219
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Place Effects and Geographic Inequality in Health at Birth,Eric Chyn and Na'ama Shenhav,"This paper uses birth records and mothers who move to quantify the absolute and relative importance of birth location for early-life health. Using a model that includes mother and location fixed effects, we find that moving from a below- to an above-median-birth-weight location leads to important improvements in child birth weight, with comparable magnitudes to policies targeting maternal health. Place effects are larger for longer-distance moves and more influential for children of non-college-educated mothers. We find that pollution is the strongest predictor of place effects on infant health.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230011
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Local Labor Market Effects of the 2002 Bush Steel Tariffs,James Lake and Ding Liu,"President George W. Bush imposed safeguard tariffs on steel in early 2002. Using US input-output tables and a generalized difference-in-difference methodology, we analyze the local labor market employment effects of these tariffs depending on the local labor market's reliance on steel as an input and as part of local production. The tariffs did not boost local steel employment but substantially depressed local employment in steel-consuming industries for many years after Bush removed them. The tariffs also led to a persistent exit of steel-intensive manufacturing establishments, suggesting a role for plant-level fixed entry costs in translating the temporary shock into persistent outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220472
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Public Financing and Racial Disparities: Does a Rising Tide Always Lift All Boats?,Tian Qiu,"This paper studies the heterogeneous impact of local government spending across racial groups. An exogenous increase in spending results in significant improvement in White, but not Black or Hispanic, labor market outcomes such as employment rate, weekly hours worked, and labor income. These effects on adults translate into their children's academic performance. White students show significant improvement in test scores, but Black or Hispanic students do not. Consequently, the achievement racial gap widens following an increase in local government spending. These results highlight the possibility that an increase in local government spending could unexpectedly increase intergenerational racial disparity.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220480
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Do Tuition Subsidies Raise Political Participation?,Daniel Firoozi and Igor Geyn,"Civic externalities motivate education expenditures, but estimates of the civic returns to large-scale education subsidies are scarce. We use 16 million financial aid applications and a regression discontinuity (RD) design to estimate how a tuition-free college program impacts political participation. We find that each of the 2.6 million awards increased a student's voter turnout rate by 4–12 percentage points in 2020, raising total turnout and Biden's margin of victory in the awarding state. We find evidence consistent with peer socialization, among other mechanisms, and show that the civic externalities of education spending can be large enough to sway elections.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20240422
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Do Medical Treatments Work for Work? Evidence from Breast Cancer Patients,"N. Meltem Daysal, William N. Evans, Mikkel Hasse Pedersen and Mircea Trandafir","We investigate the effects of radiation therapy on the mortality and economic outcomes of breast cancer patients. We implement a 2SLS strategy within a difference-in-difference framework exploiting variation in treatment stemming from a medical guideline change in Denmark. We reproduce the results from an RCT showing the life-saving benefits of radiotherapy. We show radiation therapy also has economic returns: Ten years after diagnosis, treatment increases employment by 37 percent and earnings by 45 percent. Previous work has documented a substantial employment drop after a breast cancer diagnosis. Our results imply that radiation therapy can reduce this effect by 70 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20240133

A temporary subsidy that reduces the price of transit to zero has no significant effects on individuals' paid hours worked or earnings. Using rich administrative data, we also explore a range of other outcomes. We find suggestive evidence that transit subsidies improve measures of financial and physical health.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230460
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,The Long-Run Effects of Peer Gender on Occupational Sorting and the Wage Gap,Demid Getik and Armando N. Meier,"We study the impact of the early gender environment on inequality in the labor market. To this end, we link primary school data to occupations and earnings. We find that women exposed to more girls at critical ages earn more later on: A 10 percent increase in the share of girls leads to a gender wage gap reduction of 2.7 percent. We explore mechanisms and find a strong selection of women into less gender-stereotypical educational tracks and occupations, leading to higher earnings. The gender environment at an early age, therefore, leads to persistent changes in career trajectories and earnings.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230251
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Communication Barriers and Infant Health: The Intergenerational Effect of Randomly Allocating Refugees across Language Regions,Daniel Auer and Johannes S. Kunz,"This paper investigates the intergenerational effect of communication barriers on child health at birth. We study refugees in Switzerland who come from French- or Italian-speaking countries and who, upon arrival, are randomly allocated to different cantons in which either German, French, or Italian is the dominant language. Children born to mothers who were exogenously allocated to a region whose dominant language matches their origin language are, on average, 72 grams (or 2.2 percent) heavier. Further analyses suggest that this effect is likely driven by information about health-related behavior and services. Coethnic networks, however, can partly compensate for communication barriers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230220
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,"Transmitting Rights: Effective Cooperation, Inter-gender Contact, and Student Achievement","Sultan Mehmood, Shaheen Naseer and Daniel L. Chen","We provide experimental evidence of teacher-to-student transmission of gender attitudes in Pakistan. We randomly show teachers a pro-women's rights visual narrative. Treated teachers increase their and students' support for women's rights, unbiasedness in gender implicit association tests (IATs), and willingness to petition parliament for greater gender equality. Students improve coordination and cooperation with the opposite gender. Effects are larger when teachers teach a gender-rights curriculum. Mathematics achievement increases for classrooms assigned to form mixed-gender study groups treated with an intense program (visual narrative and curriculum), while absent in same-sex study groups. Gender attitudes are transmissible and cooperation improves student outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230620
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Fiscal Rules and the Selection of Politicians: Theory and Evidence from Italy,Matteo Gamalerio and Federico Trombetta,"Fiscal rules, or constraints on the policymaking discretion of elected officials, are widely used to regulate fiscal policies. Using data on Italian municipalities, we employ a difference-in-discontinuity design to provide evidence of the negative effect of fiscal rules on mayoral candidates' education. Municipalities in which fiscal rules meaningfully restrict the action space of politicians drive the effect. These results are consistent with a formal model of fiscal rules and political selection. We highlight that reducing discretion may affect the composition of the pool of players: It may alleviate pork barrel spending but also negatively affect the education of politicians.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220325
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Reconstruction-Era Education and Long-Run Black-White Inequality,Daniel B. Jones and Ethan Schmick,"The Reconstruction era of American history (c. 1866–1877) saw widespread efforts to educate recently freed people—efforts that were partially curtailed after Reconstruction. This paper examines the impact of childhood exposure to educational opportunity during Reconstruction on later-life outcomes for recently freed people. Using data on the number of teachers in Black schools and a linked census sample, we find that Black children exposed to greater educational opportunity during Reconstruction had improved occupational standing as adults. Their sons also experienced gains, suggesting that Reconstruction-era educational efforts, had they persisted, would have impacted Black-White gaps into the twentieth century.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230125
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,HBCU Enrollment and Longer-Term Outcomes,"Ashley Edwards, Justin Ortagus, Jonathan Smith and Andria Smythe","Using data from nearly 1.2 million Black SAT takers, we find that students initially enrolling in a historically Black college and university (HBCU) are 14.6 percentage points more likely to earn a bachelor's degree and, around age 30, have 5 percent higher household income and $12,000 more in student loan balances than those who do not enroll in an HBCU. We find that results are largely driven by an increased likelihood of completing a degree from relatively broad-access HBCUs in lieu of a two-year college or no college.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230289
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Routine-Biased Technological Change and Endogenous Skill Investments,"Danyelle Branco, Bladimir Carrillo and Wilman Iglesias","We investigate how individuals alter their educational investments in response to routine-biased technology. We find that individuals growing up in robot-impacted areas are more likely to complete a bachelor's degree and experience a relative increase in earnings. Changes in the skill premium and opportunity cost appear to drive these effects. To interpret these findings, we estimate a model of endogenous skill acquisition where changes in the demand and supply of skills shape the path of earnings. Counterfactual simulations suggest that the endogenous skill response cannot fully undo the adverse earnings effects of automation unless there are sufficiently generous educational subsidies.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220407

W.  de Grazia and Mike H. M. Teodorescu","Analyzing a randomized control trial at the United States Patent and Trademark Office that was designed to provide additional help to applicants who do not have legal representation, we find heterogeneous causal impacts across inventor gender, driven primarily by an increase in successful negotiations by women inventor teams via the use of examiner's amendments. While both men and women applicants benefited, the probability of obtaining a patent was over 12 percentage points greater for women. Our results suggest that a portion of the gender gap in patenting could be eliminated through additional assistance during patent examination.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230253
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,International Transmission of Inequality through Trade,Sergey Nigai,"I examine the international transmission of income inequality through trade. Using firm-level and aggregate data, I find that exporting to more unequal countries increases domestic inequality. I rationalize this finding by developing a model of international consumer targeting in which firms serve specific consumer segments in each market. Inequality in export markets shapes the distribution of firms' profits and, therefore, the incomes of individuals linked to them, widening domestic inequality. The calibrated model suggests that international inequality transmission explains 4.4 percent and 4.8 percent of the observed levels of Gini coefficients and income shares of the top 1 percent, respectively.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230497
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,"Does the ""Boost for Mathematics"" Boost Mathematics? A Large-Scale Evaluation of the ""Lesson Study"" Methodology on Student Performance","Erik Grönqvist, Björn Öckert and Olof Rosenqvist","Students in East Asian countries dominate international assessments. One possible explanation for their success is the use of ""Lesson study"" to enhance teaching practices; a collaborative process where teachers plan, observe, and analyze a lesson together. We evaluate a national teacher development program in Sweden—""Boost for Mathematics""—containing core elements of Lesson study. Exploiting the gradual rollout of the program across compulsory schools, we find that it improves teaching practices and boosts students' mathematics performance. The positive effect on student performance persists also long after the intervention has ended. The program also passes a cost-benefit test.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220009
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,"Should College Be ""Free""? Evidence on Free College, Early Commitment, and Merit Aid from an Eight-Year Randomized Trial",Douglas N. Harris and Jonathan Mills,"We provide evidence on the effects of college financial aid from an eight-year randomized trial offering ninth graders a $12,000 merit-based grant. The program was designed to be free of tuition/fees at community colleges and substantially lower the cost of four-year colleges. During high school, eligibility for the grant increased students' expectations of college attendance and low-cost college preparation effort, but not higher-cost effort. The program may have increased graduation from two-year colleges but did not affect overall college entry, graduation, employment, incarceration, or teen pregnancy. Additional analysis helps explain these modest effects and variation in results across prior studies.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230100
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Terrorism and Voting: The Rise of Right-Wing Populism in Germany,"Navid Sabet, Marius Liebald and Guido Friebel","We document that right-wing terrorism leads to significant increases in vote share for the right-wing, populist AfD (Alternative fur Deutschland) party in Germany. To identify causal effects, we exploit quasi-random variation between successful and failed attacks across municipalities. Using the SOEP, a longitudinal panel of individuals, we find successful terror leads individuals to prefer the AfD and worry about migration. Political parties—the AfD in particular—adjust their messaging in election manifestos in response to terror. Overall, and in contrast to previous work, we find terrorism is consequential to the rise of right-wing populism in a Western, multiparty democratic system.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230615
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Pandering in the Shadows: How Natural Disasters Affect Special Interest Politics,"Ethan Kaplan, Jörg Spenkuch and Haishan Yuan","We exploit the quasi-random timing of natural disasters to study the connection between public attention to politics and legislators' support for special interests. We show that when a disaster strikes, the news media reduce coverage of politics in general and of individual legislators in particular, and members of the House of Representatives become significantly more likely to adopt special interest donors' positions. The evidence implies that politicians are more inclined to take actions benefiting special interests when the public is distracted. More broadly, our findings suggest that attention to politics improves electoral accountability even in an environment with stringent transparency requirements.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230783
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Healthy at Work? Evidence from a Social Experimental Evaluation of a Firm-Based Wellness Program,Marianne Simonsen and Lars Skipper,"We employ a large social experiment combined with register-based data, allowing for up to 12-year follow-up to evaluate a long-lasting employer-sponsored health and well-being program. We show that employees at treated worksites receive fewer consultations from their primary care physician and purchase fewer prescription drugs. These effects persist up to seven years after randomization, though with some fade-out. We find no effects on overall hospitalizations in either the short or longer run, and the program was not successful in improving labor-related outcomes such as absence and turnover. Finally, we show some evidence of spillovers within the family.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210024

We draw on an RCT implemented in 200 middle schools in three countries. The program leads students to conduct citizenship projects in their communities under the supervision of teachers trained in the intervention. The intervention caused a decline in absenteeism and disciplinary sanctions at school, alongside improved academic achievement. It also led students to diversify their friendship network. The program has stronger effects when implemented by teachers who are initially more involved in the life of the school.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230612
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Dividend Taxation and Firm Performance with Heterogeneous Payout Responses,"Katarzyna Bilicka, İrem Güçeri and Evangelos Koumanakos","We analyze the performance of firms that were differentially affected by an unexpected tax on dividends before the global financial crisis. We use exogenous policy variation for firms with different legal statuses and financial year-end dates to separately identify the policy announcement and implementation effects. We provide causal evidence for a sharp drop in dividends but zero change in equipment purchases. Treated firms accumulate investment goods that are likely to be owner-manager's personal assets instead of productive capital. At a time of severe liquidity shortage, some of the funds kept in the firm are used to pay back short-term debt.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230109
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Buy Baits and Consumer Sophistication: Field Evidence from Instant Rebates,Matthias Rodemeier,"Are consumers in the marketplace aware of their cognitive limitations? I answer this question in the context of a ubiquitous form of price discrimination: instant rebates that require active redemption. In a large-scale field experiment with a major online retailer, I find that consumers correctly increase demand when the firm offers a redemption reminder, but they fail to reduce demand when the firm increases the hassle required to redeem. Structural estimates reveal that, while consumers are sophisticated about the probability of forgetting to redeem the rebate, they vastly underestimate the hassle of redeeming it by €20 per consumer.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230358

Recently—inspired by research based on hypothetical choices—jurisdictions have tried to increase organ donor registrations by changing how the registration question is asked. We evaluate these changes with a novel ""field-in-the-lab"" experiment, in which subjects change their real organ donor status, and with new donor registration data collected from US states. A ""yes/no"" frame is not more effective than an ""opt-in"" frame, contradicting conclusions based on hypothetical choices, but other question wording can matter, and asking individuals to reconsider their donor status increases registrations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220760
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Public and Private Provision of Information in Market-Based Public Programs: Evidence from Advertising in Health Insurance Marketplaces,Naoki Aizawa and You Suk Kim,"This paper studies government and private advertising in market-based public programs. In a model of advertising, we first examine when government advertising increases welfare. Then, we estimate the effects of advertising on consumer demand and assess their welfare effects in the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces. We find government advertising increases overall enrollment and enhances welfare. By contrast, the market expansion effect of private advertising is modest at most. Although private advertising increases demand for insurers in certain specifications, it is not a very efficient tool to induce consumers to select insurers with better plans due to rent-seeking competition.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220352

""Schmeduling"" in Two-Part Tariffs in Energy",Koichiro Ito and Shuang Zhang,"A central assumption in economics is that consumers properly distinguish fixed cost from variable cost. This assumption is fundamental to various economic theories, including optimal taxation, redistribution, and price discrimination. Using a quasi-experiment in heating price reform in China, we find empirical evidence that is inconsistent with this conventional assumption and more consistent with the ""schmeduling"" model in Liebman and Zeckhauser (2004). As we demonstrate its policy implications for two-part energy tariffs, this schmeduling behavior makes fixed costs directly relevant to the perceived relative prices of goods, and therefore alters the welfare implications of price, tax, and subsidy designs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230613
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Free Trade and the Formation of Environmental Policy: Evidence from US Legislative Votes,Jevan Cherniwchan and Nouri Najjar,We test the hypothesis that governments alter environmental policy in response to trade by studying NAFTA's effects on the formation of environmental policy in the US House of Representatives between 1990 and 2000. We find that reductions in US tariffs decreased political support for environmental legislation. This decrease appears to be due to (i) a reduction in support by incumbent Republican legislators in response to trade-induced changes in the policy preferences of their constituents and (ii) changes in partisan representation in affected districts due to decreased electoral support for pro-NAFTA Democrats following the agreement.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230733

EV owners respond strongly to financial incentives, reducing charging during peak hours by 49 percent by shifting to off-peak hours. In contrast, a prosocial information treatment has no discernible effect. When financial incentives are removed, charge timing reverts to pre-intervention behavior, reinforcing that ""money matters.""

Local News and Police Behavior in the United States,Nicola Mastrorocco and Arianna Ornaghi,"Do US municipal police departments respond to news coverage of local crime? We address this question exploiting an exogenous shock to local crime reporting induced by acquisitions of local TV stations by a large broadcast group, Sinclair. Using a unique dataset of 8.5 million news stories and a triple-differences design, we document that Sinclair ownership decreases news coverage of local crime. This matters for policing: Municipalities that experience the change in news coverage have lower violent crime clearance rates relative to municipalities that do not.

We find that the program has a positive impact on national key poor counties, with a 10.9 percent increase in rural income. This effect mainly arises via industrial support, agricultural development, and public service improvement. Poverty alleviation strategies consistent with local comparative advantages yield more significant effects. Household-level analyses suggest the program changes households' income and expenditure, and the effects are particularly substantial for the poorest households.

We infer the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) to be between 0.33 and 2.28 across value-added tax (VAT) and turnover categories, and quantify the marginal efficiency burden (MEB) of the corporation tax. Given limited extensive-margin responses, our evidence suggests the MT reduced the overall efficiency burden while raising additional tax revenue.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230108
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Informing Mothers about the Benefits of Conversing with Infants: Experimental Evidence from Ghana,"Pascaline Dupas, Camille Falezan, Seema Jayachandran and Mark Walsh","We evaluate a low-cost intervention designed to boost parents' verbal engagement with infants, which tends to be limited in developing countries. In our randomized experiment, recent or expectant mothers watched a three-minute informational video and received a themed calendar. Six months later, treated mothers reported stronger belief in the benefits of verbal engagement, more frequent parent-infant conversation, and more advanced infant language skills. Treatment effects on objective measures of parent-child conversation frequency and infant skills were positive but insignificant. We find larger immediate treatment effects on objective parent-child conversation, suggesting potentially larger long-term effects had the behavior change stuck more.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230283
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Pay Transparency and Gender Equality,"Jack Blundell, Emma Duchini, Ştefania Simion and Arthur Turrell","Since 2018, UK firms with at least 250 employees have been mandated to publicly disclose gender equality indicators. Exploiting variations in this mandate across firm size and time, we show that pay transparency closes 19 percent of the gender pay gap by reducing men's pay growth. By combining different sources of data, we also provide suggestive evidence that the public availability of the equality indicators enhances public scrutiny. In turn, employers more exposed to public scrutiny seem to reduce their gender pay gap the most.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220766
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Communicating Program Eligibility: A Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Field Experiment,"Jeffrey Hemmeter, John Phillips, Elana Safran and Nicholas Wilson","We conducted a direct mail field experiment with 4,016,461 individuals to test several key hypotheses about why take-up of Supplemental Security Income among individuals age 65 and above is so low. Communicating likely eligibility in a basic letter generated substantial increases in take-up in relative terms. Adding behaviorally informed statements increased the effectiveness of these communications. Yet, the application rate in our study sample during the full 24-month follow-up period remained no greater than 7 percent. Our results reveal a modest trade-off between increasing applications and the conditional likelihood of award, as well as the award amount.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20210560
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Physician Group Influences on Treatment Intensity and Health: Evidence from Physician Switchers,Joseph J. Doyle and Becky Staiger,"Treatment intensity varies remarkably across physicians, and physicians are increasingly working in groups. This paper tests whether group affiliation impacts physicians' treatment intensity and patient health. Using Medicare inpatient claims data, we focus on internists who switch groups within the same hospital. Event studies show that internists who join more-intensive groups immediately increase their own intensity, with an elasticity of 0.27. This change is reflected in higher Medicare spending due to higher-priced services. We do not detect a change in health outcomes, suggesting that treatment intensity induced by group affiliation may not be productive.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220555
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,"Clean Identification? The Effects of the Clean Air Act on Air Pollution, Exposure Disparities, and House Prices",Lutz Sager and Gregor Singer,"We assess the US Clean Air Act standards for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Using high-resolution data, we find that the 2005 regulation reduced PM2.5 levels by 0.4 μg/ m3 over five years, with larger effects in more polluted areas. Standard difference-in-differences overstates these effects by a factor of three because time trends differ by baseline pollution, a bias we overcome with three alternative approaches. We show that the regulation contributed to narrowing Urban-Rural and Black-White PM2.5 exposure disparities, but less than difference-in-differences suggest. Pollution damages capitalized into house prices, however, appear larger than previously thought when leveraging regulatory variation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220745
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Uncharted Waters: Effects of Maritime Emission Regulation,Jamie Hansen-Lewis and Michelle Marcus,"Maritime shipping emits as much fine particulate matter as half of global road traffic. We are the first to measure the consequences of US maritime emissions standards on air quality, human health, racial exposure disparities, and behavior. The introduction of US maritime emissions control areas significantly decreased fine particulate matter, low birth weight, and infant mortality. Yet, only about half of the forecasted fine particulate matter abatement was achieved by the policy. We show evidence consistent with behavioral responses among ship operators, other polluters, and individuals that muted the policy's impact, but were not incorporated in ex ante models.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220626
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Mental Health Consequences of Correctional Sentencing,"Manudeep Bhuller, Laura Khoury and Katrine Løken",Understanding whether and in what situations correctional sentencing improves or exacerbates defendants' mental health conditions is important for the design of criminal justice policies. We combine detailed Norwegian data on visits to health care professionals with quasi-experimental designs to measure the impacts of correctional sentences on mental health-related visits. Our causal evidence shows that rehabilitation-oriented sentencing can improve defendants' mental health conditions. We find that these effects are persistent and unlikely driven by shifts in health care demand. We interpret these findings in light of the rehabilitative focus of the Norwegian correctional system.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220227
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,The Impact of Provider Payments on Health Care Utilization of Low-Income Individuals: Evidence from Medicare and Medicaid,"Marika Cabral, Colleen Carey and Sarah Miller","Provider payments are the key determinant of insurance generosity within many health insurance programs covering low-income populations. This paper analyzes a large, federally mandated provider payment increase for primary care services provided to low-income elderly and disabled individuals. Using comprehensive administrative data, we leverage variation across beneficiaries and providers in the policy-induced payment increase in difference-in-differences and triple differences research designs. We find the payment increase led to a 6 percent increase in the targeted services for eligible beneficiaries, implying a payment elasticity of 1.2, and decreased the fraction of low-income beneficiaries with no primary care visit in a year by 9 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220775

We show that a 1 percentage point decrease in subsidy rate leads to a 1 percent decrease in manufacturing employment. We document important local spillovers for the untreated construction and retail sectors, counties connected via trade, and local tax rates. There is no evidence for regional reallocation, within-firm spillover, or changes in commuting and residential decisions. The cost per job amounts to about $19,000. We show local subsidies are substantially more effective in curbing regional inequality than place-blind policies.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220667

Many of these medical procedures are alleged to have been performed without patient consent. The subsequent disclosure of alleged illegal sterilizations caused reductions in the usage of contraceptive methods and prenatal and birth delivery services and, more generally, the demand for medical services in affected areas. As a result, child health worsened. The results persist for at least 17 years after the information disclosure and are driven by disappointed supporters of the implementing government. Learning about the government's malpractices undermined trust in institutions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20230155
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,The Great Recession and the Widening Income Gap between Alumni of Elite and Less Selective Universities,Russell Weinstein,"Using mobility report card data, I show the income gap between alumni of elite and less selective universities widened for cohorts graduating during the Great Recession. This is evident for mean and median incomes and access to high earning percentiles. Results do not appear driven by differences in student composition, including parental income. Using a unique dataset of recruiting strategies for prestigious firms, I highlight one channel through which university selectivity may have a causal impact: high-wage firms concentrated their recruiting at elite universities during the recession. The results are informative for policies increasing lower-income students' representation at selective universities.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220174

We study the effect of financial incentives on the adoption of electronic payment technology and on tax compliance by firms. Exploiting administrative data and policy variation from Uruguay, we show that (i) consumer VAT rebates for credit and debit transactions trigger an immediate 50 percent increase in the number of card transactions, (ii) firms' use of card machines increases only on the intensive margin, and (iii) tax compliance is unaffected. Endogenous card machine adoption and a low share of card sales in total reported sales can rationalize the findings.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220434
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,My Taxes Are Too Darn High: Why Do Households Protest Their Taxes?,"Brad Nathan, Ricardo Perez-Truglia and Alejandro Zentner","In the United States and globally, taxpayers can file a protest to legally reduce their property taxes. While tax protests can provide a unique opportunity to study the (un)willingness to pay taxes, they have received little attention from researchers. Using a field experiment and a quasi-experiment, we study what motivates households to protest their property taxes. We find that both expected savings and filing frictions play significant roles. We estimate the magnitude of filing frictions using a money metric. We also discuss how low-cost interventions targeted at disadvantaged groups can mitigate existing disparities in the system of tax appeals.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220768

Evans, Shawna Kolka, James Sullivan and Patrick Turner","Families in poverty face numerous barriers to establishing stable economic footing. This paper estimates experimental effects of a holistic, individualized wraparound service intervention for low-income individuals. The intervention includes a detailed assessment, an individualized service plan, intensive case management administered by a two-person team with small caseloads, and strategic financial assistance. The program improved employment and housing outcomes two years postenrollment. Given the customized nature of the services, overall program effects mask heterogeneity. Exploratory analysis suggests that the program helped employ participants who lacked employment but had stable housing and that those without stable housing were helped in securing it.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200716
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,Fueling Alternatives: Gas Station Choice and the Implications for Electric Charging,"Jackson Dorsey, Ashley Langer and Shaun McRae","This paper quantifies the value of electric vehicle (EV) charging networks and the marginal value of network speed and density. We estimate a model of gasoline drivers' refueling preferences and simulate how these potential future EV drivers value refueling time under counterfactual charging networks. Drivers value refueling time at $19.73/hour. EV adopters with home charging receive $675 per vehicle in benefits from avoiding travel to gas stations, whereas refueling travel and waiting time costs $7,763 for drivers using public charging. Increasing network charging speed yields three times greater time savings than a proportional increase in station density.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220130
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,The Long-Run Effects of California's Paid Family Leave Act on Women's Careers and Childbearing: New Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design and US Tax Data,"Martha Bailey, Tanya Byker, Elena Patel and Shanthi Ramnath","We use administrative tax data to analyze the cumulative, long-run effects of California's 2004 Paid Family Leave Act (CPFL) on women's employment, earnings, and childbearing. A regression-discontinuity design exploits the sharp increase in the weeks of paid leave available under the law. We find no evidence that CPFL increased employment, boosted earnings, or encouraged childbearing, suggesting that CPFL had little effect on the gender pay gap or child penalty. For first-time mothers, we find that CPFL reduced employment and earnings a decade after they gave birth.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20200277

Relying on detailed panel data of R&D-active firms in Germany over two decades, we exploit identifying variation induced by more than 10,000 municipal changes in the local business tax rate and federal tax reforms with locally varying effects. Using event-study techniques, we find a sizable, negative effect of profit taxes on establishments' total R&D spending and patents filed. Zooming into the innovation production process, we uncover substantial heterogeneity in the impact of profit taxation for various R&D input factors, among firm characteristics, and for different types of research projects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220580

They turn out to be strikingly progressive. We calibrate a municipality-level structural model with quasi-experimental estimates of taxpayer mobility by family type. Households with children are found to be less mobile than households without children and to have stronger preferences for locally provided public goods. Combined with capitalization of taxes into housing prices and nonhomothetic housing demand, this implies that the incidence of local income taxes mainly falls on high-income childless households. Increases in local income taxes, even if flat rate, turn out to be more progressive than property taxes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220462
AEJ: Economic Policy,2025,The Negative Consequences of Loss-Framed Performance Incentives,"Lamar Pierce, Alex Rees-Jones and Charlotte Blank","Behavioral economists have proposed that incentive contracts result in higher productivity when bonuses are ""loss framed""—prepaid then clawed back if targets are unmet. We test this claim by randomizing the pre- or postpayment of sales bonuses at 294 car dealerships. Although somewhat statistically imprecise, our analysis provides strong indications that the random assignment of loss framing had quantitatively important negative effects. We document that the negative effects of loss framing can arise due to an increase in incentives for ""gaming"" behaviors. Based on these claims, we reassess the common wisdom regarding the desirability of loss framing.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20220512

We exploit differential timing across countries and vaccines to estimate the effects of this public health initiative. We find that Gavi's support for a vaccine increased coverage rates by 2–5 percentage points across all vaccines and by 10–20 percentage points for newer vaccines. We also find that Gavi's support reduced child mortality from related causes by 1 child per 1,000 live births.
