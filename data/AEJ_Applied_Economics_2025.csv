AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Labor Supply and Entertainment Innovations: Evidence from the US TV Rollout,George Fenton and Felix Koenig,"We study the impact of entertainment technology on labor supply. Using Social Security work histories and a natural experiment arising from the regulated US rollout of television, we estimate that a station launch reduced the probability of working by around 0.3 percentage points, driven mainly by an increase in older-age-group retirement rates. The results support the hypothesis that television's rise contributed to the midcentury transition of retirement from a necessity to ""golden years"" of enjoyment. Our findings indicate that entertainment innovations have a less pronounced effect on overall labor supply trends than model calibrations in the previous literature suggest.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230377
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Home Sweet Home: Returns to Returning in the Age of Mass Migration,"Olof Ejermo, Kerstin Enflo, Björn Eriksson and Erik Prawitz","Despite significant circular migration flows historically and today, their economic impacts remain understudied. Using data on predominantly rural Swedish migrants who returned from the United States during the Age of Mass Migration, we estimate returns to temporary migration in terms of wealth, income, demographic, and social outcomes. We find substantial wealth effects but limited evidence of increased labor income or occupational upgrading. Male returnees held nearly double the wealth of stayers, likely due to overseas savings, while female returnees gained wealth mainly through marriage. These findings highlight the need to consider wealth when evaluating the economic returns of temporary migration.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230253
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Down to the Wire: Leveraging Technology to Improve Electric Utility Cost Recovery,"Husnain F. Ahmad, Ayesha Ali, Robyn C. Meeks, Zhenxuan Wang and Javed Younas","We study the effects of a technical intervention in Karachi, Pakistan—converting bare distribution wires to aerial bundled cables (ABCs)—that was intended to prevent illegal grid connections and improve utility cost recovery. Theft-resistant cables reduced losses. This occurred primarily through decreases in unbilled consumption, with the number of formal utility customers and their billed consumption both increasing. Load-shedding outages decreased. In areas with these cables installed, consumers have more appliances and higher electricity-related expenditures. Revenue recovery rose, but consumers' billing-related complaints also increased.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230468
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Labor Market Inequality and the Changing Life Cycle Profile of Male and Female Wages,"Richard Blundell, Hugo Lopez and James P. Ziliak","We estimate the full distribution of life cycle wages for cohorts of men and women in the United States using a quantile selection model to account for systematic differences in employment by gender and education group. Although common within-group time effects are shown to be a key driver of labor market inequalities across gender, important additional differences by birth cohort emerge with more recent cohorts of women delaying child rearing and, by implication, the onset of child penalties in wages. These cross-cohort differences help account for the stalling of progress in gender wage gaps over the past quarter century.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220454
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,"The Franchise, Policing, and Race: Evidence from Arrests Data and the Voting Rights Act","Giovanni Facchini, Brian Knight and Cecilia Testa","This paper investigates the relationship between the franchise and policing. We find that, following the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Black arrest rates in counties that both had more newly enfranchised Blacks and were covered by the legislation fell, compared to similar Southern counties that were not covered. We document no corresponding patterns for White arrests. Our results are driven by arrests by sheriffs, who are always elected, and by less serious offenses. These results indicate that voting rights, when combined with electoral accountability, lead to improved treatment of minority groups by police.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230640
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,"Taxes Today, Benefits Tomorrow",Thomas Le Barbanchon,"This paper tests whether partially unemployed workers value future preserved benefits when they bunch at the kink of the unemployment insurance benefit-withdrawal schedule. I extend the bunching formula of Saez (2010) to a dynamic setting that accounts for the value of future benefits tied to taxation. This yields new tests of tax-benefit linkage based on bunching heterogeneity. I verify in quasi-experiments that UI extension programs that decrease the value of future preserved benefits lead to more bunching and to lower labor supply. Last, a quantification exercise of the dynamic bunching formula provides extra support for a strong tax-benefit linkage.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210550
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Pulled In and Crowded Out: Heterogeneous Outcomes of Merit-Based School Choice,"Antonio Dalla-Zuanna, Kai Liu and Kjell G. Salvanes","We analyze the effects of reforming the high school admission system from a residence based allocation to a merit-based allocation. The merit-based system generates oversubscribed schools, which favor high-GPA students at the expense of displacing low-GPA ones. We use the potential outcomes framework to analyze the effects of the reform, separating the effects for those gaining access to competitive schools from those losing access and identifying these parameters by using the reform as an instrument within subpopulations defined by admission cutoffs and GPA. The small and negative overall effect of the reform hides large negative effects for the crowded-out students.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220104
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Where Do My Tax Dollars Go? Tax Morale Effects of Perceived Government Spending,"Matias Giaccobasso, Brad Nathan, Ricardo Perez-Truglia and Alejandro Zentner","Do perceptions about government spending affect willingness to pay taxes? We test this hypothesis with a natural field experiment that focuses on the allocation of property taxes to public schools. Our results show that taxpayers often misperceive the destination of their tax dollars. By introducing shocks to households' perceptions via an information-provision experiment, we find that perceptions of how tax dollars are used significantly affect the probability of filing a tax appeal. Moreover, the effects are consistent with reciprocal motivations: individuals are more willing to pay taxes if they believe that the government services funded by those taxes will provide greater personal benefit.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20240029
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,The Impact of Trade Liberalization in the Presence of Political Distortions,Sebastian Jävervall and Roza Khoban,"Political distortions are prevalent in many developing countries, implying substantial productivity losses. This paper investigates the impact of trade liberalization on political distortions in India. First, using variation in political turnover, we identify that politicians distort resources in favor of politically connected firms. Second, we show that reduced tariffs on input goods significantly decrease the distortionary effect of political connections, as trade reduces firms' dependence on politicians for sourcing inputs. The results suggest a new margin for gains from trade through reduced politically driven misallocation, implying that trade can address a widespread source of productivity losses.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230629
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Tax Incentives for Migrants with Mid-level Earnings: Evidence from the Netherlands,"Lisa Timm, Massimo Giuliodori and Paul Muller","We examine how income taxes affect international mobility and wages. We study a Dutch preferential tax scheme for migrants, which introduced an income threshold for eligibility in 2012. The threshold is low relative to similar schemes in other countries, thereby offering eligibility to migrants with mid-level earnings. We find migration more than doubles closely above the income threshold, while migration below the threshold remains unchanged. These effects appear to be driven by additional migration, while wage bargaining responses are limited. We estimate a migration elasticity ranging from 1.6 to 2.7, somewhat higher than most studies on high-income migrants have found.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230438
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Can Development Programs Counter Insurgencies? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Afghanistan,"Andrew Beath, Fotini Christia and Ruben Enikolopov","We exploit a randomized controlled trial conducted between 2007 and 2011 to identify the effect of Afghanistan's largest local governance and development program on the strength of the insurgency. We find that the program reduced violence, improved economic outcomes, and increased government support in interior regions of the country, but increased violence in villages close to the Pakistani border, where foreign insurgents were more numerous. The results suggest that development programs can be effective in suppressing locally driven insurgencies, but may be counterproductive where insurgents are not reliant on the local population for support.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230150
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Not Playing Favorites: Parents and the Value of Equal Opportunity,"James Berry, Rebecca Dizon-Ross and Maulik Jagnani","We conduct two experiments to identify the value parents place on equality of opportunity when investing in children. The experiments exogenously vary short-run returns to educational investments to identify the weight placed on equalizing ""opportunity"" (child-level investment) relative to maximizing ""returns"" (total household earnings) or to equalizing ""outcomes"" (child-level expected earnings). While parents in both experiments place some weight on maximizing returns, they also display a strong preference for equalizing opportunities and are willing to forgo 15–45 percent of their earnings to do so. Parents in higher-income countries also care about equalizing outcomes, while parents in lower-income countries do not.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220601
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Food Transfers and Child Nutrition: Evidence from India's Public Distribution System,"Aditya Shrinivas, Kathy Baylis and Benjamin Crost","India's National Food Security Act of 2013 (NFSA) led to one of the biggest expansions in food transfers in history, affecting over 500 million people. We use plausibly exogenous variation created by the NFSA to estimate the effect of food transfers on child nutrition. Using individual panel data across eight states in India over five years, we find that increased transfers significantly reduced stunting. The food transfers increased wage incomes and improved dietary diversity. Our results suggest that, in the states we study, the NFSA prevented approximately 1.8 million children from being stunted.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220505
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Skill Depreciation during Unemployment: Evidence from Panel Data,"Jonathan Cohen, Andrew C. Johnston and Attila Lindner","We examine the depreciation of skills among unemployed German workers using a panel of skill measures linked to administrative data. Both the reemployment hazard and reemployment earnings steadily decline with unemployment duration. Indicators of depression and loneliness also rise substantially. However, we find no decline in a wide range of cognitive and noncognitive skills while workers remain unemployed. We find the same pattern in a panel of American workers. The results imply that skill depreciation in general human capital is unlikely to be a major explanation for observed duration dependence in reemployment outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230195
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,New Gig Work or Changes in Reporting? Understanding Self-Employment Trends in Tax Data,"Andrew Garin, Emilie Jackson and Dmitri Koustas","We show that increases in the share of workers reporting self-employment to the IRS are not associated with changes in firm-reported payments to ""gig"" and other contract workers after 2005 but are driven primarily by self-reported earnings of individuals in the EITC phase-in range. We examine a regression discontinuity design that generates exogenous variation in tax rates at the end of the year after labor supply decisions are already sunk and find tax code incentives increase self-employment reporting conditional on actual labor supply. We show that reporting effects have grown over time as knowledge of the tax code spreads.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220483
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Voice at Work,"Jarkko Harju, Simon Jäger and Benjamin Schoefer","We estimate the effects of worker voice on productivity, job quality, and separations. We study the 1991 introduction of a right to worker representation on boards or advisory councils in Finnish firms with at least 150 employees, designed to facilitate workforce-management communication. Consistent with information-sharing theories, our difference-in-differences design reveals that worker voice raised labor productivity. In contrast to exit-voice theory, we find no effects on voluntary job separations. However, treated firms reduce involuntary separations (during our recessionary sample period). A 2008 introduction of shop-floor representation, another worker voice institution preexisting in our main firm sample, had more limited effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220451
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,"Preferences, Selection, and the Structure of Teacher Pay",Andrew C. Johnston,"I examine teacher preferences using a discrete-choice experiment linked to data on teacher effectiveness. I estimate willingness to pay for a rich set of compensation elements and working conditions. Highly effective teachers usually have the same preferences as their peers, but they have stronger preferences for performance pay. I use the preference estimates to investigate the optimal compensation structure for three key objectives: maximizing teacher utility, maximizing teacher retention, and maximizing student achievement. Under each objective, schools underutilize salary and performance pay while overutilizing retirement benefits. Restructuring compensation can significantly improve both teacher welfare and student achievement.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210763
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,"Background Matters, but Not Whether Parents Are Immigrants: Outcomes of Children Born in Denmark",Mathias Fjællegaard Jensen and Alan Manning,"In Europe, the children of migrants often have worse economic outcomes than those with local-born parents. This paper shows that children born in Denmark with immigrant parents (first-generation locals) have lower earnings, higher unemployment, less education, more welfare transfers, and more criminal convictions than children with local-born parents. However, when we condition on parental socioeconomic characteristics, first-generation locals generally perform as well or slightly better than the children of locals. While children of immigrants are more likely to come from deprived backgrounds, they do not experience substantially different outcomes conditional on parental background.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230389

Gee","We study how salary disclosures affect employer demand using a field experiment featuring hundreds of recruiters evaluating over 2,000 job applications. We randomize the presence of salary questions and the candidates' disclosures for male and female applicants. Our findings suggest that extra dollars disclosed yield higher salary offers, willingness to pay, and perceptions of outside options by recruiters (all similarly for men and women). Recruiters make negative inferences about the quality and bargaining positions of nondisclosing candidates, though they penalize silent women less.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230365

Can better management information systems improve delivery speed? Does improving the delivery speed reduce corruption? In a large-scale experiment with the Bangladesh Civil Service, I send monthly scorecards measuring delays in service delivery to government officials and their supervisors. The scorecards increase on-time service delivery by 11 percent but do not reduce bribes. Instead, the scorecards increase bribes for high-performing bureaucrats. A model where bureaucrats' reputational concerns constrain bribes can explain the results. When positive performance feedback improves bureaucrats' reputations, the constraint is relaxed, and bribes increase.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230672
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,The High and Falling Price of Cement in Africa,"Fabrizio Leone, Rocco Macchiavello and Tristan Reed","Prices for several intermediate inputs, including cement, are higher in developing economies—particularly in Africa. Combining recent data from the International Comparison Program with a global directory of cement firms, we estimate an industry equilibrium model to distinguish between drivers of international price dispersion: demand, costs, conduct, and entry. Developing economies feature both higher marginal costs and higher markups. African markets are not characterized by less competitive conduct and, if anything, feature lower barriers to entry. Yet the small size of many national markets limits entry and competition and explains most of the higher markups and prices. Policy implications are discussed.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230352
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Wind of Change? Cultural Determinants of Maternal Labor Supply,"Barbara Boelmann, Anna Raute and Uta Schönberg","We investigate the role of cultural norms in shaping women's labor supply decisions after childbirth. Specifically, we are interested in the interplay between childhood socialization and adulthood environment. To that end, we leverage the setting of the German reunification when East Germany's gender-egalitarian culture induced by socialism and West Germany's more traditional culture were brought together. We find that East German gender norms are persistent, whereas West German ones are not. West German mothers adjust their behavior to that of their East German peers not only when immersed in East German environment but even after returning to the West.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220567

The childcare subsidy substantially increased the labor supply and earnings of single mothers, highlighting the importance of time constraints for them. Among couples, childcare did not affect mothers' labor market outcomes but instead increased fathers' salaried employment. At the household level, childcare led to higher income and consumption and improved child development. Cash grants positively affected mothers' labor supply and income irrespective of the household structure, suggesting the general importance of credit constraints for women's business development.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230227

Using data collected in two regions of Bangladesh four years after a randomized intervention ended, we find that combining cash transfers with complementary programming led to sustained increases in consumption and reductions in poverty. Combining food transfers with complementary programming showed similar patterns to a lesser extent. Cash alone had context-specific sustained effects; food alone had no sustained impacts. Results suggest that context, modality, and complementary programming matter for sustained impacts.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230108
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Do Peers Matter in the Police Academy?,Roman Rivera,"Increasing underrepresented groups' representation in police departments is a common proposal to reduce aggressive policing. This paper documents the effects of peer composition in the Chicago police academy on officers' future arrests by exploiting the lottery system, which provides exogenous variation in cohort composition. I find that higher shares of peers from groups that police less aggressively, such as female and older officers, reduce all officers' future low-level arrests. Peer race matters by amplifying the effects of gender and age. Overall, the results are most consistent with peers' preferences for less aggressive policing shifting officers' preferences and changing future behavior.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220348

I use administrative records to examine the effects of the interventions on college enrollment, graduation, and income up to age 29. The guidance intervention increased students' four-year college enrollment and graduation rates and had positive effects on individuals' income in adulthood.

AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,The Productivity Consequences of Pollution-Induced Migration in China,"Gaurav Khanna, Wenquan Liang, Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak and Ran Song","We quantify how pollution affects aggregate productivity and welfare in spatial equilibrium. We show that skilled workers in China emigrate away from polluted cities. These patterns are evident under various empirical specifications, such as when instrumenting for pollution using upwind power plants, or thermal inversions. Pollution changes the spatial distribution of skilled and unskilled workers, and wage returns by location. We quantify the loss in aggregate productivity due to this re-sorting by estimating a spatial equilibrium model. Counterfactual simulations show that reducing pollution increases productivity through spatial re-sorting by approximately as much as the direct health benefits of clean air.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220655

This paper provides a counterpoint by documenting that reliance on hereditary information can amplify the misallocation of low-value care. We study Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and show that reliance on family medical history generates a ""snowball effect""—the propagation of an original marginal diagnosis to a patient's relatives. This snowball effect raises the private and social costs of low-value care.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230303

Using newly constructed data on the locations and characteristics of over 1,000 wind farms in India, we estimate that at least 52 percent of approved carbon offsets were allocated to projects that would very likely have been built anyway.

AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,The Simpler the Better? Threshold Effects of Energy Labels on Property Prices and Energy Efficiency Investments,"Rodolfo Sejas-Portillo, Mirko Moro and Till Stowasser","Using British data on over 7 million residential property sales, we find that the simplified energy efficiency (EE) information leads to important market effects. UK legislation requires the use of an energy label that shows an EE rating score (1–100) mapped into arbitrary color-coded rating bands (A–G). Applying a regression discontinuity design, we document significant price discontinuities at rating band thresholds, indicating heuristic thinking in the market. These price discontinuities influence market behavior as sellers are more likely to make EE investments if their property is just below a threshold.

AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,"Smart Thermostats, Automation, and Time-Varying Prices","Joshua Blonz, Karen Palmer, Casey Wichman and Derek C. Wietelman","Can automation complement economic incentives? We explore this question by randomly encouraging households to activate a feature on their existing smart thermostat that automates responsiveness to time-of-use electricity pricing. The feature reduces air conditioning use during the highest-priced afternoon period, raising indoor temperatures above a household's preferred temperature, primarily for customers who are typically home during the day. Customers infrequently override the feature when they experience discomfort, suggesting that they are willing to trade off monetary savings for small increases in discomfort. Automation thus enables low-cost changes in household energy use, with potentially large electricity supply-cost reductions at scale.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210618

Impacts due simply to discomfort are less well understood. This paper investigates individuals' valuations of weather using a revealed preference approach. We first quantify the decline in attendance at Major League Baseball games on hot and cold days. Leveraging this finding coupled with the historically informed assumption of a horizontal supply curve, we infer a monetized estimate of the disutility of extreme temperatures.

AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Better Alone? Evidence on the Costs of Intermunicipal Cooperation,Clemence Tricaud,"This paper provides new evidence on why municipalities are often reluctant to integrate. Exploiting a French reform that made intermunicipal cooperation mandatory, I find that municipalities forced to integrate experienced a large increase in construction, consistent with NIMBYism, explaining their resistance and that rural municipalities ended up with fewer local public services. I do not find the same effects for municipalities that had voluntarily integrated prior to the law, while both types of municipality enjoyed similar benefits in terms of public transport and fiscal revenues. These findings support the fact that municipalities resisted to avoid the local costs of integration.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230344

Using 2016 confidential firm-trade linked data, we identify exporters who were importing products that eventually faced tariff increases to construct product-level exposure to import tariffs. We find that the most exposed products had lower exports in 2018–2019, with the largest effects in 2019.

Chakrabarti, Kanika Mahajan and Shekhar Tomar","Firms are increasingly concerned about the resilience of their sales and sourcing decisions. Using administrative data, we show that a temporary disruption in trade due to state border closures in India led to a persistent trade collapse within the country—interstate trade relative to intrastate remains five percent lower even six months after all restrictions were lifted. Reshoring explains this phenomenon as plants more dependent on interstate sales (input-sourcing) shift from inter- to intrastate sales (input-sourcing). State borders rather than distance are salient in explaining the observed substitution. We propose a novel product-level measure that determines the extent of reshoring.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230270

To test the ETWFE, we estimate the effects of regional trade agreements (RTAs). The results suggest that RTA estimates in the current gravity literature may be biased downward (by more than 50 percent in our sample). Sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of our main findings and demonstrate the applicability of our methods across settings.

Our model accurately predicts earnings changes for CZ movers after accounting for firm sorting. Worker skills explain half of observed earnings differences across CZs; observable characteristics understate this. Industry composition explains little of average place effects.

AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Media Coverage of Immigration and the Polarization of Attitudes,Sarah Schneider-Strawczynski and Jérôme Valette,"This paper investigates the effect of media coverage on immigration attitudes. It combines data on immigration coverage in French television with individual panel data from 2013 to 2017 that records respondents' preferred television channel and attitudes toward immigration. The analysis focuses on within-individual variations over time, addressing ideological self-selection into channels. We find that increased coverage of immigration polarizes attitudes, with initially moderate individuals becoming more likely to report extremely positive and negative attitudes. This polarization is mainly driven by an increase in the salience of immigration, which reactivates pre-existing prejudices, rather than persuasion effects from biased news consumption.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230300
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Changes in Family Structure and Welfare Participation since the 1960s: The Role of Legal Services,Jamein Cunningham and Andrew Goodman-Bacon,"This paper evaluates the effects of the War on Poverty's legal services program (LSP), which provided subsidized legal assistance to poor communities, focusing on divorce and welfare access. We use a difference-in-difference (DiD) research design based on the program's rollout from 1965 to 1975. We find temporary increases in the rate of new divorces and persistent increases in welfare participation, consistent with LSP activities. We find increases in nonmarital birth rates that stem from falling marriage rates rather than rising birth rates. Expanded access to legal institutions thus contributed directly and indirectly to changes in family structure in the 1960s.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20210117

We exploit the reintroduction of the Spanish wealth tax, after which all regions except Madrid levied positive tax rates. We find the mobility responses to wealth taxes are within the range of prior estimates with respect to income taxes. However, wealth tax mobility responses generate losses to personal income tax revenues that are six times larger than the direct losses to wealth taxes.

Since parents may pass on their occupations to their children, we further describe patterns of intergenerational occupational following and show they vary substantially across occupations, with low-income occupations showing more persistence across generations on average. Yet, occupational persistence plays a limited role for income mobility, explaining only 10 percent of the income rank-rank relationship.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230403

However, there is little direct evidence on their effect on market choices. We provide causal evidence using a large-scale, high-stakes field experiment in the United States. We sent letters about home price trends to 57,910 homeowners who listed their homes. These letters contained randomized information creating nondeceptive, exogenous variation in home price expectations. Consistent with economic theory, higher expectations reduced selling probability. Behavior was highly elastic: a 1 percentage point increase in expectations caused a 2.63 percentage point reduction in the probability of selling the property within 12 weeks.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20230641
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Changes in Nutrient Intake at Retirement,Melvin Stephens and Desmond Toohey,"Prior research finds food expenditure decreases at retirement, which suggests households are inadequately saving. In contrast, other evidence shows that direct measures of food intake are unaffected by exiting the labor force. Using a wide array of data sources and methodologies, we find that food intake falls at retirement, including: declines in caloric and nutrient intake in cross-sectional datasets spanning 40 years, a decrease in caloric intake using longitudinal data, and a drop in a food intake index that relates diet composition to permanent income. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of life-cycle models of consumption.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20180378
AEJ: Applied Economics,2025,Digital Information Provision and Behavior Change: Lessons from Six Experiments in East Africa,"Raissa Fabregas, Michael Kremer, Matthew Lowes, Robert On and Giulia Zane","While some studies suggest mobile phone–based information programs change behavior; others find no effect. We evaluate six text message agricultural extension programs, collectively covering 128,000 farmers. A meta-analysis finds a 1.22-fold increase in the odds of adoption of recommended practices (95 percent CI: 1.16, 1.29). We cannot reject similar impacts across experiments. Impacts are increased by message repetition, but not by providing more granular information, using behavioral framings, or complementing texts with phone calls. There is little evidence of message fatigue or crowd-out. Despite modest absolute impacts detectable only with large samples or meta-analysis, texts are inexpensive enough to be cost-effective.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20220072
