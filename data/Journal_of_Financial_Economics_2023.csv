Journal of Financial Economics,2023,Partisanship in loan pricing,"Ramona Dagostino, Janet Gao and Pengfei Ma","Does partisanship influence the way investors price financial assets? Using voter registration data of bankers originating large corporate loans, we show that bankers whose party differs from that of the U.S. President charge 7% higher loan spreads than other bankers. This effect holds regardless of borrowers’ partisanship, and becomes stronger for politically active bankers and when partisan media exhibit greater disagreement. Bankers do not match disproportionately with co-partisan borrowers but they lead syndicates more frequently with co-partisan bankers. Our results are not driven by bank or borrower fundamentals, but suggest that investor optimism, driven by political alignment, shapes asset prices.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001575
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,CEO compensation: Evidence from the field,"Alex Edmans, Tom Gosling and Dirk Jenter","We survey directors and investors on the objectives, constraints, and determinants of CEO pay. We find that directors face constraints beyond participation and incentives, and that pay matters not to finance consumption but to address CEOs’ fairness concerns. 67% of directors would sacrifice shareholder value to avoid controversy, leading to lower levels and one-size-fits-all structures. Shareholders are the main source of constraints, suggesting directors and investors disagree on how to maximize value. Intrinsic motivation and reputation are seen as stronger motivators than incentive pay. Even with strong portfolio incentives, flow pay responds to performance to fairly recognize the CEO's contribution.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001587
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,Sorting out the effect of credit supply,"Briana Chang, Matthieu Gomez and Harrison Hong","We document that banks that cut lending more during the Great Recession were lending to riskier firms ex-ante. To understand the aggregate implications of this sorting pattern, we build an assignment model in which banks have heterogeneous costs to take on risky loans and firms have different credit risks. In the model, aggregate loan volume depends on the entire distribution of bank holding costs and firm credit risks. We then use our model to recover the change in the distribution of bank holding costs during the Great Recession and show that it explains two-thirds of the decline of aggregate loan volume during this period.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001599

We construct “net-long” and “net-short” curves that account for balance sheet and financing costs, and show that actual yields moved from the net short curve pre-GFC to the net long curve post-GFC. Our theory shows the regime shift caused negative swap spreads and co-movement among swap spreads, dealer positions, and covered-interest-parity violations. Furthermore, the effects of various monetary and regulatory policies are regime-dependent. We highlight Treasury supply as a plausible driver of this regime shift.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001629

We develop new model-free short-time risk-neutral variance expansions, allowing us to clearly delineate the importance of jumps in generating both price and variance risks. We find that simultaneous jumps in the price and the stochastic volatility and/or jump intensity of the market commands a sizeable risk premium. The existence of “jump leverage” risk premium may be rationalized in the context of equilibrium-based models by jumps in the conditional moments of the underlying fundamentals and/or changes in investors' risk aversion.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001630

This finding implies that TFP volatility should also predict real cash flows and/or real interest rates: it is found to mainly predict real cash flows through inflation. A model with endogenous growth, Epstein-Zin preferences and price rigidities reconciles both TFP volatility-driven long-run predictability and its real implications. Within the model, we justify the similar (to that of TFP volatility) predictive ability of a low-frequency notion of market volatility as well as the cross-sectional pricing of TFP volatility risk in alternative asset classes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001642

To explain these findings, we develop economically motivated restrictions in the context of a theory in which the pricing kernel is a general diffusion process with spanned and unspanned components. Our reconciliation is a framework that introduces market incompleteness and priced unspanned volatility risks, allowing for time-varying downside and upside futures risk premiums. The estimated model shows consistency with data on bond yields, yield volatilities, bond futures return volatilities, option prices, and option risk premiums.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001769

The methods unveil interactions in the relation between fund characteristics and future performance. For instance, past performance is a particularly strong predictor of future performance for more active funds.

We revisit these findings and provide evidence that common factor pricing in corporate bonds is exceedingly difficult to establish. Based on portfolio- and bond-level analyses, we demonstrate that previously proposed bond risk factors, with traded liquidity as the only marginal exception, do not have any incremental explanatory power over the corporate bond market factor. Consequently, this implies that the bond CAPM is not dominated by either traded- or nontraded-factor models in pairwise and multiple model comparison tests.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001393

In a natural experiment in which households can apply for free mortgage-repayment flexibility, I find that two-thirds of liquidity-constrained applicants with high-cost debt voluntarily restrict flexibility and forgo, on average, 4,070 EUR of low-cost liquidity. An overconsumption tendency reflecting self-control problems can explain the voluntary liquidity restrictions as well as the persistent liquidity constraints, the consumption drop at the predictable end of flexibility, and saving in other illiquid assets.

When they trade more aggressively, the price becomes less informative. Other investors who learn from prices, in turn, are less concerned about adverse selection and provide more liquidity, causing large investors to trade even more aggressively. This trading complementarity can engender three unconventional results: i) increased competition among large investors makes all investors worse off, ii) more precise private information reduces price informativeness, creating complementarities in information acquisition, and iii) multiple equilibria emerge.

We present both theory and evidence that, when lenders use fixed-cost technologies to screen borrowers, increased competition may increase rather than decrease interest rates in subprime consumer credit markets. In more competitive markets, lenders have lower market shares, and thus lower incentives to invest in screening. Thus, when markets are competitive, all lenders face a riskier pool of borrowers, which can lead interest rates to be higher.

As predicted by theory, realized and expected return differentials moved in opposite directions, initially widening and then narrowing. When inferred from market outcomes, firm resilience correlates mainly with exposure to social distancing: vulnerability to social distancing is priced in changes of firms’ expected returns, while measures of financial and environmental resilience are not.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001447

While in-sample predictive regressions with realized excess returns suggest that objective risk premia vary countercyclically with business-cycle and asset-valuation measures, subjective risk premia extracted from survey data are largely acyclical. Out-of-sample forecasts of excess returns exhibit a similar lack of cyclicality, which suggests that investors’ learning of forecasting relationships in real time may help explain the cyclicality gap.

Using a large-scale household dataset, we provide an explanation for this puzzling result that the anomalous negative risk-return relation is only confined to those stocks predominantly held by rich households, whereas the anomaly disappears for stocks held by non-rich households and institutional investors. We find that social status concern of rich households and the induced lottery preference explain wealthy investors’ demand for high-risk stocks, leading to overpricing and low future returns for such stocks.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001551

Journal of Financial Economics,2023,Cleansing by tight credit: Rational cycles and endogenous lending standards,Maryam Farboodi and Péter Kondor,"Endogenous cycles emerge through the two-way interaction between lending standards and production fundamentals. Lax lending standards in booms lead to low interest rates and high output but the deterioration of future loan quality. Low borrower quality in turn precipitates tight standards: the economy enters a recession with high credit spreads and low output but a gradual improvement in the quality of loans. This eventually triggers a shift back to a boom with lax lending, and the cycle continues. The capitalization of expert investors determines the strength of capital reallocation in recessions. Furthermore, although the constrained efficient economy is often cyclical, it features both a static and a dynamic externality in credit supply, hence differing from the decentralized equilibrium.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001241

We find that lenders pool high-value loans separately and trade them in a less liquid market. We estimate a model of MBS pooling and trading to study welfare implications of pooling policies. TBA market structure produces a trade-off between efficiency and equity; broader pooling increases liquidity and average welfare, but results in a larger cross-subsidy from smaller loans to larger loans.

Because housing supply is heterogeneous across space and more elastic in the long-run, the effects on rents and populations may differ over time. We use the lens of a spatial housing model with heterogeneous housing supply elasticities to identify the housing and location demand changes from 2020–2022, and show that the same shocks will have different effects in the long run. Even though rents and prices increased significantly in the short-run, we estimate that in the long-run, increased housing demand will increase rents by only 1.8 percentage points, and that changing location demand will decrease rents by 0.3 percentage points, with a more negative impact on cities in which CPI is measured and cities that were initially expensive.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23001265

Systematic default spikes during recessions, is correlated with macroeconomic indicators, and predicts future realized defaults.

Using a model to analyze slow and fast momentum strategies, we estimate both relatively high mean persistence and realization noise in U.S. stock market returns.

I build a model of multi-dealer platforms, where dealers strategically choose to respond to or ignore a request. If the customer contacts more dealers, each dealer responds with a lower probability and offers a stochastically worse price when responding. Dealers’ strategic avoidance of competition overturns the customer’s benefit from potentially receiving more quotes, worsening her best-overall price. In equilibrium, the customer contacts only two dealers.

Exploiting the 2005 BAPCPA rule change, which granted mortgage collateral preferred bankruptcy treatment, I find that strengthening creditor rights increases dealers’ collateral reuse. Increasing collateral reuse creates a money multiplier that increases credit supply.

As a consequence, the volatility of leverage is significantly higher than asset volatility over short horizons. At long horizons, the relation between leverage and asset volatility is reversed due to mean reversion in leverage. We incorporate these stochastic debt dynamics into structural models of credit risk, both standard diffusion models as well as newer models with stochastic volatility and jumps.

In this paper, we present evidence that the apparent demise of several prominent classes of stock market anomalies is better explained by changes in underlying fundamentals. The attenuation of anomalies in the Momentum, Investment, and Profitability categories are accompanied by a reduced difference in fundamental performance between the long- and short-leg portfolios, as measured by the fundamental return from a two-capital investment CAPM. After accounting for the change in fundamental return, the attenuation of Investment and Profitability anomalies decreases to statistically insignificant levels. These results are consistent with the q-theory of investment, which attributes the attenuation of stock returns and fundamental returns of anomalies to the time variation in discount rates implied by fundamentals.

Litigation financing bolsters the plaintiff, leading to larger deadweight losses.

Even in this systemically important market, where seemingly homogeneous repos trade, I document persistent rate differences paid by dealers. I characterize the Triparty market as cash-lenders allocating their portfolios among differentiated dealers who set repo rates. I find that cash-lenders’ aversion to portfolio concentration and preference for stable lending grant dealers substantial market power: between 2011 and 2017, dealers borrowed at rates that were 26 bps lower than their marginal value from intermediating the borrowed repo funds. Dealers’ market power makes the observed wholesale repo rate understate the financing rate available to market participants who rely on repo funding, and offers a novel explanation for funding spreads such as the Treasury cash-futures basis and the Treasury swap spread.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X23000673

Heterogeneous arbitrageurs – “fast” arbitrageurs with informational advantages and “slow” arbitrageurs with low inventory costs – compete to determine the price of liquidity. High information asymmetry around market open allows fast arbitrageurs to demand large price deviations for absorbing order imbalances, as cream-skimming risk discourages competition from slow arbitrageurs.

Using novel data that includes loan-level currency and the cost of credit, in addition to several other transaction-level characteristics, we re-examine the reasons behind dollar credit popularity. We find that a dollar-denominated loan has an interest rate that is 2 percentage points lower per year than a loan in local currency. Expectations of exchange rate movements do not explain this difference. We show that this interest rate differential for lending rates is closely matched by the differential in the deposit market. Our results suggest that the preference for dollar loans is rooted in the local depositors preference for dollar savings, and a banking sector that is strongly incentivized to closely match its foreign-currency assets and liabilities.

Industry-level analysis shows reduced productivity heterogeneity in more exposed industries, which is consistent with improved credit allocation.

The average postcrisis TFP growth of medium-sized, small, and micro firms was, respectively, 1.1, 2.9, and 5.4 percentage points lower than that of large firms. This SME productivity gap is larger for firms with more severe credit supply shocks. The gap is partially attributable to a larger postcrisis reduction in intangible capital at SMEs than at large firms. Horseraces suggest that SME indicators are more robust and more powerful predictors of postcrisis TFP growth than other indicators.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22002057
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,Do firms with specialized M&A staff make better acquisitions?,"Sinan Gokkaya, Xi Liu and René M. Stulz","We open the black box of the M&A decision process by examining whether specialized M&A staff, who perform a wide range of acquisition-related functions, improve acquisition performance. We find that the presence and the quality of specialized M&A staff is one of the most economically important determinants of acquisition performance. We explore mechanisms through which specialized M&A staff improve acquisition performance and investigate why only less than half of US firms employ such staff. Agency costs are a first-order determinant for specialized M&A staff's value-creation role. Such staff do not improve acquisition performance in firms with heightened agency conflicts.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001878
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,Presidential economic approval rating and the cross-section of stock returns,"Zilin Chen, Zhi Da, Dashan Huang and Liyao Wang","We construct a monthly presidential economic approval rating (PEAR) index from 1981 to 2019, by averaging ratings on the president’s handling of the economy across various national polls. In the cross-section, stocks with high betas to changes in the PEAR index significantly under-perform those with low betas by 1.00% per month in the future, on a risk-adjusted basis. The low PEAR beta premium persists up to one year, and is present in various sub-samples and even in other G7 countries. PEAR beta dynamically reveals a firm’s perceived alignment to the incumbent president’s economic policies and investors seem to misprice such an alignment.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22002240
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,Mutual fund performance at long horizons,"Hendrik Bessembinder, Michael J. Cooper and Feng Zhang","The percentage of U.S. equity mutual funds that outperform the SPY ETF over the last 30 years decreases substantially as the horizon over which returns are measured is increased. Further, some funds with positive monthly alpha estimates have negative long-horizon abnormal returns. These results reflect positive skewness in the distribution of fund returns that increases with horizon, and highlight the limitations of conditional arithmetic means of short-horizon returns (e.g., alpha) for long-horizon investors. We tabulate an aggregate wealth loss of $1.02 trillion to mutual fund investors over our 30-year sample, when opportunity costs are based on beta-adjusted SPY returns.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22002264
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,Collateral quality and intervention traps,Michael Junho Lee and Daniel Neuhann,"What determines the supply of good collateral? We study a dynamic model in which borrowers must exert effort to maintain collateral quality and markets become illiquid when average quality is too low. Average quality grows quickly when it is high initially, but deteriorates or grows slowly otherwise. As such, even long-run market conditions are sensitive to a wide array of fundamental and non-fundamental shocks. Recoveries from illiquidity can occur, but only if funding is inefficiently rationed for some time. Policymakers without commitment may fall into intervention traps in which ex-post efficient liquidity injections cause permanent declines in collateral quality.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22002252
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,Sovereign risk premia and global macroeconomic conditions,"Sandro C. Andrade, Adelphe Ekponon and Alexandre Jeanneret","We study how shifting global macroeconomic conditions affect sovereign bond prices. Bondholders earn premia for two sources of systematic risk: exposure to low-frequency changes in the state of the economy, as captured by expected macroeconomic growth and volatility, and exposure to higher-frequency macroeconomic shocks. Our model predicts that the first source, labeled long-run macro risk, is the primary driver of the level and the cross-sectional variation in sovereign bond premia. We find support for this prediction using sovereign bond return data for 43 countries over the 1994–2018 period. A long-short portfolio based on long-run macro risk earns 8.11% per year in our sample.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001489
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,"Institutional investors, the dollar, and U.S. credit conditions",Friederike Niepmann and Tim Schmidt-Eisenlohr,"A strong dollar has been associated with lower lending to emerging markets and tighter global financial conditions. This paper documents similar patterns for credit in the U.S. economy: when the U.S. broad dollar index appreciates by 1 percent, U.S. banks’ corporate loan originations fall by 4.5 percent, with banks tightening credit standards and lending to safer borrowers. This negative correlation, which we term the U.S. dollar credit channel, is at least in part driven by institutional investors, who reduce their demand for risky loans on the secondary loan market when the dollar appreciates. As it becomes harder to sell loans to these investors, banks lend less.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22001738
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,What are the events that shake our world? Measuring and hedging global COVOL,Robert Engle and Susana Campos-Martins,"Some events impact volatilities of most assets, asset classes, sectors and countries, causing serious damage to investment portfolios. The magnitude of such shocks is defined as global COVOL which is an abbreviation for global common volatility, a broad measure of all types of global financial risk. This paper introduces a statistical formulation of such events as common volatility innovations in both a multivariate volatility and an asset pricing context. Simulations verify the statistical performance of a simple but novel estimator and of a test to detect global COVOL. Two empirical examples show the events that have had the biggest impact on financial markets. The results are useful for portfolio optimization and risk forecasting.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X22002070
Journal of Financial Economics,2023,Industry asset revaluations around public and private acquisitions,"Francois Derrien, Laurent Frésard, Victoria Slabik and Philip Valta","Revaluations of industry peers around horizontal acquisitions are negative when targets are private, but positive when they are public. We posit this “revaluation spread” arises because acquiring managers favor private targets when public firms are overvalued. Targets’ ownership status thus conveys information about industry assets’ misvaluation and triggers predictable revaluations. Supporting this idea, private acquisitions occur when private targets appear “cheaper” than public firms based on valuation multiples or the trading activity of industry insiders. The revaluation spread varies with overall market misvaluation, predicts future industry returns, and is unrelated to peers’ and industries’ fundamentals.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21004426
