Journal of Econometrics,2025,The term structure of macroeconomic risks at the effective lower bound,Guillaume Roussellet,"This paper proposes a new macro-finance model that solves the tension between tractability, flexibility in macroeconomic dynamics, and consistency of the term structures of treasury yields with the effective lower bound (ELB). I use the term structures of U.S. nominal and real treasury yields from 1990 to explore the interdependence between inflation expectations, volatility, and monetary policy at the ELB. The estimation reveals that real yields stay elevated during the ELB due to large premia and deflation fears, produced by a persistent shift in inflation dynamics, with low average inflation and heightened inflation volatility.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407623000143
Journal of Econometrics,2025,When uncertainty and volatility are disconnected: Implications for asset pricing and portfolio performance,"Yacine Aït-Sahalia, Felix Matthys, Emilio Osambela and Ronnie Sircar","We analyze an environment where the uncertainty in the equity market return and its volatility are both stochastic and may be potentially disconnected. We solve a representative investor’s optimal asset allocation and derive the resulting conditional equity premium and risk-free rate in equilibrium. Our empirical analysis shows that the equity premium appears to be earned for facing uncertainty, especially high uncertainty that is disconnected from lower volatility, rather than for facing volatility as traditionally assumed. Incorporating the possibility of a disconnect between volatility and uncertainty significantly improves portfolio performance, over and above the performance obtained by conditioning on volatility only.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407623003706
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Score-type tests for normal mixtures,"Dante Amengual, Xinyue Bei, Marine Carrasco and Enrique Sentana","Testing normality against discrete normal mixtures is complex because some parameters turn increasingly underidentified along alternative ways of approaching the null, others are inequality constrained, and several higher-order derivatives become identically 0. These problems make the maximum of the alternative model log-likelihood function numerically unreliable. We propose score-type tests asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio as the largest of two simple intuitive statistics that only require estimation under the null. One novelty of our approach is that we treat symmetrically both ways of writing the null hypothesis without excluding any region of the parameter space. We derive the asymptotic distribution of our tests under the null and sequences of local alternatives. We also show that their asymptotic distribution is the same whether applied to observations or standardized residuals from heteroskedastic regression models. Finally, we study their power in simulations and apply them to the residuals of Mincer earnings functions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624000630
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Efficiency bounds for moment condition models with mixed identification strength,"Prosper Dovonon, Yves F. Atchadé and Firmin Doko Tchatoka","Moment condition models with mixed identification strength are models that are point identified but with estimating moment functions that are allowed to drift to 0 uniformly over the parameter space. Even though identification fails in the limit, depending on how slow the moment functions vanish, consistent estimation is possible. Existing estimators such as the generalized method of moment (GMM) estimator exhibit a pattern of nonstandard or even heterogeneous rate of convergence that materializes by some parameter directions being estimated at a slower rate than others. This paper derives asymptotic semiparametric efficiency bounds for regular estimators of parameters of these models. We show that GMM estimators are regular and that the so-called two-step GMM estimator – using the inverse of estimating function’s variance as weighting matrix – is semiparametrically efficient as it reaches the minimum variance attainable by regular estimators. This estimator is also asymptotically minimax efficient with respect to a large family of loss functions. Monte Carlo simulations are provided that confirm these results.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624000691
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Identification robust inference for the risk premium in term structure models,Frank Kleibergen and Lingwei Kong,"We propose identification robust statistics for testing hypotheses on the risk premia in dynamic affine term structure models. We do so using the moment equation specification proposed in Adrian et al. (2013). Statistical inference based on their three-stage estimator requires knowledge of the risk factors’ quality and can be misleading when the β’s are weak, which results when sampling errors are of comparable order of magnitude as the risk factor loadings. We extend the subset (factor) Anderson–Rubin test from Guggenberger et al. (2012) to models with multiple dynamic factors and time-varying risk prices. It provides a computationally tractable manner to conduct identification robust tests on a few risk premia when a larger number is present. We use it to analyze potential identification issues arising in the data from Adrian et al. (2013) for which we show that some factors, though potentially weak, may drive the time variation of risk prices, and weak identification issues are more prominent in multi-factor models.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624000745
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Spanning latent and observable factors,"E. Andreou, P. Gagliardini, E. Ghysels and M. Rubin","Factor analysis is a widely used tool to summarize high dimensional panel data via a small dimensional set of latent factors. Many applications in finance and macroeconomics, are often focused on observable factors with an economic interpretation. The objective of this paper is to provide a test to answer a question which naturally comes up in discussions regarding latent versus observable factors: do latent and observable factors span the same space? We derive asymptotic properties of a formal test and propose a bootstrap version with improved small sample properties. We find empirical evidence for a small number of factors common between a small number of traditional Fama–French risk factors – or returns on a few stocks (i.e. “magnificent” 5 or 7) – and large panels of US, North American and international portfolio returns.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624000897
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Regularizing stock return covariance matrices via multiple testing of correlations,Richard Luger,"This paper develops a large-scale inference approach for the regularization of stock return covariance matrices. The framework allows for the presence of heavy tails and multivariate GARCH-type effects of unknown form among the stock returns. The approach involves simultaneous testing of all pairwise correlations, followed by setting non-statistically significant elements to zero. This adaptive thresholding is achieved through sign-based Monte Carlo resampling within multiple testing procedures, controlling either the traditional familywise error rate, a generalized familywise error rate, or the false discovery proportion. Subsequent shrinkage ensures that the final covariance matrix estimate is positive definite and well-conditioned while preserving the achieved sparsity. Compared to alternative estimators, this new regularization method demonstrates strong performance in simulation experiments and real portfolio optimization.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762400099X
Journal of Econometrics,2025,The chained difference-in-differences,"Christophe Bellégo, David Benatia and Vincent Dortet-Bernadet","This paper studies the identification, estimation, and inference of long-term (binary) treatment effect parameters when balanced panel data is not available, or consists of only a subset of the available data. We develop a new estimator: the chained difference-in-differences, which leverages the overlapping structure of many unbalanced panel data sets. This approach consists in aggregating a collection of short-term treatment effects estimated on multiple incomplete panels. Our estimator accommodates (1) multiple time periods, (2) variation in treatment timing, (3) treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) general missing data patterns, and (5) sample selection on observables. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and discuss identification and efficiency gains in comparison to existing methods. Finally, we illustrate its relevance through (i) numerical simulations, and (ii) an application about the effects of an innovation policy in France.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624001295
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Simulation-based estimation with many auxiliary statistics applied to long-run dynamic analysis,Bertille Antoine and Wenqian Sun,The existing asymptotic theory for estimators obtained by simulated minimum distance does not cover situations in which the number of components of the auxiliary statistics (or number of matched “moments”) is large — typically larger than the sample size. We establish the consistency of the simulated minimum distance estimator in this situation and derive its asymptotic distribution.,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762400160X
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Exogeneity tests and weak identification in IV regressions: Asymptotic theory and point estimation,Firmin Doko Tchatoka and Jean-Marie Dufour,"This paper provides new insights on exogeneity tests in linear IV models and their use for estimation, when identification fails or may not be strong. We make two main contributions. First, we show that Durbin–Wu–Hausman (DWH) and Revankar–Hartley (RH) exogeneity tests have correct level asymptotically, even when the first-stage coefficient matrix (which controls identification) is rank-deficient. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which these tests are consistent. In particular, we show that test consistency can hold even when identification fails, provided at least one component of the structural parameter vector is identifiable. Second, we study point estimation after estimator (or model) selection, when the outcome of a DWH/RH test determines whether OLS or an IV method is employed in the second-stage. For this purpose, we use (non-local) concepts of asymptotic bias, asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE), and asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE), which remain applicable even when the estimators considered do not have moments (as can happen for 2SLS) or may be inconsistent. We study the asymptotic properties of OLS, 2SLS, and pretest estimators which select OLS or 2SLS based on the outcome of a DWH/RH test. We show that: (i) OLS typically dominates 2SLS estimator asymptotically for MSE across a broad spectrum of cases, including weak identification and moderate endogeneity; (ii) exogeneity-pretest estimators exhibit consistently good performance and asymptotically dominate both OLS and 2SLS. The proposed theoretical findings are documented by Monte Carlo simulations.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624001660
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Conditional spectral methods,Federico M. Bandi and Yinan Su,"We model predictive scale-specific cycles. By employing suitable matrix representations, we express the forecast errors of covariance-stationary multivariate time series in terms of conditionally orthonormal scale-specific bases. The representations yield conditionally orthogonal decompositions of these forecast errors. They also provide decompositions of their variances and betas in terms of scale-specific variances and betas capturing predictive variability and co-variability over cycles of alternative lengths without spillovers across cycles. Making use of the proposed representations within the classical family of time-varying conditional volatility models, we document the role of time-varying volatility forecasts in generating orthogonal predictive scale-specific cycles in returns. We conclude by providing suggestive evidence that the conditional variances of the predictive return cycles (i) may be priced over short-to-medium horizons and (ii) may offer economically-relevant trading signals over these same horizons.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002082
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Weak identification in discrete choice models,"David T. Frazier, Eric Renault, Lina Zhang and Xueyan Zhao","We study the impact of weak identification in discrete choice models, and provide insights into the determinants of identification strength in these models. Using these insights, we propose a novel test that can consistently detect weak identification in commonly applied discrete choice models, such as probit, logit, and many of their extensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the null hypothesis of weak identification is rejected, Wald-based inference can be carried out using standard formulas and critical values. A Monte Carlo study compares our proposed testing approach against commonly applied weak identification tests. The results simultaneously demonstrate the good performance of our approach and the fundamental failure of using conventional weak identification tests for linear models in the discrete choice model context. Lastly, we apply our approach in two empirical examples: married women labor force participation, and US food aid and civil conflicts.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002112

Households participate in financial markets with a certain probability that depends on their individual income and on asset market conditions. We use indirect inference to uncover individual asset market participation from individual consumption data and asset prices. Our model very accurately reproduces the proportions of stockholders in the Survey of Consumer Finances over three-year intervals, provides a reasonable estimate of stock market participation costs, and is able to price characteristic-based stock portfolios with the top decile of households identified as stockholders.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002124

The model represents a process containing unobserved short and long-run components measured on different time scales. The short-run component is defined in calendar time, while the long-run component evolves in rescaled time with ultra-long units. We develop estimation and long-run prediction methods for time series with multivariate Vector Autoregressive (VAR) short-run components and reveal the impossibility of estimating consistently some of the long-run parameters, which causes significant estimation and prediction risks in the long run. A simulation study and an application to macroeconomic data illustrate the approach.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002562

Exploiting the information from the cross-sectional intercept allows us to impose or formally test model-consistent restrictions, including those resulting from traded factors in excess of the zero beta-rate or from return spreads. Analytical projection-based solutions for confidence set outcomes are developed. The proposed procedures are extended to the case of missing factors. Empirical and simulation results with traded and non-traded factors show that model-consistent restrictions and elusive factors can materially affect model fit, identification, inference and temporal constancy of pricing influence.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002665
Journal of Econometrics,2025,Functional ecological inference,"Christian Bontemps, Jean-Pierre Florens and Nour Meddahi","In this paper, we consider the problem of ecological inference when one observes the conditional distributions of Y|W and Z|W from aggregate data and attempts to infer the conditional distribution of Y|Z without observing Y and Z in the same sample. First, we show that this problem can be transformed into a linear equation involving operators for which, under suitable regularity assumptions, least squares solutions are available. We then propose the use of the least squares solution with the minimum Hilbert–Schmidt norm, which, in our context, can be structurally interpreted as the solution with minimum dependence between Y and Z. Interestingly, in the case where the conditioning variable W is discrete and belongs to a finite set, such as the labels of units/groups/cities, the solution of this minimal dependence has a closed form. In the more general case, we use a regularization scheme and show the convergence of our proposed estimator. A numerical evaluation of our procedure is proposed.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002690

Journal of Econometrics,2025,Identifying the volatility risk price through the leverage effect,"Xu Cheng, Eric Renault and Paul Sangrey","In asset pricing models with stochastic volatility, uncertainty about volatility affects risk premia through two channels: aversion to decreasing returns and aversion to increasing volatility. We analyze the identification of and robust inference for structural parameters measuring investors’ aversions to these risks: the return risk price and the volatility risk price. In the presence of a leverage effect (instantaneous causality between the asset return and its volatility), we study the identification of both structural parameters with the price data only, without relying on additional option pricing models or option data. We analyze this identification challenge in a nonparametric discrete-time exponentially affine model, complementing the continuous-time approach of Bandi and Renò (2016). We then specialize to a parametric model and derive the implied minimum distance criterion relating the risk prices to the asset return and volatility’s joint distribution. This criterion is almost flat when the leverage effect is small, and we introduce identification-robust confidence sets for both risk prices regardless of the magnitude of the leverage effect.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762400294X

Journal of Econometrics,2025,Natural disasters as macroeconomic tail risks,Sulkhan Chavleishvili and Emanuel Moench,"We introduce quantile and moment impulse response functions for structural quantile vector autoregressive models. We use them to study how climate-related natural disasters affect the predictive distribution of output growth and inflation. Disasters strongly shift the forecast distribution particularly in the tails. They result in an initial sharp increase of the downside risk for growth, followed by a temporary rebound. Upside risk to inflation increases markedly for a few months and then subsides. As a result, natural disasters have a persistent impact on the conditional variance and skewness of macroeconomic aggregates which standard linear models estimating conditional mean dynamics fail to match. We perform a scenario analysis to evaluate the hypothetical effects of more frequent large disasters on the macroeconomy due to increased atmospheric carbon concentration. Our results indicate a substantially higher conditional volatility of growth and inflation as well as increased upside risk to inflation particularly in a scenario where only currently pledged climate policies are implemented.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002653

In particular, we establish its first-order asymptotic validity for West-type (1996) tests of predictive ability in the presence of regular data revisions. This allows the user to conduct asymptotically valid inference without having to estimate the asymptotic variances derived in Clark and McCracken’s (2009) extension of West (1996) when data are subject to revision. Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the bootstrap can provide satisfactory finite sample size and power even in modest sample sizes. We conclude with an application to inflation forecasting that revisits the results in Ang et al.

Journal of Econometrics,2025,Modelling large dimensional datasets with Markov switching factor models,Matteo Barigozzi and Daniele Massacci,"We study a novel large dimensional approximate factor model with regime changes in the loadings driven by a latent first order Markov process. By exploiting the equivalent linear representation of the model, we first recover the latent factors by means of Principal Component Analysis. We then cast the model in state–space form, and we estimate loadings and transition probabilities through an EM algorithm based on a modified version of the Baum–Lindgren–Hamilton–Kim filter and smoother that makes use of the factors previously estimated. Our approach is appealing as it provides closed form expressions for all estimators. More importantly, it does not require knowledge of the true number of factors. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed estimation procedure, and we show their good finite sample performance through a comprehensive set of Monte Carlo experiments. The empirical usefulness of our approach is illustrated through three applications to large U.S. datasets of stock returns, macroeconomic variables, and inflation indexes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002707
Journal of Econometrics,2025,On testing for spatial or social network dependence in panel data allowing for network variability,Xiaodong Liu and Ingmar R. Prucha,"The paper introduces robust generalized Moran I tests for network-generated cross-sectional dependence in a panel data setting where unit-specific effects can be random or fixed. Network dependence may originate from endogenous variables, exogenous variables, and/or disturbances, and the network dependence is allowed to vary over time. The formulation of the test statistics also aims at accommodating situations where the researcher is unsure about the exact nature of the network. Unit-specific effects are eliminated using the Helmert transformation, which is well known to yield time-orthogonality for linear forms of transformed disturbances. Given the specification of our test statistics, these orthogonality properties also extend to the quadratic forms that underlie our test statistics. This greatly simplifies the expressions for the asymptotic variances of our test statistics and their estimation. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the generalized Moran I tests introduced in this paper have the proper size and can provide substantial improvement in robustness when the researcher faces uncertainty about the specification of the network topology.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002768
Journal of Econometrics,2025,"Individual welfare analysis: Random quasilinear utility, independence, and confidence bounds",Junlong Feng and Sokbae (Simon) Lee,"We introduce a novel framework for individual-level welfare analysis. It builds on a parametric model for continuous demand with a quasilinear utility function, allowing for heterogeneous coefficients and unobserved individual-good-level preference shocks. We obtain bounds on the individual-level consumer welfare loss at any confidence level due to a hypothetical price increase, solving a scalable optimization problem constrained by a novel confidence set under an independence restriction. This confidence set is computationally simple and robust to weak instruments, nonlinearity, and partial identification. The validity of the confidence set is guaranteed by our new results on the joint limiting distribution of the independence test by Chatterjee (2021). These results together with the confidence set may have applications beyond welfare analysis.

Applications in economics and finance are numerous. We define a general dynamic framework for the risk factors, allowing us to obtain explicit expressions of the corresponding dynamic SRM. We deduce an easy-to-implement statistical approach which, based on semi-parametric assumptions, reduces to estimating univariate location-scale models and to computing (static) quantiles of the residuals. We derive a sound asymptotic theory (including confidence intervals, tests, validity of a residual bootstrap) for major SRM, namely the Conditional VaR (CoVaR) and Delta-CoVaR.

Journal of Econometrics,2025,Shrinkage estimators for periodic autoregressions,Richard Paap and Philip Hans Franses,"A periodic autoregression [PAR] is a seasonal time series model where the autoregressive parameters vary over the seasons. A drawback of PAR models is that the number of parameters increases dramatically when the number of seasons gets large. Hence, one needs many periods with intra-seasonal data to be able to get reliable parameter estimates. Therefore, these models are rarely applied for weekly or daily observations. In this paper we propose shrinkage estimators which shrink the periodic autoregressive parameters to a common value determined by the data. We derive the asymptotic properties of these estimators in case of a quadratic penalty and we illustrate the bias–variance trade-off. Empirical illustrations show that shrinkage improves forecasting with PAR models.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407624002884

The Gaussian shadow rate model with a linear or quadratic shadow rate is unable to explain this change in return predictability. The same holds for the quadratic term structure model and the autoregressive gamma-zero model that also enforce the ZLB.

We show that their methodology for the 2SLS estimator applies to a class of linear generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators with an associated class of generalized effective F-statistics. The standard robust F-statistic is a member of this class. The associated GMMf estimator, with the extension “f” for first-stage, has the weight matrix based on the first-stage residuals.
