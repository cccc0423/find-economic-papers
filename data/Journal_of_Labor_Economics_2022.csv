Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Rent Sharing within Firms,David Cho and Alan Krueger,This study investigates the extent to which economic rents are shared among different types of workers within firms. We utilize administrative payroll records in order to estimate the elasticity of employee compensation with respect to the price of crude oil at petroleum extraction companies. We find that the elasticity of rent sharing is heterogeneous within firms and significantly higher for workers at the top of the earnings distribution. These results can be rationalized by a bargaining model in which insiders within a firm possess greater power to negotiate over wages.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718713
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,The Intergenerational Transmission of Human Capital: Evidence from the Golden Age of Upward Mobility,"David Card, Ciprian Domnisoru and Lowell Taylor","School quality affects upward mobility in educational attainment. This conclusion comes from an analysis of families with coresident teenage children in the 1940 census. We study parents in the bottom quartile of the education distribution and define “upward mobility” as a generational move up the educational ladder to the top three quartiles of the child’s cohort. At the state level, upward mobility is strongly tied to teacher wages. This relationship holds when we narrow our focus to families on adjacent sides of state borders in the South, where state minimum salary laws created sharp teacher-wage differences between otherwise similar counties.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718417
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Machine Labor,Joshua Angrist and Brigham Frandsen,"The utility of machine learning (ML) for regression-based causal inference is illustrated by using lasso to select control variables for estimates of college characteristics’ wage effects. Post-double-selection lasso offers a path to data-driven sensitivity analysis. ML also seems useful for an instrumental variables (IV) first stage, since two-stage least squares (2SLS) bias reflects overfitting. While ML-based instrument selection can improve on 2SLS, split-sample IV and limited information maximum likelihood do better. Finally, we use ML to choose IV controls. Here, ML creates artificial exclusion restrictions, generating spurious findings. On balance, ML seems ill-suited to IV applications in labor economics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717933
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Does Money Still Matter? Attainment and Earnings Effects of Post-1990 School Finance Reforms,Jesse Rothstein and Diane Schanzenbach,"In two 1992 papers, Card and Krueger used labor market outcomes to study the productivity of school spending. Following their lead, we examine the effects of post-1990 school finance reforms on students’ educational attainment and labor market outcomes. Using a state-by-cohort panel design, we find that reforms increased high school completion and college-going, concentrated among Black students and women, and raised annual earnings. The reforms also increased the return to education, particularly for Black students and men, driven by the return to high school.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717934
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,"Minimum Wages, Wages, and Price Pass-Through: The Case of McDonald’s Restaurants",Orley Ashenfelter and Stepan Jurajda,"Based on 2016–20 hourly wage rates of McDonald’s basic crew and Big Mac prices collected simultaneously from almost all US McDonald’s, we find that in 25% of instances of minimum wage increases, restaurants keep constant their wage premium above the increasing minimum wage. Higher minimum wages are not associated with faster adoption of touch-screen ordering, and there is near-full price pass-through of minimum wages. Minimum wage hikes lead to increases in real wages (expressed as how many Big Macs 1 hour of basic crew work can buy) that are one-fifth lower than the corresponding increases in nominal wages.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718190
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Seeing beyond the Trees: Using Machine Learning to Estimate the Impact of Minimum Wages on Labor Market Outcomes,"Doruk Cengiz, Arindrajit Dube, Attila Lindner and David Zentler-Munro","We assess the effect of the minimum wage on labor market outcomes. First, we apply modern machine learning tools to predict who is affected by the policy. Second, we implement an event study using 172 prominent minimum wage increases between 1979 and 2019. We find a clear increase in wages of affected workers and no change in employment. Furthermore, minimum wage increases have no effect on the unemployment rate, labor force participation, or labor market transitions. Overall, these findings provide little evidence of changing search effort in response to a minimum wage increase.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718497
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Why Do Sectoral Employment Programs Work? Lessons from WorkAdvance,"Lawrence Katz, Jonathan Roth, Richard Hendra and Kelsey Schaberg","This paper examines the evidence from randomized evaluations of sector-focused training programs that target low-wage workers and combine up-front screening, occupational and soft-skills training, and wraparound services. The programs generate substantial and persistent earnings gains (12%–34%) following training. Theoretical mechanisms for program impacts are explored for the WorkAdvance demonstration. Earnings gains are generated by getting participants into higher-wage jobs in higher-earning industries and occupations, not just by raising employment. Training in transferable and certifiable skills (likely underprovided from poaching concerns) and reductions of employment barriers to high-wage sectors for nontraditional workers appear to play key roles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717932
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Artificial Intelligence and Jobs: Evidence from Online Vacancies,"Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, Jonathon Hazell and Pascual Restrepo","We study the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on labor markets using establishment-level data on the near universe of online vacancies in the United States from 2010 onward. There is rapid growth in AI-related vacancies over 2010–18 that is driven by establishments whose workers engage in tasks compatible with AI’s current capabilities. As these AI-exposed establishments adopt AI, they simultaneously reduce hiring in non-AI positions and change the skill requirements of remaining postings. While visible at the establishment level, the aggregate impacts of AI-labor substitution on employment and wage growth in more exposed occupations and industries is currently too small to be detectable.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718327
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Nonlinear Class Size Effects on Cognitive and Noncognitive Development of Young Children,Marie Connolly and Catherine Haeck,"We estimate the nonlinear impact of class size on student achievement by exploiting regulations that cap class size at 20 students per class in kindergarten. Based on student-level information from a previously unexploited and unique large-scale census survey of kindergarten students, this study provides clear evidence of the nonlinearity of class size effects on development measures. While the effects are largest on cognitive development, class size reductions also improve noncognitive skills for children living in disadvantaged areas. These findings suggest that sizeable class size reductions targeted at disadvantaged areas would achieve better results than a marginal reduction across the board.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718328
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Elite Schools and Opting In: Effects of College Selectivity on Career and Family Outcomes,"Suqin Ge, Elliott Isaac and Amalia Miller","Using College and Beyond data and a variant of Dale and Krueger’s matched-applicant approach, we revisit the question of how attending an elite college affects later-life outcomes. We expand the scope by examining additional outcomes and not restricting the sample to full-time workers. For men, controlling for selection eliminates the relationship between college selectivity and earnings; there are also no effects on men’s educational attainment or family outcomes. We find significant effects for women: attending a school with a 100-point-higher average SAT score increases women’s probability of advanced degree attainment and earnings while reducing their likelihood of marriage.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717931
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Childcare over the Business Cycle,Jessica H. Brown and Chris M. Herbst,"We estimate the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the childcare market. We find that the industry is substantially more exposed to the business cycle than other low-wage industries and responds more strongly to negative shocks than positive ones. Indeed, childcare employment requires more time to recover than the rest of the economy. Although the reduction in supply may pose difficulties for parents, we find evidence that center quality is countercyclical. When unemployment rates are higher, childcare workers have on average higher levels of education and experience, turnover rates are lower, and consumer reviews on Yelp are higher.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718189
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Wage Posting or Wage Bargaining? A Test Using Dual Jobholders,"Marta Lachowska, Alexandre Mas, Raffaele Saggio and Stephen Woodbury","We employ a revealed preference test to distinguish between wage posting and wage bargaining. Using a sample of dual jobholders in Washington State, we estimate the sensitivity of wages and separation rates to wage shocks in a secondary job. In lower parts of the wage distribution, improvements in the outside option lead to higher separations rates but not to higher wages, consistent with wage posting. In the highest wage quartile, improved outside options translate to higher wages but not higher separation rates, consistent with bargaining. In the aggregate, bargaining appears to be a limited determinant of wage setting.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718321
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,"Name Your Friends, but Only Five? The Importance of Censoring in Peer Effects Estimates Using Social Network Data",Alan Griffith,"Empirical peer effects research often employs censored peer data. Individuals may list only a fixed number of links, implying mismeasured peer variables. I first document that censoring is widespread in network data. I then introduce an estimator and characterize its inconsistency analytically; an assumption on the ordering of peers implies that censoring causes attenuated peer effects estimates. Next, I demonstrate the effect of censoring in two data sets, showing that estimates with censored data underestimate peer influence. I discuss interpretation of estimates, propose methods for correction and bounding, and give implications for the design of network surveys.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717935
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Matching in the Dark? Inequalities in Student to Degree Match,"Stuart Campbell, Lindsey Macmillan, Richard Murphy and Gill Wyness","This paper examines inequalities in the match between student and degree quality using linked administrative data from schools, universities, and tax authorities. We analyze two measures of match at the university subject level: undergraduate enrollment qualifications and graduate earnings. We find for both that disadvantaged students match to lower-quality degrees across the entire distribution of achievement in a setting with uniform fees and a generous financial aid system. While there are negligible gender gaps in academic match, high-attaining women systematically undermatch in terms of expected earnings, driven by subject choice. These inequalities in match are largest among the most undermatched.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718433
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,"Specialization, Comparative Advantage, and the Sexual Division of Labor",Peter Siminski and Rhiannon Yetsenga,"Recent work situates gender norms as a key driver of the sexual division of labor. But the explanatory power of Becker’s comparative advantage explanation is still not well understood. Drawing on unique data, we test the predictions of a formal Beckerian model. We complement this by proposing and analyzing new measures of specialization. We show that comparative advantage plays little or no role in the sexual division of labor within couple households. Absolute advantage also plays no role in specialization for same-sex couples, and this is not explained by having fewer children.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718430
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,"Empowerment, Task Commitment, and Performance Pay",Michael Beckmann and Matthias Kräkel,"Although from the viewpoint of social psychology task commitment is a driving force for intrinsic motivation in the workplace, this topic has been widely ignored in labor and personnel economics so far. Our paper reduces this gap in the literature by offering a theoretical analysis of worker empowerment and task commitment. This approach also helps to explain the observed variety of compensation schemes across workers and firms. By using a large-scale linked employer-employee panel data set, we present empirical evidence that is consistent with the predicted patterns of our theoretical model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718465
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Scaring or Scarring? Labor Market Effects of Criminal Victimization,Anna Bindler and Nadine Ketel,"Little is known about the costs of crime to victims. We use unique and detailed register data on victimizations and monthly labor market outcomes from the Netherlands and estimate event study designs to assess short- and long-term effects of criminal victimization. Across offenses, both males and females experience significant decreases in earnings (up to −12.9%) and increases in benefit receipt (up to +6%) after victimization. The negative labor market responses are lasting (up to 4 years) and accompanied by shorter-lived responses in health expenditure. Heterogeneity results suggest that most groups of victims, including the noninjured, suffer nontrivial losses.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718515
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,What Causes the Child Penalty? Evidence from Adopting and Same-Sex Couples,Martin Andresen and Emily Nix,"New parenthood causes large decreases in labor market incomes for mothers but not fathers, a stylized fact known as the “child penalty.” We combine a simple household model with estimates of child penalties in heterosexual nonadopting, adopting, and same-sex couples to better understand what causes the child penalty in heterosexual nonadopting couples. Our results largely rule out giving birth and the father’s advantage in the labor market as mechanisms, leaving preferences, gender norms, and discrimination as the main explanations. In addition, our paper provides novel evidence on the impact of children on labor market outcomes of adopting and same-sex couples.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718565
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Reconciling Occupational Mobility in the Current Population Survey,"Christian vom Lehn, Cache Ellsworth and Zachary Kroff","Measuring occupational mobility from the Current Population Survey using retrospective or longitudinal methods generates substantially different outcomes, in both levels and trends. Using a generalized method of moments technique, we estimate the level of occupational mobility and the measurement error in both of these measures for 1981–2018. We estimate that occupational mobility has been trending down, particularly since 2000, consistent with retrospective measures of occupational mobility. However, estimated mobility is 2–3 percentage points or 60%–70% higher than retrospective measures. Measurement error in longitudinal measures is large and has been worsening over time.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/718563
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,World War II and Black Economic Progress,Andreas Ferrara,"During the 1940s, a substantial share of southern Black men moved from low-skilled to much better paying semiskilled jobs. Using newly digitized military data, I show that counties with higher World War II casualty rates among semiskilled White soldiers saw an increase in the share of semiskilled Black workers. These deaths opened new employment opportunities for Black southerners and, together with learning effects by employers, can explain 35% of the occupational upgrading at mid-century. I provide evidence that the casualty-induced labor shortages reduced racial barriers to entry, leading to a positive selection of Black workers into semiskilled employment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716921
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,A Pay Change and Its Long-Term Consequences,Miriam Krueger and Guido Friebel,"In a professional services firm, top management unexpectedly adjusted the pay of consultants in some divisions to the pay in other divisions. In this quasi experiment, fixed wages increased and bonuses decreased, reducing pay for the high performers and increasing it for the low performers. Individual outputs and efforts decreased by 30%, and attrition and absenteeism increased. The effects were driven by those who were rationally expecting to lose from the pay change. Observing a period of more than 3 years, we show long-term negative reciprocity of those affected but no negative selection effects of new hires.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717728
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,The Earned Income Tax Credit and Maternal Time Use: More Time Working and Less Time with Kids?,Jacob Bastian and Lance Lochner,"Parents spend considerable time and resources investing in their children’s development. Given evidence that the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) affects maternal labor supply, we investigate how the maximum available EITC amount affects a broad array of time use activities, focusing on the amount and nature of time spent with children. Using 2003–18 time use data, we find that federal and state EITC expansions increase maternal work time, reducing time devoted to home production, leisure, and time with children. However, almost none of the reduction comes from time devoted to “investment” activities, such as active learning and development activities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717729
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Does Ageist Language in Job Ads Predict Age Discrimination in Hiring?,"Ian Burn, Patrick Button, Luis Munguia Corella and David Neumark","We study ageist stereotypes reflected in job-ad language and age discrimination in hiring, exploiting job-ad text and evidence on age discrimination from a correspondence study. We develop and use methods from computational linguistics and machine learning. We find that language related to stereotypes of older workers sometimes predicts hiring discrimination against older men. This is the case for all three categories of age stereotypes we consider—health, personality, and skill. For women, we find that age stereotypes about personality predict differential hiring by age. The evidence for men is quite consistent with the industrial psychology literature on age stereotypes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717730
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,"Less Competition, More Meritocracy?",Dawei Fang and Thomas Noe,"Uncompetitive contests for grades, promotions, retention, and job assignments, which feature lax standards and limited candidate pools, are often criticized for being unmeritocratic. We show that when contestants are strategic, lax standards and exclusivity can make selection more meritocratic. When many contestants compete for a few promotions, strategic contestants adopt high-risk strategies. Risk-taking reduces the correlation between performance and ability. Through reducing the effects of risk-taking, “Peter principle” promotion policies, which entail promoting some contestants that are unlikely to be worthy, can increase the overall correlation between selection and ability and thus further meritocracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716920
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Did Timing Matter? Life Cycle Differences in Effects of Exposure to the Great Recession,Kevin Rinz,"I estimate the effects of exposure to the Great Recession on employment and earnings for groups defined by year of birth over the 10 years following the beginning of the recession. Younger workers experience the largest earnings losses in percentage terms (up to 13%), in part because they remain less likely to work for high-paying employers even as their overall employment recovers more quickly than that of older workers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716346
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,The Relative Effectiveness of Teachers and Learning Software: Evidence from a Field Experiment in El Salvador,"Konstantin Büchel, Martina Jakob, Christoph Kühnhanss, Daniel Steffen and Aymo Brunetti","This study provides evidence on the relative effectiveness of computer-assisted learning (CAL) software and traditional teaching. Based on a field experiment in Salvadoran primary schools, we evaluate three interventions that aim to improve learning in mathematics: (i) additional teacher-led classes, (ii) additional CAL classes monitored by a supervisor, and (iii) additional CAL classes instructed by a teacher. We find that CAL lessons lead to larger learning gains and are less sensitive to class size as well as student ability than teacher-centered classes. Our results highlight the value of CAL in an environment with heterogeneous classes and poorly qualified teachers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717727
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Why Do Women Earn Less than Men? Evidence from Bus and Train Operators,Valentin Bolotnyy and Natalia Emanuel,"Female workers earn $0.89 for each male-worker dollar even in a unionized workplace, where tasks, wages, and promotion schedules are identical for men and women by design. Using administrative time-card data on bus and train operators, we show that this earnings gap can be explained by female operators taking fewer hours of overtime and more hours of unpaid time off than male operators. Female operators, especially those with dependents, pursue schedule conventionality, predictability, and controllability more than male operators. While reducing schedule controllability can limit the earnings gap, it can also hurt female workers and their productivity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715835
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Does Minimum Wage Increase Labor Productivity? Evidence from Piece Rate Workers,Hyejin Ku,"I examine worker effort as a potential margin of adjustment to a minimum wage hike using unique data on piece rate workers who perform a homogenous task and whose individual output is rigorously recorded. By employing a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits the increase in Florida’s minimum wage from $6.79 to $7.21 on January 1, 2009, and worker location on the pre-2009 productivity distribution, I provide evidence consistent with incumbent workers’ positive effort responses.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716347
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,The Effect of Grade Retention on Adult Crime: Evidence from a Test-Based Promotion Policy,"Ozkan Eren, Michael Lovenheim and H. Naci Mocan","We present the first analysis of the effect of grade retention on adult criminal convictions, exploiting test cutoffs for ninth-grade promotion in Louisiana. Eighth-grade retention increases the likelihood of violent crime conviction by 1.05 percentage points (58.44%) and increases the number of violent crime convictions at first conviction. The effects are likely driven by declines in high school peer quality and reduced educational investments that result in lower noncognitive skill acquisition. Extrapolating effects away from the cutoff shows that our results are generalizable to a larger group of low-performing students and are evident for both property and drug crimes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715836
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Nevertheless She Persisted? Gender Peer Effects in Doctoral STEM Programs,Valerie Bostwick and Bruce Weinberg,"We study the effects of peer gender composition in STEM doctoral programs on persistence and degree completion. Leveraging unique new data and quasi-random variation in gender composition across cohorts within programs, we show that women entering cohorts with no female peers are 11.7 percentage points less likely to graduate within 6 years than their male counterparts. A 1 standard deviation increase in the percentage of female students differentially increases women’s probability of on-time graduation by 4.4 percentage points. These gender peer effects function primarily through changes in the probability of dropping out in a PhD program’s first year.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714921
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,"World War II, the Baby Boom, and Employment: County-Level Evidence",Abel Brodeur and Lamis Kattan,"This paper examines the impact of male casualties due to World War II on fertility and female employment in the United States. We rely on the number of casualties at the county level and use a difference-in-differences strategy. While most counties in the United States experienced a baby boom following the war, we find that the increase in fertility was lower in high-casualty-rate counties than in low-casualty-rate counties. Analyzing the channels through which male casualties could have decreased fertility, we provide evidence that county male casualties are positively related to 1950s female employment and household income.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715485
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Constraints on Hours within the Firm,Claudio Labanca and Dario Pozzoli,"Firms often impose constraints on working hours. While many believe that these constraints shape labor supply decisions, little evidence exists to support such views. We explore this relationship using linked employer-employee data on hours worked and the variation in tax rates derived from the 2010 Danish tax reform. We show that hours worked are unresponsive to individual tax changes in firms with strict constraints, whereas they respond to these changes, directly and through spillovers, in firms with looser constraints. Starting from these findings, we discuss the determinants of hours constraints, distinguishing between firms’ technologies and coordination of hours among coworkers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714827
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,The Impact of Ford Motor Company’s Voluntary Equal Wage Policy on Detroit’s Wage Gap in the 1940s,Jonathan A. Lanning and Curtis Reynolds,"We analyze the impact of Ford Motor Company’s compensation practices on the Detroit-area labor market from 1918 to 1947. Previous studies imply that Ford paid race-independent wages, but its Black workers were sorted into undesirable departments. We extend these results using propensity score reweighting of census data and Ford’s records and confirm that Ford paid equal wages. We then develop a search model with discriminatory and equal wage firms to assess the impact of Ford’s policy on the larger labor market. Calibrated simulations suggest that Ford may have reduced the wage gap in southeastern Michigan by as much as 50%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715118
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Firm Decisions and Variation across Universities in Access to High-Wage Jobs: Evidence from Employer Recruiting,Russell Weinstein,"I show that firm location decisions create barriers to accessing high-wage employers for students at distant universities. I collect office locations and campus recruiting strategies for more than 70 banking and consulting firms from 2000 to 2013. After firms open an office, students at nearby universities are nearly four times more likely to have on-campus access to the firm. Access increases for universities across a wide range of selectivity. Additional data from universities, LinkedIn, and mobility report cards suggest effects on hires and longer-run income success.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714367
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Demand Conditions and Worker Safety: Evidence from Price Shocks in Mining,"Kerwin Kofi Charles, Matthew S. Johnson, Melvin Stephens and Do Lee","We investigate how demand conditions affect employers’ provision of safety—something about which theory is ambivalent. Positive demand shocks relax financial constraints that limit safety investment but simultaneously raise the opportunity cost of increasing safety rather than production. We study the US metals mining sector, leveraging exogenous demand shocks from short-term variation in global commodity prices. We find that positive price shocks substantially increase workplace injury rates and safety regulation noncompliance. While these results indicate the general dominance of the opportunity cost effect, shocks that only increase mines’ cash flow lower injury rates, illustrating that financial constraints also affect safety.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713887
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,Motivating Employees through Career Paths,Heski Bar-Isaac and Raphaël Levy,"Firms have discretion over task allocations, which may dampen employees’ career prospects and, hence, their motivation. Task assignments and worker motivation interact through the extent of labor market competition—that is, the possibility of moving to another firm. More competition enhances motivation but decreases firms’ incentives to assign workers to informative tasks. One consequence is that competitive firms sometimes choose strategies that lead to intermediate competition. When the employee pool is heterogeneous, firms might choose different human resource practices that attract different kinds of workers and differentiate themselves through the career opportunities that they offer within and beyond the firm.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713759

More than 43% of white admits are ALDC; the share for African American, Asian American, and Hispanics is less than 16%. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three-quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected absent their ALDC status.

AA increases study effort and exam performance for the majority of disadvantaged students targeted by the policy.

Journal of Labor Economics,2022,How Widespread Are Social Network Effects? Evidence from the Early Twentieth-Century United States,Hui Ren Tan,"How widespread are social network effects? To answer this, I introduce a page-based approach for identifying individuals living in close proximity and compare how the propensity to work in the same industry varies among worker pairs residing in the same versus different areas. Across the 70 largest cities in the early twentieth-century United States, those from the same area are more likely to work in the same industry. On average, the increase in propensity is around 14%–20% of the baseline mean. These effects also tend to be stronger among single women and migrants from the same country of origin.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714518
Journal of Labor Economics,2022,"Does Remedial Education in Late Childhood Pay Off After All? Long-Run Consequences for University Schooling, Labor Market Outcomes, and Intergenerational Mobility","Victor Lavy, Assaf Kott and Genia Rachkovski","We analyze the long-term effects of a high school remedial education program almost two decades after its implementation. Treated students experienced an 11% increase in completed years of postsecondary schooling, a 4% increase in annual earnings, and a significant increase in intergenerational income mobility. These gains reflect improvement of students mainly from below-median-income families. We conclude that the program had gains beyond the short-term significant improvements in high school matriculation exams. A cost-benefit analysis of the program suggests that the government will recover its cost within 7–8 years, implying a very high rate of return.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713742
