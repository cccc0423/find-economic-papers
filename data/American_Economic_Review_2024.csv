American Economic Review,2024,Decisions under Risk Are Decisions under Complexity,Ryan Oprea,"We provide evidence that classic lottery anomalies like probability weighting and loss aversion are not special phenomena of risk. They also arise (and often with equal strength) when subjects evaluate deterministic, positive monetary payments that have been disaggregated to resemble lotteries. Thus, we find, e.g., apparent probability weighting in settings without probabilities and loss aversion in settings without scope for loss. Across subjects, anomalies in these deterministic tasks strongly predict the same anomalies in lotteries. These findings suggest that much of the behavior motivating our most important behavioral theories of risk derive from complexity-driven mistakes rather than true risk preferences.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221227
American Economic Review,2024,Curbing Leakage in Public Programs: Evidence from India's Direct Benefit Transfer Policy,Prabhat Barnwal,"Targeted price subsidies create a gap between subsidized and unsubsidized prices. The resulting dual pricing can lead to arbitrage opportunities where intermediaries divert subsidized goods to unintended beneficiaries via the black market. I study India's Direct Benefit Transfer policy for cooking fuel subsidies, which altered the existing subsidy program by transferring subsidies directly to beneficiaries' bank accounts. The policy decreased subsidized fuel purchases, indicating a reduction in diversion to the black market. Changes in unsubsidized fuel sales and black market prices provide supporting evidence that leakage was reduced. These results suggest that addressing the underlying perverse incentives in welfare delivery can improve efficiency by curbing leakages.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20161864
American Economic Review,2024,Aiming for the Goal: Contribution Dynamics of Crowdfunding,"Joyee Deb, Aniko Öry and Kevin R. Williams","We study a dynamic contribution game where investors seek private benefits offered in exchange for contributions, and a single, publicly minded donor values project success. We show that donor contributions serve as costly signals that encourage socially productive contributions by investors who face a coordination problem. Investors and the donor prefer different equilibria, but all benefit in expectation from the donor's ability to dynamically signal his valuation. We explore various contexts in which our model can be applied and delve empirically into the case of Kickstarter. We calibrate our model and quantify the coordination benefits of dynamic signaling in counterfactuals.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20181851
American Economic Review,2024,"Political Correctness, Social Image, and Information Transmission",Luca Braghieri,"A prominent argument in the political correctness debate is that people feel pressure to publicly espouse sociopolitical views they do not privately hold, and that such misrepresentations might render public discourse less vibrant and informative. This paper formalizes the argument in terms of social image and evaluates it experimentally in the context of college campuses. The results show that (i) social image concerns drive a wedge between the sensitive sociopolitical attitudes that college students report in private and in public; (ii) public utterances are indeed less informative than private utterances; and (iii) information loss is exacerbated by (partial) audience naïveté.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210039
American Economic Review,2024,"Loans for the ""Little Fellow"": Credit, Crisis, and Recovery in the Great Depression",Sarah Quincy,"This paper identifies how bank branching benefited local economies during the Great Depression. Using archival data and narrative evidence, I show how Bank of America's branch network in 1930s California created an internal capital market that diversified away local liquidity shortfalls, allowing the bank to maintain 49 percent higher credit growth from 1929 to 1933 than competing banks. The bank's presence mitigated cites' property value contractions and strengthened their recovery through 1940. Linked individual data show that the bank's proximity to workers hastened the transition from agricultural employment to human-capital–intensive sectors in the 1930s, generating structural change and higher wages.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211523
American Economic Review,2024,Beliefs in Repeated Games: An Experiment,"Masaki Aoyagi, Guillaume R. Fréchette and Sevgi Yuksel","This paper uses a laboratory experiment to study beliefs and their relationship to action and strategy choices in finitely and indefinitely repeated prisoners' dilemma games. We find subjects' elicited beliefs about the other player's action are generally accurate despite some systematic deviations, and anticipate the evolution of behavior differently between the finite and indefinite games. We also use the elicited beliefs over actions to recover beliefs over supergame strategies played by the other player. We find these beliefs over strategies correctly capture the different classes of strategies played in each game, vary substantially across subjects, and rationalize their strategies.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220639
American Economic Review,2024,The Real State: Inside the Congo's Traffic Police Agency,"Raúl Sánchez  de la Sierra, Kristof Titeca, Haoyang (Stan) Xie, Aimable Amani Lameke and Albert Jolino Malukisa","This paper provides insight into a corruption scheme in Kinshasa's traffic police agency. First, various data collection branches show that the agency's revenue is five times that from fines and is derived from a coalition of traffic police officials, their managers, and judicial police officers scheming to extort drivers. Second, the analysis of an experiment suggests that the scheme subverts service. Third, the scheme appears to be a rational response to the context, but its logic is widespread. The findings suggest that coalitions of officials, while being socially costly, can yield large illicit revenue, nuancing the notion of state weakness.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220908
American Economic Review,2024,Contamination Bias in Linear Regressions,"Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, Peter Hull and Michal Kolesár","We study regressions with multiple treatments and a set of controls that is flexible enough to purge omitted variable bias. We show these regressions generally fail to estimate convex averages of heterogeneous treatment effects—instead, estimates of each treatment's effect are contaminated by nonconvex averages of the effects of other treatments. We discuss three estimation approaches that avoid such contamination bias, including the targeting of easiest-to-estimate weighted average effects. A reanalysis of nine empirical applications finds economically and statistically meaningful contamination bias in observational studies; contamination bias in experimental studies is more limited due to smaller variability in propensity scores.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221116
American Economic Review,2024,Measuring Science: Performance Metrics and the Allocation of Talent,"Sebastian Hager, Carlo Schwarz and Fabian Waldinger","We study how performance metrics affect the allocation of talent by exploiting the introduction of the first citation database in science. For technical reasons, it only covered citations from certain journals and years, creating quasi-random variation: some citations became visible, while others remained invisible. We identify the effects of citation metrics by comparing the predictiveness of visible to invisible citations. Citation metrics increased assortative matching between scientists and departments by reducing information frictions over geographic and intellectual distance. Highly cited scientists from lower-ranked departments (""hidden stars"") and from minorities benefited more. Citation metrics also affected promotions and NSF grants, suggesting Matthew effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230515
American Economic Review,2024,Bias and Sensitivity under Ambiguity,"Zhen Huo, Marcelo Pedroni and Guangyu Pei","This paper characterizes the effects of ambiguity aversion under dispersed information. The equilibrium outcome is observationally equivalent to a Bayesian forecast of the fundamental with increased sensitivity to signals and a pessimistic bias. This equivalence result takes a simple form that accommodates dynamic information and strategic interactions. Applying the result, we show that ambiguity aversion helps rationalize the joint empirical pattern between the bias and persistence of inflation forecasts conditional on household income. In a policy game à la Barro and Gordon (1983) with ambiguity-averse agents, the policy rule features higher average inflation and increased responsiveness to fundamentals.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20231012
American Economic Review,2024,Polity Size and Local Government Performance: Evidence from India,Veda Narasimhan and Jeffrey Weaver,"Developing countries have increasingly decentralized power to local governments. This paper studies the implications of a central element of decentralization (polity size) using population-based discontinuities that determine local government boundaries for over 100,000 Indian villages. Over the short and long run, individuals allocated into local governments with smaller populations have better access to public goods. We provide suggestive evidence that these results are related to heightened civic engagement and stronger political incentives, but not to other mechanisms such as elite capture.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221712
American Economic Review,2024,Institution Building without Commitment,"Marco Bassetto, Zhen Huo and José-Víctor Ríos-Rull","We propose a theory of gradualism in the implementation of good policies, suitable for environments featuring time consistency. We downplay the role of the initial period by allowing agents both to wait for future agents to start equilibrium play and to restart the equilibrium by ignoring past history. The allocation gradually transits toward one that weighs both short- and long-term concerns, stopping short of the Ramsey outcome but greatly improving upon Markovian equilibria. We use the theory to account for the slow emergence of both climate policies and the reduction of global tariff rates.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20201365
American Economic Review,2024,Financial Technology Adoption: Network Externalities of Cashless Payments in Mexico,Sean Higgins,"Do coordination failures constrain financial technology adoption? Exploiting the Mexican government's rollout of 1 million debit cards to poor households from 2009 to 2012, I examine responses on both sides of the market and find important spillovers and distributional impacts. On the supply side, small retail firms adopted point-of-sale terminals to accept card payments. On the demand side, this led to a 21 percent increase in other consumers' card adoption. The supply-side technology adoption response had positive effects on both richer consumers and small retail firms: richer consumers shifted 13 percent of their supermarket consumption to small retailers, whose sales and profits increased.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20201952
American Economic Review,2024,"Sticky Spending, Sequestration, and Government Debt",Facundo Piguillem and Alessandro Riboni,"Once established, government spending programs tend to continue. A commonly held view is that spending inertia leads to unsustainable debt, ultimately requiring fiscal adjustments such as ""sequestration."" We show that by insuring against political turnover, inertia may reduce politicians' incentives to accumulate debt. However, large preexisting commitments and the prospect of future stabilization can lead to overspending to dilute past administrations' commitments. Finally, we show that political polarization amplifies incentives to prioritize inertial programs, potentially explaining the increased share of mandatory spending in the US budget.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210935
American Economic Review,2024,Generalized Social Marginal Welfare Weights Imply Inconsistent Comparisons of Tax Policies,Itai Sher,"This paper concerns Saez and Stantcheva's (2016) generalized social marginal welfare weights, which aggregate losses and gains due to tax policies while incorporating nonutilitarian ethical considerations. The approach evaluates local tax changes without a global social objective. I show that local tax policy comparisons implicitly entail global comparisons. Moreover, whenever welfare weights do not have a utilitarian structure, these implied global comparisons are inconsistent. I argue that broader ethical values cannot in general be represented simply by modifying the weights placed on benefits to different people, and a more thoroughgoing modification of the utilitarian approach is required.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211025
American Economic Review,2024,The Dynamic Consequences of State Building: Evidence from the French Revolution,"Cédric Chambru, Emeric Henry and Benjamin Marx","How do radical reforms shape economic development over time? In 1790, the French Constituent Assembly overhauled the kingdom's organization to establish new local capitals. In some departments, the choice of local capitals over rival candidate cities was plausibly exogenous. We study how changes in administrative presence affect state capacity and development in the ensuing decades. In the short run, administrative proximity increases taxation and investments in law enforcement. In the long run, capitals obtain more public goods and grow faster. Our results shed light on the dynamic impacts of state building following one of history's most ambitious administrative reforms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220110
American Economic Review,2024,Merchants of Death: The Effect of Credit Supply Shocks on Hospital Outcomes,"Cyrus Aghamolla, Pinar Karaca-Mandic, Xuelin Li and Richard T. Thakor","This study examines the link between credit supply and hospital health outcomes. We use bank stress tests as exogenous shocks to credit access for hospitals that have lending relationships with tested banks. We find that affected hospitals shift their operations to increase resource utilization following a negative credit shock but reduce the quality of their care to patients across a variety of measures, including a significant increase in risk-adjusted readmission and mortality rates. The results indicate that access to credit can affect the quality of health care hospitals deliver, pointing to important spillover effects of credit market frictions on health outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221705
American Economic Review,2024,Micro Risks and (Robust) Pareto-Improving Policies,"Mark Aguiar, Manuel Amador and Cristina Arellano",We provide conditions for the feasibility of robust Pareto-improving (RPI) policies when markets are incomplete and the interest rate is below the growth rate. We allow for arbitrary heterogeneity in preferences and income risk and a wedge between the return to capital and bonds. An RPI improves risk sharing and can induce a more efficient level of capital. Elasticities of aggregate savings to changes in interest rates are the crucial ingredients to the feasibility of RPIs. Government debt may complement rather than substitute for capital in an RPI. Our analysis emphasizes the welfare-improving qualities of government bonds versus explicit redistribution.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230128
American Economic Review,2024,A Technology-Gap Model of 'Premature' Deindustrialization,Ippei Fujiwara and Kiminori Matsuyama,"We propose a parsimonious mechanism for generating premature deindustrialization (PD). In the baseline model, the Baumol effect drives the hump-shaped path of the manufacturing share. Countries follow different paths due to the difference in the sector-specific adoption lags. The condition for PD under which countries differ only in technology gap implies that the cross-country productivity dispersion is the largest in agriculture. Moreover, when calibrated to match Rodrik's (2016) findings, it is the smallest in manufacturing. In three extensions, we add the Engel effect, international trade, and catching up by late industrializers, to demonstrate the robustness of the mechanism.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230133
American Economic Review,2024,Quality Is in the Eye of the Beholder: Taste Projection in Markets with Observational Learning,Tristan Gagnon-Bartsch and Antonio Rosato,"We study how misperceptions of others' tastes influence beliefs, demand, and prices in markets with observational learning. Consumers infer a good's quality from the quantity demanded and price paid by others. When consumers exaggerate the similarity between their and others' tastes, such ""taste projection"" generates discrepant quality perceptions, which are decreasing in a projector's taste and increasing in the observed price. These biased inferences produce an excessively elastic market demand. We also analyze dynamic monopoly pricing with short-lived taste-projecting consumers. Optimal pricing follows a declining path: a high initial price inflates future buyers' perceptions, and lower subsequent prices induce overadoption.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230814
American Economic Review,2024,The Social Costs of Keystone Species Collapse: Evidence from the Decline of Vultures in India,Eyal Frank and Anant Sudarshan,"Scientific evidence has documented we are undergoing a mass extinction of species, caused by human activity. However, allocating conservation resources is difficult due to scarce evidence on damages from losing individual species. This paper studies the collapse of vultures in India, triggered by the expiry of a patent on a painkiller. Our results suggest the functional extinction of vultures—efficient scavengers that removed carcasses from the environment—increased human mortality by over 4 percent because of a large negative shock to sanitation. We quantify damages at $69.4 billion per year. These results suggest high returns to conserving keystone species such as vultures.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230016
American Economic Review,2024,Public Discourse and Socially Responsible Market Behavior,"Björn Bartling, Vanessa Valero, Roberto A. Weber and Lan Yao","We investigate the causal impact of public discourse on socially responsible market behavior. Across three laboratory experiments, having market participants engage in public discourse generally increases market social responsibility. These positive impacts are robust to variation in several characteristics of the discourse. We provide evidence that discourse strengthens beliefs that others support socially responsible exchange. However, relaxing requirements to engage in discourse sharply reduces its effectiveness. Our findings suggest that campaigns encouraging discussion of appropriate market behavior can have sizable impacts on addressing inefficiencies due to market failures but that policies encouraging broad public engagement may be important.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20201361
American Economic Review,2024,Optimally Imprecise Memory and Biased Forecasts,"Rava Azeredo da Silveira, Yeji Sung and Michael Woodford",We propose a model of optimal decision-making subject to a memory constraint in the spirit of models of rational inattention. Our theory differs from that of Sims (2003) in not assuming costless memory of past cognitive states. The model implies that both forecasts and actions will exhibit idiosyncratic random variation; that average beliefs will exhibit a bias that fluctuates forever; and that more recent news will be given disproportionate weight in forecasts. The model provides a simple explanation for the overreaction to news observed in the laboratory by Afrouzi et al. (2023).,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20201806
American Economic Review,2024,Monitoring in Small Firms: Experimental Evidence from Kenyan Public Transit,"Erin M. Kelley, Gregory Lane and David Schönholzer",Small firms struggle to grow beyond a few employees. We introduce monitoring devices into commuter minibuses in Kenya and randomize which minibus owners have access to the data using a novel mobile app. We find that treated vehicle owners modify the terms of the contract to induce higher effort and lower risk taking from their drivers. This reduces firm costs and increases firm profitability. There is suggestive evidence that some firms expand. These results suggest that small firms may be able to utilize monitoring technologies to overcome problems of moral hazard and enhance their profitability.,https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210987
American Economic Review,2024,Efficiency and Equity Impacts of Urban Transportation Policies with Equilibrium Sorting,"Panle Barwick, Shanjun Li, Andrew Waxman, Jing Wu and Tianli Xia","We estimate an equilibrium sorting model of housing location and commuting mode choice with endogenous traffic congestion to evaluate urban transportation policies. Leveraging fine-scale data from travel diaries and housing transactions identifying residents' home and work locations, we recover rich preference heterogeneity over both travel mode and residential location decisions. While different policies produce the same congestion reduction, their impacts on social welfare differ drastically. In addition, sorting undermines the congestion reduction under driving restrictions and subway expansion but strengthens it under congestion pricing. The combination of congestion pricing and subway expansion delivers the greatest congestion relief and efficiency gains.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220212

We characterize optimal smooth tax systems on income and savings (or other commodities), as well as simpler tax systems. We use familiar elasticity concepts and a novel sufficient statistic for heterogeneity correlated with earnings ability: the difference between across-income variation in savings and the causal effect of income on savings. We apply these formulas to the United States and find that the optimal savings tax is mostly positive and progressive.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221053

American Economic Review,2024,Dynamic Outside Options and Optimal Negotiation Strategies,Andrew McClellan,"We study the design of negotiation strategies when a principal and agent must decide how to split a pie while the agent's outside option changes over time. The principal's optimal strategy under commitment demonstrates a new, but intuitive, set of negotiation dynamics. When the agent is tempted to leave, the principal gradually promises a larger share (decreasing demands) and more time to explore the outside option (decreasing pressure), illustrating a complementarity between these two tools. Although the principal's expected utility is decreasing in the outside option, his expected utility and demands are increasing in the outside option's drift and volatility.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230015
American Economic Review,2024,The Price of Power: Costs of Political Corruption in Indian Electricity,Meera Mahadevan,"Politicians may target public goods to benefit their constituents, at the expense of others.

Using new administrative billing data and close-election regression discontinuities, I show that billed electricity consumption is lower for constituencies of the winning party by almost 40 percent, while actual consumption, measured by nighttime lights, is higher. I document the covert way in which politicians subsidize constituents by manipulating bills. These actions have substantial welfare implications, with an efficiency loss of US$0.9 billion, leading to unreliable electricity supply and significant negative consequences for development.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230248
American Economic Review,2024,Women Left Behind: Gender Disparities in Utilization of Government Health Insurance in India,Pascaline Dupas and Radhika Jain,"We document large gender disparities within a government program that entitles 46 million poor individuals to free hospital care. We show that care is not free in practice and higher costs are associated with larger disparities. Lowering care costs increases female utilization but does not reduce gender disparities because marginal beneficiaries are as likely to be male as inframarginals. Long-term exposure to local female leaders reduces disparities by addressing factors lowering female care. In the presence of gender bias, subsidizing social services may fail to address gender inequalities without actions that specifically target females.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230521
American Economic Review,2024,Arbitraging Covered Interest Rate Parity Deviations and Bank Lending,Lorena Keller,"I propose and test a new channel through which covered interest rate parity (CIP) deviations can affect bank lending in emerging economies. I argue that when CIP deviations exist, banks attempt to arbitrage them. To do so, banks must borrow in a particular currency. When this currency is scarce, bank lending in the currency required to arbitrage decreases, while they use this currency in their arbitrage activities. I test this channel by exploiting differences in the abilities of Peruvian banks to arbitrage CIP deviations. I find evidence that supports the proposed channel.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230425

Researchers often instead assume people narrowly bracket, but existing designs do not test it. We design a novel experiment and revealed preference tests for how someone brackets their choices. In portfolio allocation under risk, social allocation, and induced-value shopping experiments, 40–43 percent of subjects are consistent with narrow bracketing, and 0–16 percent with broad bracketing. Adjusting for each model's predictive precision, 74 percent of subjects are best described by narrow bracketing, 13 percent by broad bracketing, and 6 percent by intermediate cases.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210877

Relative to properties that have been promised an extension protection, those with unprotected leases granted by the current government are sold at a discount of 8 percent; those with colonial leases suffer an additional discount of 8 percent. Incorporating estimated structural parameters that suggest an additional 20 percent ground rent after 2047, our model matches empirical discounts well across lease horizons.

Motivated by ethnographic accounts suggesting that this distinction affects redistribution, we analyze a cash transfer program in Kenya and find that in age-based societies there are consumption spillovers within the age cohort, but not the extended family, while in kin-based societies we find the opposite. Next, we document that social structure shapes the impact of policy by showing that Uganda's pension program had positive effects on child nutrition only in kin-based societies.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211856

To examine this trade-off, we exploit experimental variation in short-run microenterprise growth among a sample of Indian households and track schooling and business out-comes over eleven years. Treated households, who experience higher initial microenterprise growth, are on average one-third more likely to send children to college. However, educational investment and schooling gains are concentrated among literate-parent households, whose enterprises eventually stagnate. In contrast, illiterate-parent households experience long-run business gains but declines in children's education.

Larger loans generate small average impacts, but machine learning using psychometric data reveals ""top performers"" (those with the highest predicted treatment effects) substantially increase profits, while profits drop for poor performers. The large differences imply that lender credit allocation decisions matter for aggregate income, yet we find existing practice leads to substantial misallocation. We argue that some entrepreneurs are overoptimistic and squander the opportunities presented by larger loans by taking on too much risk, and show the promise of allocations based on entrepreneurial type relative to firm characteristics.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220616

Using calorie shortfalls as a proxy for marginal utility, we find that this condition holds for low-income Indian households. Expansions in India's flagship in-kind food transfer program not only increase caloric intake but also reduce caloric sensitivity to prices.

American Economic Review,2024,Spending and Job-Finding Impacts of Expanded Unemployment Benefits: Evidence from Administrative Micro Data,"Peter Ganong, Fiona Greig, Pascal Noel, Daniel M. Sullivan and Joseph Vavra","We show that the largest increase in unemployment benefits in US history had large spending impacts and small job-finding impacts. This finding has three implications. First, increased benefits were important for explaining aggregate spending dynamics—but not employment dynamics—during the pandemic. Second, benefit expansions allow us to study the MPC of normally low-liquidity households in a high-liquidity state. These households still have high MPCs. This suggests a role for permanent behavioral characteristics, rather than just current liquidity, in driving spending behavior. Third, the mechanisms driving our results imply that temporary benefit supplements are a promising countercyclical tool.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220973

This comparison is equivalent to reveal-or-refine: every realization of the more valuable signal reveals the state or refines the realization of the less valuable signal. We also study other comparisons of signals, including sufficiency, martingale dominance, and Lehmann.

Access to finance had a positive direct effect on business quality and consumer satisfaction and a negative effect on price, which were not offset by indirect effects, implying net gains in consumer surplus. We document other indirect effects and combine effects in a welfare evaluation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220711
American Economic Review,2024,Strengthening State Capacity: Civil Service Reform and Public Sector Performance during the Gilded Age,Abhay Aneja and Guo Xu,"We use newly digitized records from the post office to study the effects of strengthened state capacity between 1875 and 1901. Exploiting the implementation of the Pendleton Act—a landmark statute that shielded bureaucrats from political interference—across US cities over two waves, we find that civil service reform reduced postal delivery errors and increased productivity. These improvements were most pronounced during election years when the reform dampened bureaucratic turnover. We provide suggestive evidence that reformed cities witnessed declining local partisan newspapers. Separating politics from administration, therefore, not only improved state effectiveness but also weakened the role of local politics.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230019
American Economic Review,2024,Repeated Trading: Transparency and Market Structure,Ayça Kaya and Santanu Roy,"We analyze the effect of transparency of past trading volumes in markets where an informed long-lived seller can repeatedly trade with short-lived uninformed buyers. Transparency allows buyers to observe previously sold quantities. In markets with intraperiod monopsony (single buyer each period), transparency reduces welfare if the ex ante expected quality is low but improves welfare if the expected quality is high. The effect is reversed in markets with intraperiod competition (multiple buyers each period). This discrepancy in the efficiency implications of transparency is explained by how buyer competition affects the seller's ability to capture rents, which, in turn, influences market screening.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230114

We characterize the optimal mechanism: trade occurs if and only if the buyer's benefit of trade exceeds a weighted average of sellers' virtual costs.

It originates from a slowdown in labor supply growth since the late 1970s, largely predetermined by demographics. This channel can explain roughly half of the decline and why incumbent firm survival and average growth over the life cycle have changed little. We show these results in a standard model of firm dynamics and test the mechanism using cross-state variation in labor supply growth. Finally, we show that a longer entry rate series imputed using historical establishment tabulations rises over the 1960s–1970s period of accelerating labor force growth.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210362

We find that risk-averse college-goers are not willing to accept these terms, so markets unravel.

The effects are concentrated in Mafia-dominated sectors and in municipalities where fewer incumbents are reelected.

American Economic Review,2024,The Opportunity Cost of Debt Aversion,Alejandro Martínez-Marquina and Mike Shi,"We provide evidence of the existence of debt aversion and its negative implications for financial decisions. In a new experimental design where subjects are assigned debt randomly, we quantify the opportunity cost of subjects' debt-biased decisions. One-third of our participants neglect high returns and focus instead on debt repayments. In addition, borrowing to invest is 50 percent less likely when it leads to indebtedness. On average, participants perceive $1 less in debt as equivalent to $1.03 in savings. Hence, a debt-averse agent will undertake a 10 percent guaranteed investment only if the cost of borrowing does not exceed 6.80 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221509
American Economic Review,2024,Nurturing Childhood Curiosity to Enhance Learning: Evidence from a Randomized Pedagogical Intervention,Sule Alan and Ipek Mumcu,"We evaluate a pedagogical intervention aimed at improving learning in elementary school children by fostering their curiosity. We test the effectiveness of the pedagogy using achievement scores and a novel measure of curiosity. The latter involves creating a sense of information deprivation and quantifying the urge to acquire information and retention ability. The intervention increases curiosity, knowledge retention, and science test scores, with the effects persisting into middle school years. It also leads to more information sharing and peer learning in the classroom. The evidence can help design better pedagogical tools to increase pupil engagement and the quality of learning.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20230084
American Economic Review,2024,The Economics of the Public Option: Evidence from Local Pharmaceutical Markets,"Juan Pablo Atal, José Ignacio Cuesta, Felipe González and Cristóbal Otero","We study the effects of competition by state-owned firms, leveraging the decentralized entry of public pharmacies to local markets in Chile. Public pharmacies sell the same drugs at a third of private pharmacy prices, because of stronger upstream bargaining and market power in the private sector, but are of lower quality. Public pharmacies induced market segmentation and price increases in the private sector, which benefited the switchers to the public option but harmed the stayers. The countrywide entry of public pharmacies would reduce yearly consumer drug expenditure by 1.6 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211547
American Economic Review,2024,The Effect of Macroeconomic Uncertainty on Household Spending,"Olivier Coibion, Dimitris Georgarakos, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Geoff Kenny and Michael Weber","We use randomized treatments that provide different types of information about the first and/or second moments of future economic growth to generate exogenous changes in the perceived macroeconomic uncertainty of treated households. The effects on their spending decisions relative to an untreated control group are measured in follow-up surveys. Our results indicate that, after taking into account first moments, higher macroeconomic uncertainty induces households to significantly and persistently reduce their total monthly spending in subsequent months. Changes in spending are broad based across spending categories and apply to larger durable good purchases as well.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221167
American Economic Review,2024,Optimal Inference for Spot Regressions,"Tim Bollerslev, Jia Li and Yuexuan Ren","Betas from return regressions are commonly used to measure systematic financial market risks. ""Good"" beta measurements are essential for a range of empirical inquiries in finance and macroeconomics. We introduce a novel econometric framework for the nonparametric estimation of time-varying betas with high-frequency data. The ""local Gaussian"" property of the generic continuous-time benchmark model enables optimal ""finite-sample"" inference in a well-defined sense. It also affords more reliable inference in empirically realistic settings compared to conventional large-sample approaches. Two applications pertaining to the tracking performance of leveraged ETFs and an intraday event study illustrate the practical usefulness of the new procedures.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221338
American Economic Review,2024,The Comparative Statics of Sorting,Axel Anderson and Lones Smith,"We create a general and tractable theory of increasing sorting in pairwise matching models with monetary transfers. The positive quadrant dependence partial order subsumes Becker (1973) as the extreme cases with most and least sorting and implies increasing regression coefficients. Our theory turns on synergy—the cross-partial difference or derivative of match production. This reflects basic economic forces: diminishing returns, technological convexity, insurance, and learning dynamics. We prove sorting increases if match synergy globally increases, and is cross-sectionally monotone or single crossing. We use our results to derive sorting predictions in major economics sorting papers and in new applications.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210890
American Economic Review,2024,Mental Models and Learning: The Case of Base-Rate Neglect,"Ignacio Esponda, Emanuel Vespa and Sevgi Yuksel","We experimentally document persistence of suboptimal behavior despite ample opportunities to learn from feedback in a canonical updating problem where people suffer from base-rate neglect. Our results provide insights on the mechanisms hindering learning from feedback. Importantly, our results suggest mistakes are more likely to be persistent when they are driven by incorrect mental models that miss or misrepresent important aspects of the environment. Such models induce confidence in initial answers, limiting engagement with and learning from feedback. We substantiate these insights in an alternative scenario where individuals involved in a voting problem overlook the importance of being pivotal.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20201004
American Economic Review,2024,Hub-and-Spoke Cartels: Theory and Evidence from the Grocery Industry,"Robert Clark, Ig Horstmann and Jean-François Houde","Numerous recently uncovered cartels operated along the supply chain, with firms at one end facilitating collusion at the other—hub-and-spoke arrangements. These cartels are hard to rationalize because they induce double marginalization and higher costs. We examine Canada's alleged bread cartel and provide the first comprehensive analysis of hub-and-spoke collusion. Using court documents and pricing data, we make three contributions: (i) we show that collusion was effective, increasing inflation by about 50 percent; (ii) we provide evidence that collusion existed at both ends of the supply chain; and (iii) we develop a model explaining why this form of collusion arose.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20211337

Buntaine, Michael Greenstone, Guojun He, Mengdi Liu, Shaoda Wang and Bing Zhang","We conducted a nationwide field experiment in China to evaluate the direct and indirect impacts of assigning firms to public or private citizen appeals when they violate pollution standards. There are three main findings. First, public appeals to the regulator through social media substantially reduce violations and pollution emissions, while private appeals cause more modest environmental improvements. Second, public appeals appear to tilt regulators' focus away from facilitating economic growth and toward avoiding pollution-induced public unrest. Third, pollution reductions by treated firms are not offset by control firms, based on randomly varying the proportion of treated firms at the prefecture level.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221215
American Economic Review,2024,The Gender Gap in Confidence: Expected but Not Accounted For,Christine L. Exley and Kirby Nielsen,"We investigate how the gender gap in confidence affects the views that evaluators (e.g., employers) hold about men and women. We find the confidence gap is contagious, causing evaluators to form overly pessimistic beliefs about women. This result arises even though the confidence gap is expected and even though the confidence gap shouldn't be contagious if evaluators are Bayesian. Only an intervention that facilitates Bayesian updating proves (somewhat) effective. Additional results highlight how similar findings follow even when there is no room for discriminatory motives or differences in priors because evaluators are asked about arbitrary, rather than gender-specific, groups.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221413
American Economic Review,2024,Distinguishing Common Ratio Preferences from Common Ratio Effects Using Paired Valuation Tasks,"Christina McGranaghan, Kirby Nielsen, Ted O'Donoghue, Jason Somerville and Charles D. Sprenger","Without strong assumptions about how noise manifests in choices, we can infer little from existing empirical observations of the common ratio effect (CRE) about whether there exists an underlying common ratio preference (CRP). We propose to solve this inferential challenge using paired valuations, which yield valid inference under common assumptions. Using this approach in an online experiment with 900 participants, we find no evidence of a systematic CRP. To reconcile our findings with existing evidence, we present the same participants with paired choice tasks and demonstrate how noise can generate a CRE even for individuals without an associated CRP.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221535
American Economic Review,2024,The Immigrant Next Door,"Leonardo Bursztyn, Thomas Chaney, Tarek Hassan and Aakaash Rao","We study how decades-long exposure to individuals of a give foreign descent shapes natives' attitudes and behavior toward that group. Using individualized donations data, we show that long-term exposure to a given foreign ancestry leads to more generous behavior specifically toward that group's ancestral country. Focusing on exposure to Arab Muslims to examine mechanisms, we show that long-term exposure (i) decreases explicit and implicit prejudice against Arab Muslims, (ii) reduces support for policies and political candidates hostile toward Arab Muslims, (iii) increases charitable donations to Arab countries, (iv) leads to more personal contact with Arab Muslims, and (v) increases knowledge of Arab Muslims and Islam.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220376
American Economic Review,2024,The Nurture of Nature and the Nature of Nurture: How Genes and Investments Interact in the Formation of Skills,"Mikkel Aagaard Houmark, Victor Ronda and Michael Rosholm","This paper studies the interplay between genetics and family investments in the process of skill formation. We model and estimate the joint evolution of skills and parental investments throughout early childhood. We document three genetic mechanisms: the direct effect of child genes on skills, the indirect effect of child genes via parental investments, and family genetic influences captured by parental genes. We show that genetic effects are dynamic, increase over time, and operate via environmental channels. Our paper highlights the value of integrating biological and social perspectives into a single unified framework.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220456
American Economic Review,2024,Prolonged Learning and Hasty Stopping: The Wald Problem with Ambiguity,"Sarah Auster, Yeon-Koo Che and Konrad Mierendorff","This paper studies sequential information acquisition by an ambiguity-averse decision-maker (DM), who decides how long to collect information before taking an irreversible action. The agent optimizes against the worst-case belief and updates prior by prior. We show that the consideration of ambiguity gives rise to rich dynamics: compared to the Bayesian DM, the DM here tends to experiment excessively when facing modest uncertainty and, to counteract it, may stop experimenting prematurely when facing high uncertainty. In the latter case, the DM's stopping rule is nonmonotonic in beliefs and features randomized stopping.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221149
American Economic Review,2024,Gender Differences in Medical Evaluations: Evidence from Randomly Assigned Doctors,Marika Cabral and Marcus Dillender,"Little is known about what drives gender disparities in health care and related social insurance benefits. Using data and variation from the Texas workers' compensation program, we study the impact of gender match between doctors and patients on medical evaluations and associated disability benefits. Compared to differences among their male patient counterparts, female patients randomly assigned a female doctor rather than a male doctor are 5.2 percent more likely to be evaluated as disabled and receive 8.6 percent more subsequent cash benefits on average. There is no analogous gender-match effect for male patients. Our estimates indicate that increasing the share of female patients evaluated by female doctors may substantially shrink gender gaps in medical evaluations and associated outcomes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220349

We generalize and extend this theoretical result and test it using data from television and social media advertising. We find that the model is a good match, qualitatively and quantitatively, to variation in advertising prices across demographic groups, outlets, platforms, and over time. We use the model to quantify the effects of competition within and across platforms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220943
American Economic Review,2024,Asset-Based Microfinance for Microenterprises: Evidence from Pakistan,"Faisal Bari, Kashif Malik, Muhammad Meki and Simon Quinn","We run a field experiment offering graduated microcredit clients the opportunity to finance a business asset worth four times their usual borrowing limit. We implement this using a hire-purchase contract; our control group is offered a zero interest loan at the usual borrowing limit. We find large, significant, and persistent effects: treated microenterprise owners run larger businesses with higher profits; consequently, household consumption increases, particularly on food and children's education. A dynamic structural model with nonconvex capital adjustment costs rationalizes our results and allows counterfactual analysis; this highlights the potential for welfare improvements through large capital injections that are financially sustainable.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20210169
American Economic Review,2024,"Old Age Risks, Consumption, and Insurance","Richard Blundell, Margherita Borella, Jeanne Commault and Mariacristina De Nardi","In the United States, after age 65, households face income and health risks, and a large fraction of these risks are transitory. While consumption significantly responds to transitory income shocks, out-of-pocket medical expenses do not. In contrast, both consumption and out-of-pocket medical expenses respond to transitory health shocks. Thus, most US elderly keep their out-of-pocket medical expenses close to a satiation point that varies with health. Consumption responds to health shocks mostly because adverse health shocks reduce the marginal utility of consumption. The effect of health on marginal utility changes the optimal transfers due to health shocks.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220555
American Economic Review,2024,Disentangling Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection,"Henrique Castro-Pires, Hector Chade and Jeroen Swinkels","While many real-world principal-agent problems have both moral hazard and adverse selection, existing tools largely analyze only one at a time. Do the insights from the separate analyses survive when the frictions are combined? We develop a simple method—decoupling—to study both problems at once. When decoupling works, everything we know from the separate analyses carries over, but interesting interactions also arise. We provide simple tests for whether decoupling is valid. We develop and numerically implement an algorithm to calculate the decoupled solution and check its validity. We also provide primitives for decoupling to work and analyze several extensions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220100
American Economic Review,2024,Universal Basic Income: A Dynamic Assessment,Diego Daruich and Raquel Fernández,"Universal basic income (UBI) is an increasingly popular policy proposal, but there is no evidence regarding its longer-term consequences. We find that UBI generates large welfare losses in a general equilibrium model with imperfect capital markets, labor market shocks, and intergenerational linkages via skill formation and transfers. This conclusion is robust to various alternative ways of financing UBI. By using observationally equivalent models that eliminate different sources of endogenous dynamic linkages (equilibrium capital market and parental investment in child skills), we show that the latter are largely responsible for the negative welfare consequences.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221099
American Economic Review,2024,Retirement Consumption and Pension Design,"Jonas Kolsrud, Camille Landais, Daniel Reck and Johannes Spinnewijn","This paper analyzes consumption to evaluate the distributional effects of pension reforms. Using Swedish administrative data, we show that on average, workers who retire earlier consume less while retired and experience larger drops in consumption around retirement. Interpreted via a theoretical model, these findings imply that reforms incentivizing later retirement incur a substantial consumption smoothing cost. Turning to other features of pension policy, we find that reforms that redistribute based on early-career labor supply would have opposite-signed redistributive effects, while differentiating on wealth may help to target pension benefits toward those who are vulnerable to larger drops in consumption around retirement.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221426
American Economic Review,2024,The Ends of 27 Big Depressions,"Martin Ellison, Sang Seok Lee and Kevin O'Rourke","How did countries recover from the Great Depression? In this paper, we explore the argument that leaving the gold standard helped by boosting inflationary expectations, lowering real interest rates, and stimulating interest-sensitive expenditures. We do so for a sample of 27 countries, using modern nowcasting methods and a new dataset containing more than 230,000 monthly and quarterly observations for over 1,500 variables. In those cases where the departure from gold happened on well-defined dates, inflationary expectations clearly rose in the wake of departure. Instrumental variable, difference-in-difference, and synthetic matching techniques suggest that the relationship is causal.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221479

We cross-randomize pharmacotherapy and livelihoods assistance among 1,000 depressed adults and evaluate impacts on depression severity, socioeconomic outcomes, and several potential pathways. When combined, the interventions reduce depression severity, with benefits that persist after treatment concludes. Pharmacotherapy alone has a weaker effect that is only marginally significant and dissipates sooner.

American Economic Review,2024,Market Power and Innovation in the Intangible Economy,Maarten De Ridder,"This paper offers a unified explanation for the slowdown of productivity growth, the decline in business dynamism, and the rise of market power. Using a quantitative framework, I show that the rise of intangible inputs, such as software, can explain these trends. Intangibles reduce marginal costs and raise fixed costs, which gives firms with high-intangible adoption a competitive advantage, in turn deterring other firms from entering. I structurally estimate the model on French and US micro data. After initially boosting productivity, the rise of intangibles causes a decline in productivity growth, consistent with the empirical trends observed since the mid-1990s.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20201079

These linkages may propagate or attenuate shocks. Using panel data from Thai villages, we document three facts: as households facing idiosyncratic shocks adjust their production, these shocks propagate to other households on both the production and consumption sides; propagation is greater via labor than supply chain links; and shocks in denser networks and to more central households propagate more, while access to formal or informal insurance reduces propagation. Social benefits from expanding safety nets may be higher than private benefits.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20220892
American Economic Review,2024,Competing to Commit: Markets with Rational Inattention,"Carlo Cusumano, Francesco Fabbri and Ferdinand Pieroth","Two homogeneous-good firms compete for a consumer's unitary demand. The consumer is rationally inattentive and pays entropy costs to process information about firms' offers. Compared to a collusion benchmark, competition produces two effects. As in standard models, competition puts downward pressure on prices. But, additionally, an attention effect arises: the consumer engages in trade more often. This alleviates the commitment problem that firms have when facing inattentive consumers and increases trade efficiency. For high enough attention costs, the attention effect dominates the effect on prices: firms' profits are higher under competition than under collusion.",https://www.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.20221605
