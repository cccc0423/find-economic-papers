The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,Manufacturing Revolutions: Industrial Policy and Industrialization in South Korea*,Nathan Lane,"I study the effect of industrial policies on industrial development by considering an important episode during the East Asian miracle: South Korea’s heavy and chemical industry (HCI) drive, 1973–1979. Based on newly assembled data, I use the introduction and termination of industrial policies to study their effects during and after the intervention period. I reveal that HCI policies promoted the expansion and dynamic comparative advantage of directly targeted industries. Using variation in exposure to policies through the input-output network, I demonstrate that the policy indirectly benefited downstream users of targeted intermediates. The benefits of HCI persisted even after the policy ended, and some results took time to materialize. The findings suggest that the temporary drive shifted Korean manufacturing into more advanced markets and supported durable change. This study helps clarify the lessons drawn from the East Asian growth miracle.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf025
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,Systemic Discrimination: Theory and Measurement*,"J Aislinn Bohren, Peter Hull and Alex Imas","Economists often measure discrimination as disparities arising from the direct effects of group identity. We develop new tools to model and measure systemic discrimination, capturing how discrimination in other decisions indirectly contributes to disparities. A novel experimental design, the iterated audit, identifies systemic discrimination. We illustrate these new tools in two field experiments. The first experiment shows how racial discrimination can accumulate across multiple rounds of hiring through the interaction of two forces: greater discrimination against inexperienced workers, which affects the opportunity to obtain experience, and high subsequent returns to experience. The second experiment shows how gender-based differences in the language of recommendation letters can translate into systemic gender discrimination in STEM hiring. We discuss how our findings qualify previous results on direct discrimination and how our tools can be used to target policy interventions.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf022

We ask how reliable these estimates are when the researcher’s model may be misspecified. We focus on the case of multivariate, potentially nonlinear models where the causal variable of interest is endogenous. Reliable estimates require that the researcher’s model is flexible enough to describe the effects of the endogenous variable approximately correctly. Reliable estimates do not require that the researcher has correctly specified the role of the exogenous controls in the model. However, if the role of the controls is misspecified, reliable estimates require a property we call strong exclusion. Strong exclusion depends on having sufficiently many instruments that are unrelated to the controls. We discuss how practitioners can achieve strong exclusion, and illustrate our findings with an application to a differentiated goods model of demand for beer.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf018
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,"The Race Between Education, Technology, and the Minimum Wage*",Jonathan Vogel,What is the effect of the real minimum wage on wages and inequality? I develop a theory that nests the race between education and technology. The theory predicts that the effect of changes in minimum wages is initially small but grows over time. I present empirical evidence of these dynamic effects: the elasticity of real wages grows substantially over a three-year period. I show that minimum wages help rationalize a considerable decline in real wages of low-education workers in the 1980s and play a role in shaping the evolution of the U.S. college premium.,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf014
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,Voluntary Minimum Wages: The Local Labor Market Effects of National Retailer Policies*,Ellora Derenoncourt and David Weil,"Low unionization rates, a falling real federal minimum wage, and outsourcing have hampered wage growth in the low-wage sector in the United States for several decades. In recent years (2014–2023), a number of large private retailers—including some of the largest employers in the United States—have opted to institute or raise company-wide, voluntary minimum wages (VMWs) for their employees. We use anonymized payroll data from a large credit bureau and a major payroll provider to study the effects of these national retailer policies on adopting employers’ own wages and employment as well as their spillovers to other employers in shared local labor markets, variously defined. Using stacked event studies centered around multiple VMW events and a continuous treatment variable defined as the gap between local-area wages and the company minimum, we find that VMWs result in sizable wage increases and reductions in turnover at the companies that implement them. Turning to wages at other companies, we estimate small, often economically negligible, spillover effects across multiple measures of exposure to VMWs and numerous definitions of relevant competitors, including firms connected by worker flows. Together, the evidence points to little role for strategic interactions in the transmission of large retailers’ wage policies to other firms. Voluntary minimum wage policies have affected over 3 million jobs at adopting employers, yet their impact on the broader labor market is limited.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf016

Households saving via nominal government bonds face a choice whether to acquire costly information about future government surpluses. They trade off the cost of acquiring information about the surpluses that back bond repayment against the benefit of a more informed saving decision. Through the information channel, small changes in the economic environment can trigger large responses in consumer behavior and prices. This setting explains why there can be long stretches of time during which government surpluses have large movements with little inflation response; then at some point, something snaps, and a sudden inflation takes off that is strongly responsive to incoming fiscal news.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf012

Using the 2008 tax rebate as a case study, we calibrate a standard macro model with the estimated micro MPCs to construct counterfactual macroeconomic consumption paths in the absence of a rebate. The counterfactual paths imply that consumption expenditures would have plummeted in spring and summer 2008 and mostly recovered in September 2008. We use narratives and forecasts to argue that these paths are implausible. We show that standard two-way fixed effect estimates of the micro MPCs are upward biased. When we correct for the biases, we estimate smaller micro MPCs using the CEX data than the previous literature. We show that realistic modifications of the model result in general equilibrium forces that dampen rather than amplify micro MPCs. The combination of smaller micro MPCs and dampening general equilibrium forces implies general equilibrium consumption multipliers that are below 0.2.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf015
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,Collective Bargaining for Women: How Unions Can Create Female-Friendly Jobs*,"Viola Corradini, Lorenzo Lagos and Garima Sharma","We study the role of unions in improving workplaces for women. Starting in 2015, Brazil’s largest trade union federation made women central to its agenda. Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages variation in union affiliation to this federation, we find that “bargaining for women” increased female-friendly amenities in collective bargaining agreements and in practice. These changes led women to queue for jobs at treated establishments and separate from them less—both revealed-preference measures of firm value. We find no evidence that gains came at the expense of wages, employment, or firm profits. Better amenities instead reduced turnover and absenteeism, suggesting greater worker satisfaction and effort. Larger improvements occurred where women initially composed a lower share of workers or union leaders. Our findings show that shifting union priorities toward women improved workplaces without meaningful trade-offs and benefited both workers and employers. They illustrate the potential for unions to improve workplace quality by focusing on the needs of less represented workers.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf024

Our identification approach is based on the novel insight that by varying the amount of information on future realizations of stochastic variables, discrete-choice experiments can identify not only preferences but also subjective beliefs. We formally prove this result in a general setting and apply it to design a strategic survey instrument to measure Rajasthani parents’ subjective beliefs over the joint distribution of girls’ age of marriage, education, and marriage match quality. Our approach allows us to quantify the importance of perceived marriage market returns to education and youth, and perform various counterfactual simulation exercises. We find that eliminating the perceived marriage market return to education causes a 60% drop in the number of girls still in school at age 16, and almost none continue their education by age 18.

From the late 1970s to the 1990s, Gautreaux moved thousands of Black families into predominantly white neighborhoods to support racial and economic integration. We link historical program records to administrative data and use plausibly exogenous variation in neighborhood placements to study how desegregating moves affect children in the long run. Being placed in the predominantly white neighborhoods targeted by the program significantly increases children’s future lifetime earnings and wealth. These moves also increase the likelihood of marriage and particularly raise the probability of being married to a white spouse. Moreover, placements through Gautreaux affect neighborhood choices in adulthood. Those placed in predominantly white neighborhoods during childhood live in more racially diverse areas with higher rates of upward mobility nearly 40 years later.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf011

We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3%, with effects persisting for at least 10 years. Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and reduced air pollution appears to be a quantitatively important mechanism. Incorporating our estimates of procyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomic framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf023

Using novel data on school district bonds, test scores, and house prices across 29 U.S. states and a research design based on narrowly decided elections with staggered timing, we find that increased capital spending in schools significantly improves test scores and is efficient on average. However, the effects vary widely depending on the type of project and the characteristics of the school district. Investments in essential infrastructure, such as HVAC systems or pollutant removal, yield notable improvements in student performance, while expenditures on athletic facilities show no measurable academic benefit.

The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,“Descended from Immigrants and Revolutionists”: How Family History Shapes Immigration Policy Making*,"James Feigenbaum, Maxwell Palmer and Benjamin Schneer","Does family history matter for policy making in democracies? Linking members of Congress (MCs) to the census, we observe countries of birth for members, their parents, and their grandparents, allowing us to measure ancestry for the politicians in office when U.S. immigration policy changed dramatically, from closing the border in the 1920s to reshaping admittance criteria in the 1960s. We find that legislators descended from immigrant parents or grandparents support more permissive immigration legislation. They are also less likely to speak negatively about immigration in speeches before Congress. A regression discontinuity design analyzing close elections, which addresses district-level selection and holds district composition constant, confirms our results on roll call voting and speech. Efforts to account for selection into immigration—such as comparing international immigrants to domestic migrants and exploiting variation in restrictive legislation targeting specific regions of origin—further confirm the relationship between family immigration experience and more permissive stances on immigration policy. We then explore mechanisms, finding support for in-group identity in connecting family history with policy making. MCs name their children in ways that express immigrant identity, and immigrant-descended MCs discuss immigration using more personal frames, emphasizing family over economic considerations. Our findings illustrate the important role of personal background in legislative behavior in democratic societies, even on major and controversial topics like immigration, and suggest how experiences transmitted from previous generations can inform lawmakers’ views.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf017
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,The Evolutionary Stability of Moral Foundations*,"Michelle Avataneo, Thomas Norman and Nicola Persico","Moral foundations theory is an influential empirical description of moral perception. According to this theory, individuals make moral judgments based on five distinct “moral foundations”: care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity. We provide a theory that explores the claimed evolutionary basis for these moral foundations. The theory conceptualizes these five moral foundations as specific modifications of fitness payoffs in a 2 × 2 game. We find that the five foundations are distinguishable from each other and evolutionarily stable. However, they are not a minimal set: strict subsets of the foundations suffice to describe all preferences that are evolutionarily stable. Not all evolutionarily stable foundations deliver social fitness improvement over the Nash equilibrium in the fitness game: we characterize which do. Finally, we study moral overdrive, that is, the situation in which the moral component of preferences totally dominates fitness payoffs and drives decision making entirely. While every one of the five foundations is compatible with moral overdrive in at least one fitness game, there is no fitness game in which moral overdrive is compatible with social fitness improvement. These results are partially extended to n × n games. We derive two testable implications from the theory and find empirical support for them.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf019
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,When Did Growth Begin? New Estimates of Productivity Growth in England from 1250 to 1870*,"Paul Bouscasse, Emi Nakamura and Jón Steinsson","We estimate productivity growth in England from 1250 to 1870. Real wages over this period were heavily influenced by plague-induced swings in the population. Our estimates account for these Malthusian dynamics. We find that productivity growth was zero before 1600. Productivity growth began in 1600—almost a century before the Glorious Revolution. Thus, the onset of productivity growth preceded the bourgeois institutional reforms of seventeenth-century England. We estimate productivity growth of 2% per decade between 1600 and 1800, increasing to 5% per decade between 1810 and 1860. Much of the increase in output growth during the Industrial Revolution is explained by structural change—the falling importance of land in production—rather than faster productivity growth. Stagnant real wages in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries—Engels’ Pause—is explained by rapid population growth putting downward pressure on real wages. Yet feedback from population growth to real wages is sufficiently weak to permit sustained deviations from the “iron law of wages” prior to the Industrial Revolution.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae046

Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output, while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for moderately rare problems, where human agents have less baseline experience but the system still has adequate training data.

The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,Cognitive Endurance as Human Capital*,"Christina Brown, Supreet Kaur, Geeta Kingdon and Heather Schofield","Schooling may build human capital not only by teaching academic skills but by expanding the capacity for cognition. We focus specifically on cognitive endurance: the ability to sustain effortful mental activity over a continuous stretch of time. As motivation, we document that globally and in the United States, the poor exhibit cognitive fatigue more quickly than the rich do across field settings; they also attend schools that offer fewer opportunities to practice thinking for continuous stretches. Using a field experiment with 1,600 Indian primary school students, we randomly increase the amount of time students spend in sustained cognitive activity during the school day—using either math problems (mimicking good schooling) or nonacademic games (providing a pure test of our mechanism). Each approach markedly improves cognitive endurance: students show 22% less decline in performance over time when engaged in intellectual activities—listening comprehension, academic problems, or IQ tests. They also exhibit increased attentiveness in the classroom and score higher on psychological measures of sustained attention. Moreover, each treatment improves students’ school performance by 0.09 standard deviations. This indicates that the experience of effortful thinking itself—even when devoid of any subject content—improves general cognitive capacity. Finally, we complement these results with quasi-experimental variation indicating that an additional year of schooling improves cognitive endurance, but only in higher-quality schools. Our findings suggest that schooling disparities may further disadvantage poor children by hampering the development of a core mental capacity.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae043

We collaborated with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to design and experimentally evaluate the world’s first particulate-matter emissions market, which covered industrial plants in a large Indian city. There are three main findings. First, the market functioned well. Treatment plants, randomly assigned to the emissions market, traded permits to become significant net sellers or buyers. After trading, treatment plants held enough permits to cover their emissions 99% of the time, compared with just 66% compliance with standards under the command-and-control status quo. Second, treatment plants reduced pollution emissions, relative to control plants, by 20%–30%. Third, the market reduced abatement costs by an estimated 11%, holding constant emissions. This cost-savings estimate is based on plant-specific marginal cost curves that we estimate from the universe of bids to buy and sell permits in the market. The combination of pollution reductions and low costs imply that the emissions market has mortality benefits that exceed its costs by at least 25 times.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf009

Women can seek legal abortions through a tutela, with cases randomly assigned to judges. Female judges are 20 percentage points (32%) less likely to deny abortion cases than are male judges, and we use the judge’s sex as an instrument for abortion denial. Denial of a wanted abortion has both immediate and lasting effects. It increases a woman’s risk of death by 2.5 percentage points within nine months, mainly due to unsafe abortion procedures, and raises the likelihood of carrying the pregnancy to term by 31 percentage points. Tracking outcomes up to 15 years later, we find that women denied an abortion experience more health issues, lower educational attainment, reduced labor force participation, and higher rates of single motherhood, poverty, and reliance on government assistance. Existing children, born before their mother sought an abortion, are less likely to attend school and are more likely to work.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf006
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,Race to the Bottom: Competition and Quality in Science*,Ryan Hill and Carolyn Stein,"This article investigates how competition to publish first and thereby establish priority affects the quality of scientific research. We begin by developing a model where scientists decide whether and how long to work on a given project. When deciding how long they should let their projects mature, scientists trade off the marginal benefit of higher-quality research against the marginal risk of being preempted. Projects with the highest scientific potential are the most competitive because they induce the most entry. Therefore, the model predicts these projects are also the most rushed and lowest quality. We test the predictions of this model in the field of structural biology using data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for structures of large macromolecules. An important feature of the PDB is that it assigns objective measures of scientific quality to each structure. As suggested by the model, we find that structures with higher ex ante potential generate more competition, are completed faster, and are lower quality. Consistent with the model, and with a causal interpretation of our empirical results, these relationships are mitigated when we focus on structures deposited by scientists who—by nature of their employment position—are less focused on publication and priority. We estimate that the costs associated with improving these low-quality structures are between $1.5 and $8.8 billion since the PDB’s founding in 1971.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf010

Our experiments focused on downstream medical debt that had been sold to debt collectors, and one of our experiments straddled an industry-wide pullback in the reporting of medical debt to the credit bureaus, allowing us to estimate the effects of debt relief with and without counterfactual reporting. We track outcomes using credit reports, collections account data, and a multimodal survey. There are three sets of results. First, we find a modest improvement in credit access when there is counterfactual credit reporting, but no impact on credit report outcomes when there is not. Second, we estimate that debt relief causes a moderate but statistically significant reduction in payments of existing medical bills. Third, we find no effects on survey measures of mental and physical health, healthcare utilization, and financial wellness.

We use new administrative data to measure physicians’ earnings and estimate the influence of health care policies on these earnings, physicians’ labor supply, and the allocation of talent. Combining the administrative registry of U.S. physicians with tax data, Medicare billing records, and survey responses, we find that physicians’ annual earnings average $350,000 and make up 8.6% of national health care spending. Business income makes up one-quarter of earnings and is systematically underreported in survey data. Earnings increase steeply early in the career, and there are major differences across specialties, regions, and firm sizes. The geographic pattern of earnings is unusual compared with other workers. We argue that these patterns reflect policy choices to subsidize demand for physician care, amplified by restrictions on physician entry, especially in certain specialties. Health policy has a major impact on the margin: 25% of physician fee revenue driven by Medicare reimbursements accrues to physicians personally. Physicians earn 8% of public money spent on insurance expansion.

Third, while initial hiring in new technologies is highly skill-biased, over time the mean skill level in new positions declines, drawing in an increasing number of lower-skilled workers.

First, we document that the media use syntactic structures—such as passive voice, nominalizations, and intransitive verbs—that obscure responsibility more often in cases of police killings than in cases of civilian killings. Through an online experiment, we demonstrate the significance of these syntactic differences, revealing that participants are less likely to hold police officers morally responsible and demand penalties when exposed to obfuscatory language, particularly in cases involving unarmed victims. Further analysis of news data shows greater use of obfuscatory language when the victims are unarmed or video footage is available—situations in which obfuscation may have the greatest impact. Exploring the causes of this differential obfuscation, we do not find evidence that it is driven by either demand-side factors or supply-side factors associated with TV station ownership and political leaning. Instead, our results suggest that narratives crafted by police departments are more likely drivers of media obfuscation.

This approach to the social construction of race provides a unified explanation of skin-tone inequality, racial homophily in marriage, the social status of mixed-race people, the psychological wage of Jim Crow, and legal restrictions on manumission.

Although the policy was blocked by a federal court injunction a week before it was supposed to take effect, I show that it nevertheless had a persistent positive impact on workers’ earnings. Leveraging a bunching design with administrative payroll data from ADP, I find that employers raised workers’ salaries to the $913 threshold even after the policy was repealed. Over the next 18 months, difference-in-difference estimates reveal that employers did not slow the wage growth of workers affected by the policy relative to those already earning above $913 per week, nor did they hire new employees at a lower pay rate. Real wages remained persistently elevated relative to what they would have been absent the policy and separation rates decreased among workers bunched at the $913 threshold. Comparing highly exposed firms to unaffected firms, I find an increase in employers’ wage bills but no change in aggregate employment. Taken together, the results indicate that temporary policies impacting wage levels can have permanent effects on the labor market. Survey responses collected by the Department of Labor suggest that morale concerns play a key role in driving the wage hysteresis.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjaf008
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,Trust at Scale: The Economic Limits of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains*,Eric Budish,"Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) invented a new kind of economic system that does not need the support of government or rule of law. Trust and security instead arise from a combination of cryptography and economic incentives, all in a completely anonymous and decentralized system. This article shows that Nakamoto’s novel form of trust, while undeniably ingenious, is deeply economically limited. The core argument is three equations. A zero-profit condition on the quantity of honest blockchain “trust support” (work, stake, etc.) and an incentive-compatibility condition on the system’s security against majority attack (the Achilles heel of all forms of permissionless consensus) together imply an equilibrium constraint, which says that the “flow” cost of blockchain trust has to be large at all times relative to the benefits of attacking the system. This is extremely expensive relative to traditional forms of trust and scales linearly with the value of attack. In scenarios that represent Nakamoto trust becoming a more significant part of the global financial system, the cost of trust would exceed global GDP. Nakamoto trust would become more attractive if an attacker lost the stock value of their capital in addition to paying the flow cost of attack, but this requires either collapse of the system (hardly reassuring) or external support from rule of law. The key difference between Nakamoto trust and traditional trust grounded in rule of law and complementary sources, such as reputations, relationships, and collateral, is economies of scale: society or a firm pays a fixed cost to enjoy trust over a large quantity of economic activity at low or zero marginal cost.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae033
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,A Welfare Analysis of Tax Audits Across the Income Distribution*,"William Boning, Nathaniel Hendren, Ben Sprung-Keyser and Ellen Stuart","We estimate the returns to IRS audits of taxpayers across the income distribution. We find an additional $1 spent auditing taxpayers above the 90th income percentile yields more than $12 in revenue, while audits of below-median income taxpayers yield $5. We construct our estimates by drawing from comprehensive internal accounting information and audit-level enforcement logs. We begin by estimating the average initial return to all audits of U.S. taxpayers filing in tax years 2010–2014. On average, $1 in audit spending initially raises $2.17 in revenue. Audits of high-income taxpayers are more costly, but the additional revenue raised more than offsets the costs. Audits of the 99–99.9th percentile have a 3.2:1 initial return; audits of the top 0.1% return 6.3:1. We then exploit the 40% audit reduction between tax years 2010 and 2014 to examine the returns to marginal audits. We find they exceed the returns to average audits. Revenues remain relatively unchanged, but marginal costs fall below average costs due to economies of scale. Next, we use randomly selected audits to examine the effect of an initial audit on future revenue. This individual deterrence effect produces at least three times more revenue than the initial audit. Deterrence effects are relatively consistent across the income distribution. This results in the 12:1 return above the 90th percentile. We conclude by estimating the welfare consequences of audits using the MVPF framework and comparing audits to other revenue-raising policies. We find that audits raise revenue at lower welfare cost.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae037
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,Measuring and Mitigating Racial Disparities in Tax Audits*,"Hadi Elzayn, Evelyn Smith, Thomas Hertz, Cameron Guage, Arun Ramesh, Robin Fisher, Daniel E Ho and Jacob Goldin","Tax authorities around the world rely on audits to detect underreported tax liabilities and to verify that taxpayers qualify for the benefits they claim. We study differences in Internal Revenue Service audit rates between Black and non-Black taxpayers. Because neither we nor the IRS observe taxpayer race, we propose and use a novel partial identification strategy to estimate these differences. Despite race-blind audit selection, we find that Black taxpayers are audited at 2.9 to 4.7 times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. An important driver of the disparity is differing audit rates by race among taxpayers claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Using counterfactual audit selection models to explore why the disparity arises, we find that maximizing the detection of underreported taxes would not lead to Black EITC claimants being audited at higher rates. Rather, the audit disparity among EITC claimants stems largely from a policy decision to prioritize detecting overclaims of refundable credits over other forms of noncompliance. Modifying the audit selection algorithm to target total underreported taxes while holding fixed the number of audited EITC claimants would reduce the share of audited taxpayers who are Black and would lead to more audits focused on accurate reporting of business income and deductions, fewer audits focused on the eligibility of claimed dependents, higher per audit costs, and more detected noncompliance.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae027
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,"The Global Race for Talent: Brain Drain, Knowledge Transfer, and Growth*",Marta Prato,"How does inventors’ migration affect international talent allocation, knowledge diffusion, and productivity growth? To answer this question, I build a novel two-country innovation-led endogenous growth model, where heterogeneous inventors produce innovations, learn from others, and make dynamic migration and return decisions. Migrants interact with individuals at origin and destination, diffusing knowledge within and across countries. To quantify this framework, I construct a micro-level data set of migrant inventors on the U.S.-EU corridor from patent data and document that (i) gross migration is asymmetric, with brain drain (net emigration) from the EU to the United States; (ii) migrants increase their patenting by 33% a year after migration; (iii) migrants continue working with inventors at origin after moving, although less frequently; (iv) migrants’ productivity gains spill over to their collaborators at origin, who increase patenting by 16% a year when a co-inventor emigrates. I calibrate the model to match the empirical results and study the effect of innovation and migration policy. A tax cut for foreigners and return migrants in the EU that eliminates the brain drain increases EU innovation but lowers U.S. innovation and knowledge spillovers. The former effect dominates in the first 25 years, increasing EU productivity growth by 3%, but the latter dominates in the long run, lowering growth by 3%. On the migration policy side, doubling the size of the U.S. H1B visa program increases U.S. and EU growth by 4% in the long run, because it sorts inventors to where they produce more innovations and knowledge spillovers.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae040

In the first stage, we vary race via AI-generated images only and find that Black profiles’ connection requests are 13% less likely to be accepted. Based on users’ CVs, we find widespread discrimination across social groups. In the second stage, we exogenously endow Black and white profiles with the same networks and ask connected users for career advice. We find no evidence of direct discrimination in information provision. However, when taking into account differences in the composition and size of networks, Black profiles receive substantially fewer replies.

We show that a key driver of whether people overinfer or underinfer is the strength of the information. Based on a model in which people know which direction to update in, but not exactly how much to update, we hypothesize that people will overinfer from weak signals and underinfer from strong signals. We then test this hypothesis across four different environments: abstract experiments, a naturalistic experiment, sports betting markets, and financial markets. In each environment, our consistent and robust finding is overinference from weak signals and underinference from strong signals.

Using data from 15 studies and 8,979 individuals, we find that women are believed to be more generous and more equality-oriented than men. This believed gender gap is robust across a wide range of contexts that vary in terms of strategic considerations, selfish motives, fairness concepts, and payoffs. Yet this believed gender gap is largely inaccurate. Consistent with models of associative memory, specifically the role of similarity and interference, the believed gender gap is correlated with recalled prior life experiences from similar contexts and significantly affected by an experience that may interfere with the recall process of prior memories, even though this interfering experience should not affect the beliefs of perfect-memory Bayesians. Application studies further reveal that believed gender differences extend to the household (i.e., beliefs about contributions to the home, family, and upbringing of children), the workplace (i.e., beliefs about equal pay), and policy views (i.e., beliefs about redistribution, equal access to education, healthcare, and affordable housing).",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae030
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,The Long-Run Impacts of Public Industrial Investment on Local Development and Economic Mobility: Evidence from World War II*,Andrew Garin and Jonathan Rothbaum,"This article studies the long-run effects of government-led construction of manufacturing plants on the regions where they were built and on individuals from those regions. Specifically, we examine publicly financed plants built in dispersed locations outside of major urban centers for security reasons during the U.S. industrial mobilization for World War II. Wartime plant construction had large and persistent effects on local development, characterized by an expansion of relatively high-wage manufacturing employment throughout the postwar era. These benefits were shared by incumbent residents; we find men born before World War II in counties where plants were built earned $1,200 (in 2020 dollars) or 2.5% more per year in adulthood relative to those born in counterfactual comparison regions, with larger benefits accruing to children of lower-income parents. The balance of evidence suggests that these individuals benefited primarily from the local expansion of higher-wage jobs to which they had access as adults, rather than because of developmental effects from exposure to better environments during childhood.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae031
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,"War Reparations, Structural Change, and Intergenerational Mobility*",Matti Mitrunen,"From 1944 to 1952, largely agrarian Finland had to export, on average, 4% of its yearly GDP in industrial products to the Soviet Union as war reparations. To meet the reparation demands, the Finnish state needed to provide extensive temporary support to Soviet-assigned industries with insufficient production capacity. This article documents the long-term effects of this extensive and temporary industrial policy on industrial and local development and on individual outcomes. Using newly digitized data sets, I show in a difference-in-differences setup that the short-term nonmarket production persistently and significantly increased the employment and production of the manufacturing industries exposed to the policy. These industries plausibly benefited from large initial investments and exposure to export markets associated with the war reparations. The episode further led to local development and structural change, as the more exposed regions became persistently more industrialized. I substantiate these within-Finland results with triple-difference setups using comparable Norwegian data. I use Finnish administrative data to study the long-term individual effects of the episode. Tracking individuals over 30 years, I show that the initial state investments and the persistent change in the local industrial structure increased long-term incomes, led to more educational attainment, and promoted the upward mobility of children and young adults in the more exposed regions before the war reparations period. The observed effects are driven by the more advanced heavy industry, which received the majority of state assistance.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae036
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,"Mandatory Notice of Layoff, Job Search, and Efficiency*","Jonas Cederlöf, Peter Fredriksson, Arash Nekoei and David Seim","In all OECD countries, mandatory notice (MN) policies require firms to inform workers in advance of a layoff. In our theoretical framework, MN helps workers avoid unemployment and find better jobs by encouraging them to search for a new job while still employed, thereby increasing future production. The magnitude of this production gain depends on the relative effectiveness of search while employed versus unemployed. But on-the-job search and diminished work incentives reduce current production. If future gains outweigh current production losses, longer advance notice improves production efficiency. If not, Coasian bargaining predicts that firms offer a larger severance instead of longer notice. With bargaining, the sole efficiency loss of MN is due to delayed separations of unproductive job matches. We test these predictions using novel Swedish administrative data on layoff notifications. Workers eligible for extended MN receive longer notice and larger severance, resulting in less exposure to nonemployment spells and higher-paying jobs. These favorable labor market outcomes are solely due to longer notice; in contrast, larger severance delays job finding and has no impact on wages. We also show that advance notice replaces job search while unemployed with more effective search while employed. On the production side, we document a productivity drop among notified workers and estimate a production loss due to delayed separations. Using our estimates of production gains and losses to evaluate the overall production efficiency, we conclude that the gains of MN seem to outweigh the losses.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae029
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,Do Financial Concerns Make Workers Less Productive?*,"Supreet Kaur, Sendhil Mullainathan, Suanna Oh and Frank Schilbach","Workers who are worried about their personal finances may find it hard to focus at work. If so, reducing financial concerns could increase productivity. We test this hypothesis in a sample of low-income Indian piece-rate manufacturing workers. We stagger when wages are paid out: some workers are paid earlier and receive a cash infusion while others remain liquidity constrained. The cash infusion leads workers to reduce their financial concerns by immediately paying off debts and buying household essentials. Subsequently, they become more productive at work: their output increases by 7% (0.11 std. dev.), and they make fewer costly, unintentional mistakes. Workers with more cash on hand thus not only work faster but also more attentively, suggesting improved cognition. These effects are concentrated among more financially constrained workers. We argue that mechanisms such as gift exchange or nutrition cannot account for our results. Instead, our findings suggest that financial strain, at least partly through psychological channels, has the potential to reduce earnings exactly when money is most needed.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae038

The model features a liquid asset and illiquid home equity, which households can use as collateral for borrowing. Because present bias substantially increases households’ marginal propensity to consume (MPC), present bias increases the effect of fiscal policy. Present bias also amplifies the effect of monetary policy, but at the same time, slows down the speed of monetary transmission. Interest rate cuts incentivize households to conduct cash-out refinances, which become targeted liquidity injections to high-MPC households. Present bias also introduces a motive for households to procrastinate refinancing their mortgages, which slows down the speed with which this monetary channel operates.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae026
The Quarterly Journal of Economics,2025,A Cognitive View of Policing*,"Oeindrila Dube, Sandy Jo MacArthur and Anuj K Shah","What causes adverse policing outcomes, such as excessive uses of force and unnecessary arrests? Prevailing explanations focus on problematic officers or deficient regulations and oversight. We introduce an overlooked perspective. We suggest that the cognitive demands inherent in policing can undermine officer decision making. Unless officers are prepared for these demands, they may jump to conclusions too quickly without fully considering alternative ways of seeing a situation. This can lead to adverse policing outcomes. To test this perspective, we created a new training that teaches officers to consider different ways of interpreting the situations they encounter. We evaluated this training using a randomized controlled trial with 2,070 officers from the Chicago Police Department. In a series of lab assessments, we find that treated officers were significantly more likely to consider a wider range of evidence and develop more explanations for subjects’ actions. Critically, we also find that training affected officer performance in the field, leading to reductions in uses of force, discretionary arrests, and arrests of Black civilians. Meanwhile, officer activity levels remained unchanged, and trained officers were less likely to be injured on duty. Our results highlight the value of considering the cognitive aspects of policing and demonstrate the power of using behaviorally informed approaches to improve officer decision making and policing outcomes.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/qje/qjae039
